    "# 📘 Phase 1 – Data Collection & Dataset Structuring\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of Phase 1 was to collect a clean, realistic, and representative dataset of financial annual reports to serve as the foundation for a RAG-based financial document intelligence system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than using small or synthetic datasets, the focus was on acquiring real-world regulatory-grade financial documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📂 Dataset Scope Decision\n",
    "\n",
    "We intentionally restricted the dataset to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Annual Reports only**\n",
    "* No quarterly filings\n",
    "* No event-based filings\n",
    "* No AGM notices or transcripts\n",
    "* No subsidiary-only reports\n",
    "\n",
    "This decision was made to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Maintain scope discipline\n",
    "* Ensure document consistency\n",
    "* Focus on the most comprehensive financial disclosures\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏢 Company Selection Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🇺🇸 US Companies (Industry Diversity)\n",
    "\n",
    "* NVIDIA – Technology / AI\n",
    "* JPMorgan Chase – Banking / Finance\n",
    "* Walmart – Retail / Operations\n",
    "* Pfizer – Healthcare / Pharma\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🇮🇳 Indian Companies\n",
    "\n",
    "* HDFC Bank – Banking\n",
    "* Reliance Industries – Diversified\n",
    "* Tata Consultancy Services – IT Services\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multi-industry coverage ensures model generalization.\n",
    "* Inclusion of one bank per region introduces regulatory-heavy documents.\n",
    "* Mix of tech, retail, pharma, banking, and conglomerate adds linguistic variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📅 Multi-Year Coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "Each company includes multiple years of annual reports (2022–2025 depending on availability).\n",
    "\n",
    "Indian financial years were standardized using the **ending fiscal year** convention:\n",
    "\n",
    "* FY 2022–23 → labeled as 2023\n",
    "* FY 2023–24 → labeled as 2024\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures consistency for year-over-year comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📁 Folder Structure Design\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable scalable RAG indexing and metadata filtering, we designed a structured dataset hierarchy:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "data/\n",
    "├── us/annual/<company>/\n",
    "└── india/annual/<company>/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each file follows the standardized naming format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "company_YYYY_annual.pdf\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This supports:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Automated metadata extraction\n",
    "* Year-based filtering\n",
    "* Company-based filtering\n",
    "* Clean vector indexing later\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Dataset Size\n",
    "\n",
    "* ~21 full annual reports\n",
    "* Each document: 150–200+ pages\n",
    "* Estimated total text volume: 1.5–2+ million words\n",
    "\n",
    "This provides a sufficiently large and realistic corpus without over-scaling.\n",

    "Challenge:\n",
    "Whether to label as 2022 or 2023.\n",

    "* Mixed year formats (2022-23, 2022-2023)\n",
    "* Missing suffixes\n",

    "#  Summary Explanation (Short Version)\n",
    "\n",
    "> In Phase 1, I curated a structured multi-year dataset of real annual financial reports across US and Indian companies. I standardized naming conventions, resolved fiscal year inconsistencies, and designed a scalable folder hierarchy to support metadata-aware RAG indexing. I intentionally limited the scope to annual reports to maintain dataset consistency and avoid uncontrolled expansion.\n",
