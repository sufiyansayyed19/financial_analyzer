In several emerging market countries, governments have used intellectual \nproperty policies as a tool to force innovators to accept less than fair value for medicines, as well as to advance industrial policy and localization \ngoals. The WTO continues to address the role of intellectual property in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic response. This includes the June \n2022 Ministerial Decision on the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, which seeks to make it easier for certain \nWTO members to issue a compulsory license on COVID-19 vaccines, and discussions continue on whether to expand that decision to COVID-19 \ntherapeutics and diagnostics.",
