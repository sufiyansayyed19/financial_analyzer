These \nestimates and assumptions can impact all elements of our financial statements. For example, in the consolidated statements of operations, \nestimates are used when accounting for deductions from revenues, determining the cost of inventory that is sold, allocating cost in the form of \ndepreciation and amortization, and estimating restructuring charges and the impact of contingencies, as well as determining provisions for \ntaxes on income.",
