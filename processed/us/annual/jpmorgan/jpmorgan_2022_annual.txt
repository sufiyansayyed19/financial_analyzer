Dear Fellow Shareholders,
Across the globe, 2022 was another year of significant challenges: from a terrible 
war in Ukraine and growing geopolitical tensions — particularly with China — to a 
politically divided America. Almost all nations felt the effects of global economic 
uncertainty, including higher energy and food prices, mounting inflation rates 
and volatile markets, and, of course, COVID-19’s lingering impacts. While all these 
experiences and associated turmoil have serious ramifications on our company, 
colleagues, clients and the countries in which we do business, their consequences 
on the world at large — with the extreme suffering of the Ukrainian people and 
the potential restructuring of the global order — are far more important. 
As these events unfold, America remains divided within its borders, and its 
global leadership role is being challenged outside of its borders. Nevertheless, 
this is the moment when we should put aside our differences and work with other 
Western nations to come together in defense of democracy and essential

Chief Executive

freedoms, including free enterprise. During other times of great crisis, we have 
seen America, in partnership with other countries around the globe, unite for a 
common cause. This is that moment again, when our country needs to work 
across public and private sectors to lead while improving American competitiveness 
— which also means re-establishing the American promise of providing equal 
access to opportunity for all. JPMorgan Chase, a company that historically has 
worked across borders and boundaries, will do its part to ensure the global 
economy is safe and secure. 
In spite of the unsettling landscape, 2022 was somewhat surprisingly another 
strong year for JPMorgan Chase, with the firm generating record revenue for 
the fifth year in a row, as well as setting numerous records in each of our lines 
of business. We earned revenue in 2022 of $132.3 billion1 and net income of 
$37.7 billion, with return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) of 18%, reflecting 
strong underlying performance across our businesses. We also maintained our 
quarterly common dividend of $1.00 per share and continued to reinforce our 
fortress balance sheet. We grew market share in several of our businesses and 
continued to make significant investments in products, people and technology 
while exercising strict credit discipline. In total, we extended credit and raised 
capital of $2.4 trillion for our consumer and institutional clients around the world. 
I remain proud of our company’s resiliency and of what our hundreds of thousands 
of employees around the world have achieved, collectively and individually. 
Throughout these challenging past few years, we never stopped doing all the 
things we should be doing to serve our clients and our communities. 
Adhering to our basic principles and strategies (see sidebar on Steadfast 
Principles on page 5) allows us to drive good organic growth and properly 
manage our capital (including dividends and stock buybacks), as we have

consistently demonstrated for decades. Our performance results are shown in 
the charts on pages 6-12, which illustrate how we have grown our franchises, 
how we compare with our competitors and how we look at our fortress balance 
sheet. I invite you to peruse them at your leisure. In addition, I urge you to read 
the CEO letters in this Annual Report, which will give you more specific details 
about our businesses and our plans for the future. 
As you know, we are champions of banking’s essential role in a community — 
its potential for bringing people together, for enabling companies and individuals 
to attain their goals, and for being a source of strength in difficult times. As 
I often remind our employees, the work we do matters and has impact. We help 
people and institutions finance and achieve their aspirations, lifting up 
individuals, homeowners, small businesses, larger corporations, schools, 
hospitals, cities and countries in all regions of the world. 

STEADFAST PRINCIPLES WORTH REPEATING
Looking back on the past two+ decades — 
starting from my time as CEO of Bank One 
in 2000 — there is one common theme: 
our unwavering dedication to help clients, 
communities and countries throughout 
the world. It is clear that our financial discipline, constant investment in innovation 
and ongoing development of our people 
are what enabled us to achieve this consistency and commitment. In addition, 
across the firm, we uphold certain steadfast tenets that are worth repeating. 
First, our work has very real human 
impact. While JPMorgan Chase stock is 
owned by large institutions, pension 
plans, mutual funds and directly by single 
investors, in almost all cases the ultimate 
beneficiaries are individuals in our communities. More than 100 million people in 
the United States own stock; many, in one 
way or another, own JPMorgan Chase 
stock. Frequently, these shareholders are 
veterans, teachers, police officers, firefighters, healthcare workers, retirees or 
those saving for a home, education or 
retirement. Often, our employees also 
bank these shareholders, as well as their 
families and their companies. Your management team goes to work every day 
recognizing the enormous responsibility 
that we have to all of our shareholders. 
Second, shareholder value can be built 
only if you maintain a healthy and vibrant 
company, which means doing a good job 
of taking care of your customers, employees and communities. Conversely, how 
can you have a healthy company if you 
neglect any of these stakeholders? As 
we have learned over the past few years, 
there are myriad ways an institution 
can demonstrate its compassion for its 
employees and its communities while still 
upholding shareholder value.
this letter. We recognize our strengths and 
vulnerabilities, and we play our hand as 
best we can.
Sixth, we operate with a very important 
silent partner — the U.S. government — 
noting as my friend Warren Buffett points 
out that his company’s success is predicated upon the extraordinary conditions 
our country creates. He is right to say to 
his shareholders that when they see the 
American flag, they all should say thank 
you. We should, too. JPMorgan Chase is a 
healthy and thriving company, and we 
always want to give back and pay our fair 
share. We do pay our fair share — and we 
want it to be spent well and have the 
greatest impact. To give you an idea of 
where our taxes and fees go: In the last 
10 years, we paid more than $43 billion in 
federal, state and local taxes in the United 
States and almost $19 billion in taxes outside of the United States. We also paid the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
over $10 billion so that it has the resources 
to cover failure in the American banking 
sector. Our partner — the federal government — also imposes significant regulations upon us, and it is imperative that we 
meet all legal and regulatory requirements 
imposed on our company. 
Seventh and finally, we know the foundation of our success rests with our people. 
They are the frontline, both individually 
and as teams, serving our customers and 
communities, building the technology, 
making the strategic decisions, managing 
the risks, determining our investments 
and driving innovation. However you view 
the world — its complexity, risks and 
opportunities — a company’s prosperity 
requires a great team of people with guts, 
brains, integrity, enormous capabilities 
and high standards of professional excellence to ensure its ongoing success.
Third, while we don’t run the company 
worrying about the stock price in the 
short run, in the long run we consider 
our stock price a measure of our progress over time. This progress is a function of continual investments in our 
people, systems and products, in good 
and bad times, to build our capabilities. 
These important investments will also 
drive our company’s future prospects 
and position it to grow and prosper for 
decades. Measured by stock performance, our progress is exceptional. 
For example, whether looking back 
10 years or even farther to 2004, when 
the JPMorgan Chase/Bank One merger 
took place, we have significantly outperformed the Standard & Poor’s 500 
Index and the Standard & Poor’s Financials Index. 
Fourth, we are united behind basic principles and strategies (you can see the 
How We Do Business principles on our 
website) that have helped build this 
company and made it thrive — from 
maintaining a fortress balance sheet, 
constantly investing and nurturing talent to fully satisfying regulators, continually improving risk, governance and 
controls, and serving customers and 
clients while lifting up communities 
worldwide. This philosophy is embedded 
in our company culture and influences 
nearly every role in the firm. 
Fifth, we strive to build enduring businesses, which rely on and benefit from 
one another, but we are not a conglomerate. This structure helps generate our 
superior returns. Nonetheless, despite 
our best efforts, the walls that protect 
this company are not particularly high — 
and we face extraordinary competition. 
I have written about this reality extensively in the past and cover it again in 

An important note to describe why we are showing the table above: The loan loss reserve 
accounting rules — which are life-of-loan estimated losses based upon probability-based economic 
scenarios — generate huge swings in earnings that can be unrelated to actual credit performance. 
This was particularly true for the COVID-19 years when, during the first six months of the pandemic, 
we built approximately $16 billion in reserves. Then in the next six quarters, we released essentially 
the equivalent number. We did so only because the scenarios used to estimate future credit losses 
changed dramatically.
The table above shows reported net income, with and without loan loss reserve changes. 
Throughout this period, the credit portfolio was healthy, and charge-offs remained below 
pre-pandemic levels. Either way, the company had strong absolute and relative performance.

Why We Are Proud of 
JPMorgan Chase
Our vision is simple and unchanged: We aim to be 
the most respected financial services firm in the 
world, serving corporations and individuals. To 
that end, it is imperative that we run a healthy, 
vibrant and responsible company. In addition to 
traditional banking, we do a lot to help the communities in which we operate, which, in turn, provides the foundation for increased opportunity and 
prosperity for all. And just to note, while we are 
proud of the good things we do every day, we are 
also an organization that acknowledges the mistakes we make along the way, which is important 
to do. And when we do make mistakes, we own up 
to them, learn from them and then move on. 
UNITED BY PRINCIPLES AND PURPOSE
We’ve always had — and published — principles to 
guide how we do business, with values embedded 
within them, which I described in the preceding 
section. These tenets unite our company across 
the globe. To complement these guidelines, we 
recently developed a clearly stated purpose — 
Make dreams possible for everyone, everywhere, 
every day — to knit together our values with our 
everyday business principles and explain how we 
have done business for years. 
While our company has a rich history, is proud of 
the critical role it plays in powering economic 
growth and has done exceptionally well over the 
past 200 years, research has shown that purpose-driven companies achieve stronger business 
results and have greater impact by doing better for 
their customers, employees and shareholders. Our 
intention in documenting our purpose for ourselves 
is to help energize our employees, differentiate our 
company from our competitors, and push our organization to innovate on behalf of our clients, colleagues and communities. In addition, we are 
launching a new effort — internally and externally 
— to showcase how the work we do matters and has 
tangible impact locally and around the world. 
In detailing the elements of our purpose, shown in 
the following sidebar, we have tried to make every 
word meaningful.

WHY WE ARE PROUD OF JPMORGAN CHASE 

We are also dedicated to corporate responsibility, 
and our efforts extend far beyond significant philanthropic contributions (which total more than 
$350 million a year globally). For example, at the 
local level, we support educational institutions and 
work-skills training programs around the world, as 
well as finance affordable housing and small businesses. In addition, we help formulate broadbased policies that are good for countries on 
issues such as healthcare, infrastructure, education and employment. Sometimes we promote specific initiatives; for example, programs that help 
individuals with a criminal background get a second chance. Lest anyone think that I’ve become a 
little soft, rest assured your CEO is a red-blooded, 
patriotic, free-enterprise and free-market capitalist (properly regulated, of course) and finds nothing inconsistent with the multifaceted ways we use 
our capabilities to lift up our communities.
Part of our corporate responsibility efforts are 
focused on progress toward diversity, equity and 
inclusion (DEI), which is detailed in the sidebar 
below. And the sidebar on pages 18 and 19 shows 
how our work on the ground translates to a particular geography, in this case the state of Ohio.
HIGHLIGHTING OUR DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION EFFORTS
We seek to create a company that reflects the 
diverse communities that we serve, a workplace 
in which all employees feel they belong and are 
respected. We believe these efforts not only make 
us a positive work environment, but they also 
make our company stronger, our business more 
profitable and our institution a better global corporate citizen. This objective is integrated into how 
we do business every day. Some of our recent 
progress is highlighted below:
• We continue to identify ways to support our 
military veterans. In 2011, along with 10 other 
companies, JPMorgan Chase co-founded the 
Veteran Jobs Mission (VJM), a coalition committed to hiring at least 100,000 veterans by 2020. 
Since its founding, more than 300 member companies representing various industries across 
the United States have reported over 880,000 
veteran hires. In 2022, VJM increased its goal 
to 2 million veteran hires and 200,000 military 
spouse hires over the next decade. JPMorgan 
Chase alone has hired over 18,000 veterans 
since 2011 and currently employs approximately 
3,000 military spouses.
• We continue to make strides in developing a 
diversified workplace. By year-end, women represented 49% of the firm’s total workforce. Overall, Hispanic, Asian and Black representation 
grew to 21%, 18% and 14%, respectively. In 2022, 
the number of employees who self-identified 
as LGBTQ+ increased by 35% year-over-year, 
following 50% year-over-year growth in 2021.
• The firm’s Office of Disability Inclusion (ODI) continues to lead strategy and initiatives aimed at 
advancing careers while helping the firm be a 
bank of choice for people with disabilities. As 
ODI kicked off its business growth and entrepreneurship work in 2022, it provided business 
coaching to over 225 entrepreneurs with 
disabilities and commissioned research with 
the National Disability Institute, which identified 
unique opportunities and challenges among 
small business owners who have a disability.
An update on our $30 billion racial equity 
commitment
What began in 2020 as a $30 billion, five-year 
commitment is now transforming into a consistent 
business practice that our lines of business deliver 
each day to support Black, Hispanic, Latino and 
other underserved communities.
By the end of 2022, we reported nearly $29 billion 
in progress toward our original goal. But our 
focus is not on how much money is deployed — 
it is on long-term impact and outcomes. 

WHY WE ARE PROUD OF JPMORGAN CHASE 

Here are some details on our program’s progress 
through 2022: 
• Supplier diversity. In 2022, our firm spent 
approximately $2.1 billion directly with diverse 
suppliers — an increase of 25% over 2021. As a 
part of our racial equity commitment, $400 
million was spent in 2022 with over 200 Black-, 
Hispanic- and Latino-owned businesses — more 
than doubling the amount spent in 2021. 
• Affordable rental housing. Through our 
Affordable Housing Preservation program, we 
approved funding of approximately $18 billion in 
loans to incentivize the preservation of nearly 
170,000 affordable housing rental units across 
the United States. Additionally, we financed 
approximately $4 billion for the construction 
and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing. 
• Homeownership. In a rising rate environment, 
we continue our efforts to provide homeownership opportunities for Black, Hispanic and Latino 
households across all income levels, including 
advocating for policies that reduce barriers to 
owning a home. The biggest barriers are upfront 
cash for a down payment and closing costs. 
In 2022, we expanded our $5,000 Chase Homebuyer Grant program to include over 11,000 
majority Black, Hispanic and Latino communities. Since our grant program began in 2021, 
we have provided about 2,700 grants totaling 
$13.5 million. We have also assisted Black, 
Hispanic and Latino homeowners with 11,500 
incremental home loans together worth over 
$4 billion, mainly driven by refinance activity 
when rates were low. 
• Small business. In 2022, we launched a Special 
Purpose Credit Program, the first of its kind 
nationally, to expand credit access for small businesses in majority Black, Hispanic and Latino 
communities, which have traditionally been 
underserved. When I visited Houston last year, 
I met Sherice and Steve Garner, Chase customers 
who own a local barbecue business, Southern Q. 
They are examples of the types of customers we 
want to support. Previously, they had been using 
their personal bank account to run their business. We helped them secure a small business 
loan to purchase their business location. To 
assist more families like the Garners, we hired 
45 local senior business consultants to provide 
one-on-one coaching and host educational 
events, community workshops and business 
training seminars to support minority entrepreneurs across 21 U.S. cities. 
• Minority depository institutions (MDI) and 
community development financial institutions 
(CDFI). We invested more than $100 million in 
equity in diverse financial institutions and provided over $200 million in incremental financing 
to CDFIs to support communities that lack access 
to traditional financing. We also helped them 
build their capacity so they can provide a 
greater number of critical services like mortgages and small business loans. Additionally, 
we do not charge a fee for nearly all our participating MDI and CDFI customers who make a 
withdrawal at a Chase ATM.
• Access to banking. We helped more than 
400,000 customers open low-cost checking 
accounts; we’ve also opened 13 Community Center 
branches (a total of 15 Community Center 
branches since 2019), often in areas with larger 
Black, Hispanic and Latino populations; and we 
hired over 140 Community Managers in underserved communities to build relationships with 
community leaders, nonprofits and small businesses. These Community Center branches are 
unique spaces in the heart of urban communities with more space than standard bank 
branches to host local events, small business 
mentoring sessions and financial health seminars. The majority were built with minority 
contractors from the community; we hire staff 
locally and we engage local artists to help 
ensure these locations complement their neighborhood. We have been pleased by the dramatic 
positive effect these specialized branches have 
had on their communities to date and expect to 
expand the program.
By driving inclusive economic growth, we can help 
create a brighter future for all, no matter where 
people live or the circumstances they’re born into. 
We provide regular updates on our corporate website about our progress toward equity and equality, and I encourage you to read about the meaningful impact we’re making within our firm and 
with the people we serve. 

WHY WE ARE PROUD OF JPMORGAN CHASE 

THE STATE OF OHIO: HOW JPMORGAN CHASE DRIVES 
COMMUNITY GROWTH 
Our support to local financial firms:
• We have provided nearly $20 billion in credit 
and capital over the last five years for financial 
institutions such as local banks, insurance 
companies, asset managers and securities firms. 
• Importantly, we bank 19 of Ohio’s regional, 
midsized and community banks, helping them 
serve local communities and accomplish their 
other goals. 
Our support to small businesses: 
• By the end of 2022, loan balances for small 
business customers in Ohio totaled over $800 
million — funds being used to run and grow 
companies and create jobs. 
— Includes support for distribution of the 
federal government’s Paycheck Protection 
Program (PPP) to help small businesses 
navigate the pandemic in 2020 and 2021
• In 2022 alone, JPMorgan Chase helped over 
160,000 small businesses thrive and grow through 
access to customers, capital and networks, giving 
us the second largest business banking market 
share in the state. We also offered some 106,000 
hours of advice and support to small businesses.
Our support to consumer banking needs:
• We operate nearly 225 branches and over 
530 ATMs across the state. 
• To help Ohioans build wealth and be financially 
healthy, we have provided more than 4 million 
savings, checking and credit card accounts, 
enabling these consumers to gain access to 
resources such as free financial health services, 
as well as mortgage and auto loans. 
— Ranked as the second largest provider of 
consumer banking in Ohio with over 2 million 
checking and savings accounts and customer 
deposits totaling nearly $37 billion in 2022
• In 2022, we oversaw more than $20 billion in 
investment and annuity assets for clients. 
When JPMorgan Chase does business in a community, we do more than just open branches. We lend 
to small, midsized and big businesses; we hire, pay 
well and provide great benefits; and we finance 
hospitals, schools, grocery stores, homes, automobiles and governments. For more than 200 years, 
this approach has enabled us to make investments 
that have a lasting impact on local economies, 
families and neighborhoods while also supporting 
them in good and challenging times. 
We have been in Ohio since 1812, and our experience there serves as a great example of how our 
resources drive growth on the ground. 
Our support to government, higher education, 
healthcare and nonprofit organizations: 
• We serve approximately 150 government, higher 
education, healthcare and nonprofit clients 
throughout the state, and over the last five 
years, we provided nearly $9 billion in credit and 
capital to them. 
• Our clients range from University Hospitals 
Health System, Inc. to the Ronald McDonald 
House in Columbus and the University of Dayton 
in Dayton. 
• We are the primary treasury bank for Ohio State 
University and the primary bank for the city of 
Columbus; we also bank nearly 50 counties, 
cities and school districts across the state. 
Our support to investment and middle market 
banking clients:
• Our support includes $120 billion in credit and 
capital over the last five years for Commercial & 
Industrial clients such as energy, retail and auto 
businesses. 
• We have over 4,800 large and midsized clients in 
Ohio, up over 70% compared with 2019, which 
also includes emerging middle market companies 
owned by veterans, women, LGBTQ+ individuals 
and people of color. This gives us leading market 
shares in the state compared with other banks.

WHY WE ARE PROUD OF JPMORGAN CHASE 

Our business and community investments:
• The firm’s national $30 billion racial equity 
commitment takes place very specifically on 
the ground. Since the program began, we have 
committed more than $260 million across the 
state, including:
— Over $163 million in loans for Black, Hispanic 
and Latino households to purchase or refinance a home 
— $54 million financed through investments and 
loans for the construction and rehabilitation 
of affordable housing 
— $14 million in New Markets Tax Credit investments to support the Ronald McDonald House 
Charities in central Ohio
— Over $12 million spent with Black, Hispanic 
and Latino suppliers 
• We’ve committed $45 million in philanthropic 
support across the state since 2018 such as: 
— $5 million to support The 614 for Linden, a 
CDFI and nonprofit collaborative, in Columbus, 
which helped catalyze a $20 million fund for 
affordable housing; create or preserve nearly 
750 affordable housing units; provide 57 
microloans to local entrepreneurs; support 
technical assistance for over 100 small businesses; and increase wraparound services for 
prenatal care, as well as facilitate access to 
healthy food
Our impact as a proud employer in Ohio:
• Today, as the largest private employer in 
Columbus, JPMorgan Chase employs over 
20,000 Ohioans throughout the state, 
including more than 2,000 veterans and

WHY WE ARE PROUD OF JPMORGAN CHASE 

Update on Specific Issues Facing 
Our Company
CLIMATE COMPLEXITY AND PLANNING 
The window for action to avert the costliest 
impacts of global climate change is closing. At the 
same time, the ongoing war in Ukraine is roiling 
trade relations across Europe and Asia and redefining the way countries and companies plan for 
energy security. The need to provide energy 
affordably and reliably for today, as well as make 
the necessary investments to decarbonize for 
tomorrow, underscores the inextricable links 
between economic growth, energy security and 
climate change. We need to do more, and we need 
to do so immediately. 
To expedite progress, governments, businesses 
and non-governmental organizations need to align 
across a series of practical policy changes that 
comprehensively address fundamental issues that 
are holding us back. Massive global investment in 
clean energy technologies must be done and must 
continue to grow year-over-year. 
At the same time, permitting reforms are desperately needed to allow investment to be done in any 
kind of timely way. We may even need to evoke 
eminent domain — we simply are not getting the 
adequate investments fast enough for grid, solar, 
wind and pipeline initiatives. Policies like the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Creating Helpful 
Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and 
Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) — 
that hold the potential to unlock over $1 trillion in 
clean technology development — need to be implemented effectively. The upside is undeniable: Widespread investing across the private sector will aid 
domestic manufacturing, invigorate research and 
development in green innovation, help create resilient supply chains, lift up local economies and build 
the U.S. clean energy workforce by up to 9 million 
jobs over the next decade. While major advances 
have been made in the last few years on technology 
to help this cause, we are hopeful that the great 
American innovation machine (most advancements 
will ultimately come from the huge capabilities and 
capital of America’s largest companies) will find the 
additional technologies that are desperately 
needed. There is a downside — massive, inefficient 
and malinvestment of capital. I talk more about this 
in the last section on public policy.
Polarization, paralysis and basic lack of analysis 
cannot keep us from addressing one of the most 
complex challenges of our time. Diverse stakeholders need to come together, seeking the best 
answers through engagement around our common 
interest. Bolstering growth must go hand in hand 
with both securing an energy future and meeting 
science-based climate targets for future 
generations. 
AI, DATA AND OUR JOURNEY TO THE 
CLOUD 
Artificial intelligence (AI) is an extraordinary and 
groundbreaking technology. AI and the raw 
material that feeds it, data, will be critical to our 
company’s future success — the importance of 
implementing new technologies simply cannot be 
overstated. We already have more than 300 AI 
use cases in production today for risk, prospecting, marketing, customer experience and fraud 
prevention, and AI runs throughout our payments 
processing and money movement systems across 
the globe. AI has already added significant value 
to our company. For example, in the last few 
years, AI has helped us to significantly decrease 
risk in our retail business (by reducing fraud and 
illicit activity) and improve trading optimization 
and portfolio construction (by providing optimal 
execution strategies, automating forecasting and 
analytics, and improving client intelligence).
We currently have over 1,000 people involved in 
data management, more than 900 data scientists 
(AI and machine learning (ML) experts who create 
new models) and 600 ML engineers (who write the 
code to put models in production). This group is 

UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY

focused on AI and ML across natural language 
processing, time series analysis and reinforcement 
learning to name a few. We’re imagining new ways 
to augment and empower employees with AI 
through human-centered collaborative tools and 
workflow, leveraging tools like large language 
models, including ChatGPT. 
We also have a 200-person, top-notch AI research 
group looking at the hardest problems and new 
frontiers in finance. We were recently ranked #1 on 
the Evident AI Index, the first public benchmark of 
major banks on their AI maturity. We take the 
responsible use of AI very seriously and have an 
interdisciplinary team of ethicists helping us prevent 
unintended misuse, anticipate regulation, and promote trust with our clients, customers and communities. AI and data use is complex; it must be done 
following the laws of the land. But it is an absolute 
necessity that we do it both for the benefits I just 
described and, equally, for the protection of the 
company and the financial system — because you 
can be certain that the bad guys will be using it, too. 
All of our technology groups firmwide work 
together in a flywheel of innovation and deliver 
state-of-the-art improvements. We are proud that 
our AI teams have contributed top-quality novel 
research and compelling solutions that are transforming more and more business cases every day.
AI is inextricably linked with cloud-based systems, 
whether public or private, and digital capabilities. 
Our company needs the cloud for its on-demand 
compute capacity, flexibility, extensibility and 
speed. Native cloud-based approaches will ultimately be faster, cheaper and aligned with the 
newest AI techniques, and they will give us easy 
access to constantly evolving developer tools. 
We have spent over $2 billion building new, cloudbased data centers and are working to modernize 
a significant portion of our applications (and their 
related databases) to run in both our public and 
private cloud environments. To date, we have 
migrated approximately 38% of our applications 
to the cloud, meaning over 50% of our application 
portfolio (this includes third-party, cloud-based 
applications) is running on modern environments. 
This journey to the cloud is hard work but necessary. Unlocking the full potential of the cloud and 
nearly 550 petabytes of data will require replatforming (putting data in a cloud-eligible format) 
and refactoring (i.e., rewriting) approximately 
4,000 applications. This effort will involve not just 
the 57,000 employees we have in technology but 
the dedicated time of firmwide management teams 
to help in the process. 
BANKING TURMOIL AND REGULATORY 
GOALS 
The recent failures of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in 
the United States and Credit Suisse in Europe, and 
the related stress in the banking system, underscore that simply satisfying regulatory requirements is not sufficient. Risks are abundant, and 
managing those risks requires constant and vigilant scrutiny as the world evolves. Regarding the 
current disruption in the U.S. banking system, most 
of the risks were hiding in plain sight. Interest rate 
exposure, the fair value of held-to-maturity (HTM) 
portfolios and the amount of SVB’s uninsured 
deposits were always known — both to regulators 
and the marketplace. The unknown risk was that 
SVB’s over 35,000 corporate clients — and activity 
within them — were controlled by a small number 
of venture capital companies that moved their 
deposits in lockstep. 
It is unlikely that any recent change in regulatory 
requirements would have made a difference in 
what followed. Instead, the recent rapid rise of 
interest rates placed heightened focus on the 
potential for rapid deterioration of the fair value of 
HTM portfolios and, in this case, the lack of stickiness of certain uninsured deposits. Ironically, 
banks were incented to own very safe government 
securities because they were considered highly liquid by regulators and carried very low capital 
requirements. Even worse, the stress testing based 
on the scenario devised by the Federal Reserve 
Board (the Fed) never incorporated interest rates 
at higher levels. This is not to absolve bank management — it’s just to make clear that this wasn’t 
the finest hour for many players. All of these colliding factors became critically important when the 
marketplace, rating agencies and depositors 
focused on them. 

UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY

As I write this letter, the current crisis is not yet 
over, and even when it is behind us, there will be 
repercussions from it for years to come. But 
importantly, recent events are nothing like what 
occurred during the 2008 global financial crisis 
(which barely affected regional banks). In 2008, 
the trigger was a growing recognition that $1 trillion 
of consumer mortgages were about to go bad — 
and they were owned by various types of entities 
around the world. At that time, there was enormous leverage virtually everywhere in the financial system. Major investment banks, Fannie Mae 
and Freddie Mac, nearly all savings and loan institutions, off-balance sheet vehicles, AIG and banks 
around the world — all of them failed. This current 
banking crisis involves far fewer financial players 
and fewer issues that need to be resolved.
These failures were not good for banks of 
any size.
Any crisis that damages Americans’ trust in their 
banks damages all banks — a fact that was known 
even before this crisis. While it is true that this 
bank crisis “benefited” larger banks due to the 
inflow of deposits they received from smaller institutions, the notion that this meltdown was good 
for them in any way is absurd. 
Let’s be very thoughtful in our reaction to 
recent events.
While this crisis will pass, lessons will be learned, 
which will result in some changes to the regulatory 
system. However, it is extremely important that we 
avoid knee-jerk, whack-a-mole or politically motivated responses that often result in achieving the 
opposite of what people intended. Now is the time 
to deeply think through and coordinate complex 
regulations to accomplish the goals we want, 
eliminating costly inefficiencies and contradictory 
policies. Very often, rules are put in place in one 
part of the framework without appreciating their 
consequences in combination with other regulations. America has had, and continues to have, 
the best and most dynamic financial system in 
the world — from various types of investors to its 
banks, rule of law, investor protections, transparency, exchanges and other features. We do not 
want to throw the baby out with the bath water. 
We should have common goals on how we 
want the banking system to work. 
• We want to strengthen regional, midsized and 
community banks, which are essential to the 
American economic system. They fill a critical 
role in small communities, offering local knowledge and local relationships that some large 
banks simply can’t provide — or can’t provide 
cost-effectively. Overall, we want to maintain 
the extraordinary strength this tiered system 
affords. JPMorgan Chase directly supports this 
goal as we are one of the largest bankers in 
America to regional and community banks. We 
bank approximately 350 of America’s 4,000+ 
banks across the country. This means we make 
loans to them or raise capital for them. In addition, we process payments for them, finance 
some of their mortgage activities, advise them 
on acquisitions, provide them with interest rate 
swaps and foreign exchange, and buy and sell 
securities for them. And we also finance their 
local communities (think hospitals, schools and 
larger companies) in ways they cannot. 
• We need large, complex banks to continue 
to play a critical role in the U.S. and global 
financial system. And we need to recognize that 
they do so in a way regional banks can’t. Large 
banks are complex not because they want to be 
but because they operate in complex global 
markets. Regional banks simply cannot manage 
the scale and complexity of transactions in 50 or 
60 countries around the world to help some of 
America’s best and largest companies accomplish their goals. Think of equity, debt, M&A, 
research, swaps, foreign exchange, large payments systems, global custody and so on. It 
takes a global workforce with deep expertise 
and significant capabilities to provide these services. These large global banks finance not just 
the world’s largest companies but the world’s 
development institutions and even countries. 
Having some of the best large, complex banks in 
the world is essential to the success of America’s 
biggest companies, its economic system and its 
global competitiveness, which says nothing 
against the importance of having great midsized 
and community banks as well. And contrary to 

UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY

what some say — to be safe, a global bank needs 
both huge economies of scale and the strength 
of diversified earnings streams.
• We should want a system in which a bank 
failure does not cause undue panic and financial harm. While you don’t want banks to fail all 
the time, it should be allowed to happen, and the 
resolution should follow a completely prescribed 
process. In almost all bank failures, uninsured 
deposits never resulted in lost money — but 
the very fear of loss can cause a run on any bank 
having characteristics similar to a bank that has 
failed. Resolution and recovery regulations did 
not work particularly well during the recent 
crisis — we should bring clarity and reassurance 
to both the unwinding process and measures to 
reduce the risk of additional bank runs. It should 
also be noted that banks pay for any bank failure 
(through fees paid to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) as they pay for the whole 
financial regulatory system. And yes, while these 
costs are ultimately passed on to their customers 
— that is true for all industries — the cost is just 
the price of implementing proper regulations.
• We want proper transparency and strong regulations. However, it should be noted that regulations, the supervisory regime and the resolution 
regime currently in place did not stop SVB and 
Signature Bank from failing — and from causing 
systemwide issues. We should not aim for a regulatory regime that eliminates all failure but one 
that reduces the chance of failure and the odds 
of contagion. We should carefully study why this 
particular situation happened but not overreact. 
Strong regulations should not only minimize 
bank failures but also help to maintain the 
strength of banks as both the guardians of the 
financial system and engines that finance the 
great American economic machine.
• We should want market makers to have the 
ability to effectively intermediate, particularly 
in difficult markets, with central banks only stepping in during exceptional situations. In the last 
few years, we have had many situations in which 
disruptions in the market were, in my opinion, 
largely caused by certain regulations that did 
not improve the safety of the market maker but, 
instead, damaged the safety of the whole system. In addition, many of the new “shadow 
bank” market makers are fair-weather friends — 
they do not step in to help clients in tough times.
• We need banks to be there for their clients in 
tough times. And they have been. Banks can 
flex their capital and provide their clients with 
a lot of loans and liquidity when they really need 
it. For example, at the beginning of the COVID-19 
crisis in March 2020, banks deployed over $500 
billion in liquidity for clients and $500 billion in 
PPP loans — and this does not include banks’ 
share of the nearly $2 trillion in loans that 
entered forbearance. Banks also play a unique 
and fundamental role in the transmission of 
monetary policy because deposits in banks can 
be loaned out, effectively “creating” money. 
Some regulations and some accounting rules 
have become too procyclical and make it harder 
to do this.
• Regulation, particularly stress testing, should 
be more thoughtful and forward looking. It has 
become an enormous, mind-numbingly complex 
task about crossing t’s and dotting i’s. For example, the Fed’s stress test focuses on only one scenario, which is unlikely to happen. In fact, this 
may lull risk committee members at any institution into a false sense of security that the risks 
they are taking are properly vetted and can be 
easily handled. A less academic, more collaborative reflection of possible risks that a bank faces 
would better inform institutions and their regulators about the full landscape of potential risks. 
• We should decide a priori what should stay in 
the regulatory system and what shouldn’t. 
There are reasons for certain choices, and they 
should not be the accidental outcome of uncoordinated decision making. Regulatory arbitrage is 
already forcing many activities, from certain 
types of lending to certain types of trading, outside the banking system. Among many questions 
that need definitive answers, a few big ones 
would be: Do you want the mortgage business, 
credit and market making, along with other 
essential financial services, inside the banking 

UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY

system or outside of it? What would be the 
long-term effect of that choice? Under the new 
scheme, would nonbank credit-providing institutions be able to provide credit when their clients 
need them the most? I personally doubt that 
many of them could.
• We need banks to be attractive investments. 
It is in the interest of the financial system that 
banks not become “un-investable” because of 
uncertainty around regulations that affect capital, profitability and long-term investing. Erratic 
stress test capital requirements and constant 
uncertainty around future regulations damage 
the banking system without making it safer. 
While it is perfectly reasonable that a bank 
refrain from stock buybacks, dividends or 
growth under certain circumstances, it would be 
far better for the entire banking system if these 
rules were clearly enumerated (i.e., stipulate 
that a bank needs to reduce its buybacks and 
dividend if they breach certain thresholds). 
If done properly, banking regulations could be calibrated — adding virtually no additional risk — to 
make it easier for banks to make loans, intermediate markets, finance the economy, manage a run 
on their bank and fail if need be. When it comes to 
political debate about banking regulations, there is 
little truth to the notion that regulations have been 
“loosened,” at least in the context of large banks. 
(To the contrary, our capital requirements have 
been increasing for years, as shown on the chart 
on page 12.) The debate should not always be about 
more or less regulation but about what mix of 
regulations will keep America’s banking system 
the best in the world, such as capital and leverage 
ratios, liquidity and what counts as liquidity, resolution rules, deposit insurance, securitization, 
stress testing, proper usage of the discount window, tailoring and other requirements (including 
potential requirements on shadow banks). Because 
of the recent problems, we can add to this mix the 
review of concentrated customers, uninsured 
deposits and potential limitations on the use of 
HTM portfolios. Ideally, new rules and regulations 
would also make it easier for banks to provide 
credit in tougher times. 
ADJUSTING OUR STRATEGY TO THE NEW 
REGULATORY REALITY (BASEL III 
ENDGAME)
The Basel III Endgame (called Basel IV by some) — 
which, incredibly, has been nearly 10 years in the 
making — seems likely to increase, yet again, capital requirements for banks in general, through 
higher operational risk changes, and for trading 
and capital markets activity in particular, among 
other things. Whether or not we agree with all 
these changes (and we’ve discussed these regulations in detail in prior letters), we will simply have 
to adjust to them immediately. It’s important we 
describe to our shareholders how we will go about 
doing that and what it means for banks and, in 
particular, our bank.
First and foremost, banks must satisfy all of 
their regulators.
We must satisfy all of our regulators, and, remember, we have regulators all around the world, 
including more than 10 in the United States alone. 
Regulations include stress testing, reporting, compliance, legal obligations and trading surveillance, 
among others. While the business is the first line of 
defense on all these issues, we also have 3,700 
people in compliance, 7,100 in risk and 1,400 
lawyers actively working every day to meet the 
letter and the spirit of these rules along with the 
final line of defense — audit. 
Rules are constantly changing and/or being 
enhanced and are sometimes, unfortunately, 
driven by political motivations. Relationships with 
regulators can often be intense, and, recently, we 
have lost some terrific people in our firm because 
of this. Regulators know that when banks disagree, 
we essentially have no choice — there is no one to 
appeal to, and even the act of appealing can make 
them angry. We simply ask respectfully to be 
heard, but at the end of the day, we will do what 
they ask us to do.

UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY

Banks will play a smaller role in the global 
financial system. 
The chart above shows both the decreasing role 
and size of U.S. banks relative to the global economy alongside the increasing role and size of 
shadow banks. The data illustrates this dynamic. 
We expect this trend to continue for all the reasons 
I’ve discussed. 
Banks will continue to be guardians of the 
financial system.
Properly regulated banks are meant to protect and 
enhance the financial system. They are transparent with regulators, and they strive mightily to 
protect the system from terrorism financing and 
tax evasion as they implement know your customer guidelines and anti-money laundering laws. 
They protect clients’ assets and clients’ money in 
movement. Banks also help customers — from 
protecting their data and minimizing fraud and 
cyber risk to providing financial education — and 
must abide by social requirements, such as the 
Community Reinvestment Act, which requires 
banks to extend their services into lower-income 
communities. As mentioned previously, unlike the 
private market, banks do not always choose when 
to provide a product or service but need to be 
there for their clients when they need credit or 
liquidity the most. 
Looking forward, we constantly modify our 
strategies to adjust to our market realities.
It’s always best to adjust to new reality quickly. We 
really don’t like crying over spilled milk, although 
we sometimes do. The new reality is that some 
things — for example, holding certain types of 
credit — are more efficiently done by a nonbank.

Here are some actions we are taking to help our 
business succeed in the current and future 
environments:
1. First and foremost, we must conclude that holding certain types of credit, loans or otherwise 
has generally become less profitable because 
of the high levels of capital that need to be held 
against it — generally more than the market 
demands. What this means is that some credit 
is better held in a nonbank. Increasingly, for a 
credit relationship to make sense, banks need 
a lot of noncredit-related revenue. 
2. Because of various capital requirements, we try 
to reduce clients’ nonoperating cash deposits.
3. We are seeking to implement much tighter management and execution of business strategies. 
This includes repricing certain businesses, running off certain unprofitable products, changing 
the mix of business for a client, and more rigorously evaluating client selection and resource 
optimization applied to clients.
4. We are exploring new capital optimization 
strategies, which could include partnerships 
and perhaps one day more securitizations, 
among other opportunities. 
5. Unfortunately, it is becoming increasingly difficult for banks to stay in the mortgage business, 
which ultimately hurts everyday Americans. The 
high costs of origination and servicing along with 
the complexity of regulations create a costly 
business with significant legal, reputational and 
operational challenges. In addition, given capital 
requirements and the lack of a healthy securitization market, it barely makes sense for banks 
to hold mortgages or mortgage-servicing rights. 
Many banks have already reduced much of this 
business. We are hanging on, continuing to hope 
for meaningful change.
6. We have the ability to add low-capital or 
no-capital revenue streams, like providing valuable data and analytics in trading, travel and 
other relevant offers in the consumer bank, 
wealth management and payment services 
businesses, among others. 
If you review our CEO letters, you will see that we 
have many growth opportunities in front of us and 
our plans to attack them. We face the future and 
the new competition, large and small, with confidence, strength and a dash of humility.
KEEPING AN EYE ON ALL OF OUR 
COMPETITORS
The growing competition to banks from each other, 
as well as shadow banks, fintechs and large technology companies, is intense and clearly contributing to the diminishing role of banks and public 
companies in the United States and the global 
financial system. The pace of change and the size 
of the competition are extraordinary, and activity 
is accelerating. Walmart, for example (with over 
200 million in-store customers each week), can 
use new digital technologies to efficiently bring 
banking-type services to their customers. Apple, 
already a strong presence in banking-type services 
with Apple Pay and the Apple Card, is actively 
moving into other similar services such as payment 
processing, credit risk assessment, person-toperson payment systems, merchant acquiring and 
buy-now-pay-later offers. Large tech companies, 
already 100% digital, have hundreds of millions of 
customers, as well as enormous resources, in data 
and proprietary systems — all of which give them 
an extraordinary competitive advantage. 
We remain confident that as long as we stay 
vigilant, hungry, adaptable, fast and disciplined, 
we will continue to succeed in building this great 
company.

UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY

As recent countries and companies have demonstrated, great management and leadership are 
critical to any large organization’s long-term 
success. While providing strong management is a 
disciplined and rigorous process — facts, analysis, 
detail, rinse and repeat — creating an exceptional 
management team is an art, not a science.
In the rest of this section, I talk about some 
management lessons — I always enjoy sharing 
what I have learned over time by watching others 
and through my own successes and failures. 
BUILDING TRUE FRANCHISE VALUE
Accounting can distort actual economic 
reality.
I have spoken in the past about good and bad revenue and good and bad expenses. Certain expenses, 
such as opening well-designed and well-located 
branches, actually are long-term investments of 
great value. Conversely, poorly underwritten credit 
creates revenue that you are bound to regret. 
Further, there are accounting practices that may 
distort the true value of actions you take. For 
example, when we create a new credit card 
account, we recognize origination costs over 
12 months, but an average account exists for over 
eight years. And with the new accounting rules for 
loan loss reserves — called the current expected 
credit losses standard — you book the expected life 
of loan losses on the day you make the loan, while 
the revenue comes in over multiple years.
Increasingly in the modern world, many valuable 
things are not reflected on our balance sheet in 
generally accepted accounting principles — for 
example, previously expensed intellectual property or extraordinary human capital. At the end of 
the day, human capital is the most valuable asset. 
Think of a great athlete, a great lawyer or a great 
artist. It’s not simply the equipment — it’s the 
extraordinary training and talent of those 
involved, as we’ve also seen with the U.S. military. 
And sometimes it’s not the individual but the 
highly coordinated activities of the team that 
deliver the championship.
Finally, if any value is based upon models, one 
must really test the sensitivity of the outcome 
against changes in assumptions. Understanding 
the range of potential outcomes may be far more 
important than the point estimate created by a 
model. In some cases, you can have an excellent 
average outcome but with a chance of death.
The point is: Accounting can distort economic reality and can lead one to make the wrong decisions. 
Building true franchise value requires an 
outcomes-based outlook.
In banking, specific examples illustrate how merely 
following accounting and capital rules — without 
thinking through the outcomes— can lead one 
astray. I’m going to describe just two examples, 
but there are hundreds more. 
If you buy or create a loan at par and put it on your 
balance sheet at par (think of a mortgage) and 
internally finance it, even match-funded with 10% 
capital, you might believe you have a 12% return. 
Many companies subscribe to this interpretation 
and simply continue to borrow money to invest in 
such a thing. But I would tell you this product has 
Management Lessons 

MANAGEMENT LESSONS

no franchise value because it is only worth par, 
and, in fact, a small change in that value (because 
of interest rates and credit spread) could mean 
that you have made a huge mistake. If, on the 
other hand, you create a loan and sell it at more 
than par at a profit, you have created value — 
whether or not you keep it on your balance sheet. 
And far more important, if you create a loan and at 
the same time forge a client relationship — and you 
add additional capital-light revenue, such as asset 
management and cash management — you have 
created something of long-term value that you can 
nurture and grow. This is franchise value.
Simply taking interest rate risk (which contributed 
to the downfall of SVB) is not a business. Nor is 
simply taking credit risk. One person and a computer will suffice — you do not need 290,000 
people circling the globe to do that. 
Another example relates to any branch-based 
business. Let’s say I build a system with welldesigned and well-located branches, staffed by 
well-trained personnel who can offer customers 
great products and services and who strive to do 
every task a little bit better. Then you build a 
branch system with outdated sites in poor locations (often to save money) that have undertrained 
and underpaid staff and lower-quality products 
and services. Between the two, my branch system 
will win every time. One system will have high 
franchise value and be self-perpetuating with high 
returns. The other enterprise is probably on the 
road to eventual failure. If you study the history 
of business, you can see this phenomenon play 
out in grocery stores, car companies, restaurants, 
retailers and various other enterprises. 
LEARNING FROM INVESTOR DAY 
In February 2021, we did not hold our annual Investor Day for the obvious reason — COVID-19. When 
February 2022 came around, we were somewhat 
happy to be relieved of that responsibility again. 
Investor Day is a tremendous amount of work. But 
from 2020 to 2022, we did a lot of investment 
spending and made several acquisitions. Some of 
our analysts questioned whether we were being 
transparent enough in terms of what we were doing 
and why we were doing it. While sometimes we get 
frustrated with investor demands — and not all 
investors are created equally — all investors should 
be treated fairly and with respect. So, in 2022, we 
gave it more thought and reversed course with an 
extensive Investor Day. Our senior management 
team explained in detail our acquisitions and our 
investments, answering every question to the best 
of their ability. Having to explain your business to 
investors, comparing yourself with competitors and 
looking at the business as a whole — across sales, 
marketing, returns, growth, risks and strategic 
opportunities — was a terrific exercise for us. 
We learned our lesson!
This also raises another issue. Of course, it is critically important to analyze your business at the 
right disaggregated level — right down to the 
branch — inside the company. But it is also important to have the proper segments reported externally to the company, properly accounted for and 
generally aligned to their relevant competitors. 
This actually helps hold managers accountable by 
forcing them to accurately assess performance — 
the good, the bad and the ugly — without any 
attempts to avoid reality through an external 
obfuscation of results. 

MANAGEMENT LESSONS

BALANCING A CUSTOMER-CENTRIC 
APPROACH WITH (EXCESSIVE) RISK
Most businesses, including banks like us, say they 
put their customers first. We often go further than 
that statement to say that we need to be there for 
them, in good times and in bad. However, banking 
is a complex industry, and this customer-centric 
approach requires a little more explanation. 
In our business, we are essentially a financial 
partner to a client. While we strive to build great 
client relationships based on trust over the long 
run, our role has intricacies. For example, we do 
not need every transaction to make economic 
sense — just the overall client relationship, year 
after year. Whatever the transaction, we need to 
be properly compensated for the risks we bear, 
which can be extraordinary. Very often, a client 
will merely look for the lowest price, which we 
completely understand; we recognize that sometimes banks are perfectly willing to make a certain transaction for a client at a loss. There are 
also occasions when we need to tell a client that a 
specific financial transaction would be imprudent 
— maybe for us and the client. 
Say, for example, that a very strong client of ours 
is simply trying to get the best price for a leveraged loan. If we believe the desired price is unwise 
and another institution is willing to offer it, we will 
advise the client to take that option. For us, this is 
pure counterparty risk and not really part of our 
core relationship. Conversely, should the same 
client come to us and request something that 
extends beyond what we consider reasonable 
for that transaction, we may nonetheless do it. 
Perhaps the client is in the middle of an M&A 
transaction in difficult markets and simply cannot 
get the financing they need — other than from us. 
In recent crises, we have often gone the extra 
mile for a client at great risks to ourselves, not 
to make a profit but to rescue the client from 
financial calamity.
Fundamentally, putting the client first means 
always providing them with the products and services they need (although they may go somewhere 
else because of price) and having our whole team 
work hard for them — either in the United States or 
around the world, reliably and with constancy. One 
of the most important things we do for a client, 
above all else, is to be a steady hand, providing 
financial safety and security at every turn.

Some Commonsense Principles 
for Corporate Governance
I have written before about the diminishing role of 
public companies in the American financial system. 
They peaked in 1996 at 7,300 and now total 4,600. 
Conversely, the number of private U.S. companies 
backed by private equity firms has grown from 
1,900 to 11,200 over the last two decades. And this 
does not include the increasing number of companies owned by sovereign wealth funds and family 
offices. This migration is serious and worthy of 
critical study, and it may very well increase with 
more regulation and litigation coming. We really 
need to consider: Is this the outcome we want? 
There are good reasons for such healthy private 
markets, and some good outcomes have resulted 
from them as well. The reasons are complex 
and may include public market factors such as 
onerous reporting requirements, higher litigation 
expenses, costly regulations, cookie-cutter board 
governance, less compensation flexibility, heightened public scrutiny and the relentless pressure 
of quarterly earnings. 
With intensified public reporting, investors’ growing needs for environmental, social and governance information and the universal proxy — which 
makes it very easy to put disruptive directors on a 
board — the pressure to become a private company will rise. Corporate governance principles are 
becoming more and more templated and formulaic, which is a negative trend. For example, sometimes proxy advisors automatically judge board 
members unfavorably if they have been on the 
board a long time, without a fair assessment of 
their actual contributions or experience. And some 
simple, sensible governance principles are far better than the formulaic ones. The governance of 
major corporations is evolving into a bureaucratic 
compliance exercise instead of focusing on its relationship to long-term economic value. Good corporate governance is critical, and a little common 
sense would go a long way.
PROMOTING OPEN COMMUNICATION AND 
TRUST WITH THE BOARD 
As authorized and coordinated by the board, directors should have unfettered access to management, including those below the CEO’s direct 
reports. At every board meeting, to ensure open 
and free discussion, the full board should meet in 
executive session without the CEO or other members of management. The independent directors 
should ensure that they have enough time to do 
this properly.
This one act would allow the board to have a completely open conversation and provide candid 
feedback to the CEO and management team. Good 
CEOs, who are trying to do the best job they can, 
should appreciate this important feedback — and 
should know how difficult it is to gather in a large 
group. This type of quality discussion among and 
with board members leads to collaboration and 
good succession planning since every meeting 
should include a real conversation around this 
important topic. Meetings such as these allow 
the board to nurture the extraordinary value of 
collaboration and trust. 
CONFRONTING SUCCESSION PLANNING
Our board is responsible for succession planning, 
and it is on the agenda every time board members 
meet — both when they are with me and when I am 
not in the room. We already have a “hit-by-thetruck” plan ready to go (not all companies can say 
this), and we have multiple successor candidates 
who are well-known to the board and to the investor community. The board believes this is one of its 
paramount priorities. You can rest assured that 
our board members are on the case and are very 
comfortable with where we are. 

SOME COMMONSENSE PRINCIPLES FOR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT WITH ASSET 
MANAGERS 
We — companies and investors — need to become 
more active and involved in proxy issues each 
year to foster better communication between the 
investors and the board of the companies they 
own. Whether it’s issues around climate risk or 
say on pay, it should be appropriate for the management team or board to actively engage with 
investors during proxy season to hear and understand each other’s views on key issues and communicate their positions in real time. Investors 
should also require proxy advisors to share any 
communications they have with a company in real 
time before investors make voting decisions. In 
my view, too many portfolio managers and investors have partially ceded critical decisions on key 
proxy issues to their internal stewardship groups 
or external proxy advisors. Stewardship teams 
are also often under pressure to follow proxy 
advisors by bureaucratic internal systems at 
investment firms that discourage disagreement 
and encourage the safety of the herd. Many portfolio managers have told me that even when they 
have the authority to override the internal group, 
it is frequently very difficult to do so. 
The new universal proxy is likely to create 
havoc for companies.
The new universal proxy makes it such that one 
investor with one share, who owns it for as little 
as one day, can nominate a director for any reason, at relatively low cost. In my view, it is likely 
that not just activists but also special interest 
groups will nominate directors. Not only would 
this be extremely disruptive to the board, but, 
almost by their nature, special interest groups 
would be counter to shareholders’ interests. While 
we fully respect being transparent — protecting 
investors and shareholder rights — director election processes are becoming too far removed 
from shareholder interests. 
While there are legitimate complaints against 
entrenched boards, good boards often tend to 
interview prospective candidates for their brains, 
integrity, work ethic, management and collaboration skills, and experience. With this new universal 
proxy, it’s easy to envision a time when a proxy 
season will be like a political campaign, with interest groups on both sides of an issue trying to elect 
a board member. Disruptive boards, which can be 
caused by just a single troublesome member, are 
an anathema to shareholders’ interests. This is 
unlikely to end well. 

SOME COMMONSENSE PRINCIPLES FOR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

We usually don’t worry about typical economic 
fluctuations and often compare economic forecasting with weather forecasting: It is extremely complicated, easy to do in the short term and far more 
difficult to do in the long run. It is particularly hard 
to forecast true longer-term inflection points in the 
economy. Although we don’t want to waste time on 
“normal” fluctuations, we do want to be prepared 
for economic extremes — we look at multiple possibilities and probabilities and manage our company so that we can handle all of them, whether or 
not we think they actually will happen. After we 
spoke last year about storm clouds, some of those 
storms did indeed hit, and, unfortunately, some of 
those threatening clouds are still here. 
2022 was not normal, economically speaking, and, 
in fact, 2022 witnessed several dramatic events — 
the Ukraine war began; inflation hit a 40-year high 
of 9%; the federal funds rate experienced one of 
its most rapid increases, up 425 basis points, 
albeit from a low level; stock markets were down 
20%; unemployment fell to a 50-year low at 3.5%; 
and the U.S. economy was bolstered by frequent 
fiscal stimulus and by high and rising government 
debt while supply chain issues eased. In addition, 
work from home began to raise commercial real 
estate challenges, and, finally, long- and shortterm interest rates presented a sharply inverted 
yield curve, which is “eight for eight” in terms of 
predicting a recession (more on this later). But, 
surprisingly, the global economy marched ahead. 
THE CURRENT ECONOMY: PRETTY GOOD 
BUT STORM CLOUDS AHEAD
Until the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, the current economy was performing adequately, both 
here in the United States and remarkably better 
than anyone expected in Europe. The “market” 
was generally forecasting either a soft landing or a 
mild recession, with interest rates peaking at 5% 
and then slowly coming down.
There has been a lot of market volatility over the 
past year, partially, in my opinion, as people 
over-extrapolate monthly data, which is highly distorted by inflation, supply chain adjustments, consumer substitution, basically poor assumptions 
about housing costs and other factors. But underlying all this, consumers have been spending 7% to 
9% more than in the prior year and 23% more 
than pre-COVID-19. Similarly, their balance sheets 
are in great shape as they still have, according to 
our own analysis, $1.2 trillion more “excess cash” 
in their checking accounts than before the pandemic (credit card debt is simply normalizing). 
In addition, unemployment is extremely low, and 
wages are going up, particularly at the low end. 
We’ve had 10 years of home and stock price appreciation, and even if we go into a recession, consumers would enter it in far better shape than 
during the great financial crisis. Finally, supply 
chains are recovering, businesses are pretty 
healthy and credit losses are extremely low. 
The failures of SVB and Credit Suisse have significantly changed the market’s expectations, bond 
prices have recovered dramatically, the stock market is down and the market’s odds of a recession 
have increased. And while this is nothing like 2008, 
it is not clear when this current crisis will end. It 
has provoked lots of jitters in the market and will 
clearly cause some tightening of financial conditions as banks and other lenders become more 
conservative. However, it is unclear whether this 
disruption is likely to slow consumer spending (as 
of April 1, 2023, spending has been consistently 
running higher versus the prior year). Although 
higher rates, particularly in mortgages, have 
reduced both home sales and prices, do remember 
that consumer spending drives more than 65% of 
the U.S. economy. 
Evaluating and Managing 
the Economic and Geopolitical 
Risks Ahead 

EVALUATING AND MANAGING THE ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL RISKS AHEAD

While the current crisis has exposed some weaknesses in the system, it should not be considered, 
as I pointed out, anything like what we experienced 
in 2008. Nonetheless, we do have other unique 
and complicated issues in front of us, which are 
outlined in the chart above. 
POTENTIAL TROUBLE BREWING FROM 
UNPRECEDENTED FISCAL SPENDING, 
QUANTITATIVE TIGHTENING AND 
GEOPOLITICAL TENSIONS
Having already confessed to how difficult it is to 
predict the future, for planning purposes it still 
makes sense to try to assess the environment 
ahead by laying out those factors that may be 
significantly different from the past. 
Fiscal stimulus is still surging through the 
system.
In the last three years, partially but not entirely 
due to the pandemic, the federal government had 
a deficit of $3.1 trillion (2020), $2.8 trillion (2021) 
and $1.4 trillion (2022). These are extraordinary 
numbers, which ended up in consumers’ pockets, 
in states and local municipalities, and even in companies. We pointed out last year that you simply 
cannot have this level of spending and say that it’s 
not inflationary. It’s also important to point out 
that there is a multiplier effect of this stimulus; 
that is, one person’s spending is another person’s 
income and so on. The deficit for the next three 
years is now estimated to be $1.4 trillion to $1.8 
trillion per year, which is also an extraordinary 
number, with no end in sight. In Europe, fiscal deficits are high — even before the enormous subsidies 
given to consumers to counterbalance higher 
energy prices. It’s also important to note that 
borrowing to invest is fundamentally different 
from borrowing to consume — borrowing to consume can only be inflationary.
This is before any additional costs related to future 
recessions, the war or any other unforeseeable 
events. Offsetting this, by sometime late this year 
or early next year, we expect consumers will have 
spent the bulk of their remaining excess savings. It 
remains to be seen whether this will cause a little 
bit of a cliff effect or whether consumer spending 
will simply slow down. Either way, this will add to 
whatever recessionary pressures there are sometime in the future. 
Today’s quantitative tightening is following 
more than a decade of quantitative easing.
In the two years after COVID-19, the Fed bought 
$4.5 trillion of U.S. Treasuries and mortgagebacked securities, bringing its total balance sheet 
to $9 trillion. We have experienced almost 12 
years of quantitative easing (QE), which drove 
interest rates down — so much so that U.S. shortterm rates were virtually zero, and the 10-year 
bond hit a low of 0.5%. Amazingly, tens of trillions 
of dollars of debt, mostly in Europe, sold at negative 
interest rates (we will look back upon this with 
total astonishment). This period of QE also led 
to extraordinary liquidity (and a surging money

supply) that undoubtedly drove increased prices 
across many investment classes — from stocks 
and bonds to crypto, meme stocks and real estate, 
among others. Importantly, this also increased 
bank deposits from $13 trillion to $18 trillion 
(and the now-famous uninsured deposits from 
$6 trillion to $8 trillion). 
QE is now being reversed into quantitative tightening (QT) as the Fed grapples with inflation. So far, 
the Fed has reduced its securities holdings by 
approximately $550 billion and is committed to 
reducing its holdings by almost $100 billion in 
securities each month or over $1 trillion each year. 
How all this will unfold is still unknown as the 
direction and speed of money have changed significantly from prior years. To varying degrees, 
banks will compete for money, not only among one 
another but also with money market funds, other 
investments and the Fed itself. Money market fund 
total assets under management have increased 
by $650 billion since April 2022, with a significant 
portion migrating into the Fed’s reverse repo facility, thereby draining deposits from the banking 
system. So while the Fed’s balance sheet has come 
down by approximately $550 billion, deposits at 
the banks have come down by $1 trillion, largely 
uninsured deposits. Unfortunately, some banks 
invested much of these excess deposits in “safe” 
Treasuries, which, of course, went down in value as 
rates rose faster than most people expected. 
It should be noted that an inordinate amount of 
attention is focused on short-term interest rates, 
which the Fed affects directly. But the Fed does 
not completely control long-term rates and liquidity, which are influenced by both supply and 
demand (QT) and global investor preferences and 
sentiment — importantly, including views on risk 
and safety. It is also important to remember that 
while the central banks of the world are now selling instead of buying securities, the governments 
of the world have larger debts to finance. The 
United States alone needs to sell $2 trillion in 
securities, which must be absorbed in the market. 
This turn of events is generally true globally.
There has been huge intervention by central banks 
around the world over the last decade. While it was 
completely necessary in 2008 and 2009 to stop 
the worst of the global financial crisis, and again in 
2020 to stop the effects of the global pandemic, 
the depth and breadth of these interventions will 
be studied for years as will the extent to which we 
need QT (whose full effect may not be known 
immediately). It is unclear how the Fed incorporated the enormous fiscal spending into both its 
forecasts for growth and inflation, as well as its 
need to continue QE as it did. And importantly, the 
Fed’s ability to reverse course on this strategy (QT) 
is somewhat constrained by higher inflation 
(though, of course, it can temporarily adjust its 
actions to deal with the current bank failure crisis). 
War complicates geopolitics and materially 
adds risks.
We have not had a major land war in Europe since 
1945. The war in Ukraine, already into its second 
year, has been particularly devastating in terms of 
casualties and damage and has been haunted by 
the threat of nuclear weapons. It may very well 
last for many more years. Wars are unpredictable, 
and at the start, most predictions about how they 
will end have been completely wrong. 
This war is also affecting global energy and food 
supplies, with a disproportionate and negative 
effect falling on poor people and poorer nations, 
including millions of Ukrainian refugees. There is 
still a risk that energy and food supply lines, which 
are not secure, will lead to higher prices and the 
large migration of people, triggering another level 
of geopolitical dislocation. 
The tensions of this war are also leading to the 
rethinking of many economic alliances, as well 
as trade and national security. All these factors 
create more risk and potentially higher inflation, 
and their confluence (along with inflation and QT) 
creates a somewhat unpredictable and dangerous 
outcome. 
This may be a once-in-a-generation sea 
change, with material effect.
Of course, there is always uncertainty. I am often 
frustrated when people talk about today’s uncertainty as if it were any different from yesterday’s 
uncertainty. However, in this case, I believe it 
actually is. 

EVALUATING AND MANAGING THE ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL RISKS AHEAD

Less predictable geopolitics, in general, and a 
complex adjustment to relationships with China 
are probably leading to higher military spending 
and a realignment of global economic and military 
alliances.
Higher fiscal spending, higher debt to gross 
domestic product (GDP), higher investment spend 
in general (including climate spending), higher 
energy costs and the inflationary effect of trade 
adjustments all lead me to believe that we may 
have gone from a savings glut to scarce capital 
and may be headed to higher inflation and higher 
interest rates than in the immediate past. 
Essentially, we may be moving, as I read somewhere, from a virtuous cycle to a vicious cycle. 
PREPARING FOR WHAT MAY BE A NEW 
AND UNCERTAIN FUTURE
Of course, we hope that everything turns out okay 
and that all of these storm clouds peacefully and 
painlessly dissipate – and we need to be prepared 
for that outcome. We also need to be prepared for 
a new and uncertain future. The new risks (in 
addition to the normal ones, like recession) are 
higher inflation for longer, the market effects of 
QT and growing political risks. Of course, I cannot 
be sure this will happen, but I place higher odds 
on it than the “market.”
Managing risks is far more than simply 
meeting the Fed’s annual stress test. 
While it is critical that we meet and pass the Fed’s 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) 
stress test, managing risk is far more than that – 
and we are fairly fanatical when it comes to managing risk. Our company does hundreds of stress tests 
a week, which include market movements reflective 
of many past crises (such as volatility resulting 
from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the pandemic 
in 2020) and rapidly rising interest rates. 
The Fed’s CCAR stress test, by its nature, has fairly 
arbitrary results since it uses only one different 
and hypothetical scenario each year. This creates 
uncertainty around our capital requirements (as I 
mentioned, this may damage the value of bank 
stocks and the banking system). If I were a shareholder, I would want to know if my company would 
really lose the $44 billion after taxes (over a 
nine-quarter period) that the stress test shows. 
And the answer is absolutely not.
While I understand why regulators stress test this 
way — they are essentially trying to ensure that 
banks survive the worst-case scenario (which 
assumes multiple problems at a struggling bank 
without any benefit from good management or 
rapid response) — the methodology clearly does 
not result in an accurate forecast of how our company would perform under adverse circumstances. 
I have very little doubt that if the severely adverse 
scenario played out, JPMorgan Chase would perform far better than the stress test projections. 
I believe we would actually make money over the 
nine quarters in the Fed’s stress scenario.
Here’s one example that illustrates this. From 
March 5 to March 20, 2020, when the stock market 
fell 24% and the bond index spread gapped from 
191 to 446 basis points prior to major Fed intervention, our actual trading revenue was higher 
than normal as we actively made markets for our 
clients. By contrast, the hypothetical stress test 
had us losing a huge amount of money in market 
making, based on the way it is calculated. One 
more thing to point out: JPMorgan Chase now has 
enough total loss-absorbing capacity to bear out 
peak CCAR losses (using the Fed’s numbers) more 
than eight times over. 
In addition to CCAR testing, we stress test for various types of huge market disruptions. For example, we stress counterparties — such as hedge 
funds, large asset managers or trading houses — 
for extremely large market moves, perhaps an 
instantaneous 130 basis point move in Treasuries 
or 50% to 60% moves in commodities. Our shareholders should know that regarding any major 
international bank, we remain well-collateralized 
across all of our exposures. Even if one of those 
banks went bankrupt overnight, we would be okay. 
While there is always a risk that we won’t receive a 
margin call or that some trades may default and 
leave us exposed to large market risk, the losses 
likely would not be material.
Suffice it to say, our company prepares not only for 
various forms of extreme economic risk but for 
various forms of geopolitical risk. Later in this letter 
I describe how we have enhanced those efforts. 

EVALUATING AND MANAGING THE ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL RISKS AHEAD

Don’t underestimate the extreme importance 
of interest rates.
Interest rates are extraordinarily important — they 
are the cosmological constant, or the mathematical certainty, that affects all things economic. 
Before I comment on that, I want to share some 
astounding numbers to illustrate this point:
When you analyze a stock, you look at many factors: 
earnings, cash flow, competition, margins, scenarios, consumer preferences, new technologies and 
so on. But the math above is immovable and 
affects all. 
In a rapidly rising rate environment, any investment where the cash flows were expected in the 
out years would have been dramatically affected — 
think venture capital or real estate development, 
for example. Any form of carry trade (effectively 
borrowing short and investing long) would be 
sorely disappointed. Carry trade exists not just in 
banks but is embedded and is silently present in 
companies, investment vehicles and others, including situations that require recurring refinancing. 
We are prepared for potentially higher interest 
rates, and we may have higher inflation for 
longer. 
If we have higher inflation for longer, the Fed may 
be forced to increase rates higher than people 
expect despite the recent bank crisis. Also, QT may 
have ongoing impacts that might, over time, be 
another force, pushing longer-term rates higher 
than currently envisioned. This may occur even if 
we have a mild — or not-so-mild — recession, as we 
saw in the 1970s and 1980s. 
Today’s inverted yield curve implies that we are 
going into a recession. As someone once said, an 
inverted yield curve like this is “eight for eight” 
in predicting a recession in the next 12 months. 
However, it may not be true this time because of 
the enormous effect of QT. As previously stated, 
longer-term rates are not necessarily controlled 
by central banks, and it is possible that the inversion we see today is still driven by prior QE and 
not the dramatic change in supply and demand 
that is going to take place in the future. 
We have always looked at the “fat tails” of higher 
interest rates, particularly on our own company. 
We were premature in thinking about the possibility of interest rates going to 5%, 6% or 7% — which 
still might not happen, but we always want to be 
protected against this outcome. For example, we 
have spoken about stockpiling cash, not investing 
in sovereign debt when rates were low and being 
willing to forgo income to protect against rising 
rates. Rest assured, our company can handle 
significantly higher interest rates no matter how 
anyone analyzes capital. 
Higher interest rates will obviously have an 
important impact, not just for banks but for some 
of those who borrow on a floating rate or those 
who have to refinance in a higher rate environment. If this tide goes out, you should assume that 
it will expose additional weaknesses in the economy. However, our company is prepared — not only 
for higher rates but for a potential recession that 
could arise and related credit losses. That preparation includes analyzing all of our clients (in particular our leveraged lending, real estate and other clients) for what the impact of higher rates may 
mean for them. We believe the risks within our 
own portfolio are manageable. And we try to analyze the impact of these factors on companies and 
industries away from us. For example, we do 
expect that some types of real estate in certain 
locations may come under pressure. 
Finally, we assume all of these risks and uncertainties will result in volatile markets.

There are risks and opportunities in the 
restructuring of global economic relations.
There is no question that supply chains need to be 
restructured for three different reasons:
• For any products or materials that are essential 
for national security (think rare earths, 5G and 
semiconductors), the U.S. supply chain must be 
domestic or only open to completely friendly 
allies or partners. We cannot and should not 
ever be reliant on processes that can and will be 
used against us, especially when we are most 
vulnerable. All countries will be protecting their 
national security in their own way, tailoring their 
strategies as they see fit. 
• Countries will also be taking specific action to 
protect critical industries (think electric vehicles 
(EV), AI and chips) that may not be directly 
related to national security but are key to 
national competitiveness. This is essentially 
what America’s IRA is meant to do. 
• Companies will diversify their supply chains 
simply to be more resilient. 
This restructuring will likely take place over time 
and does not need to be excessively disruptive. 
There will be winners and losers — some of the 
main beneficiaries will be Brazil, Canada, Mexico 
and friendly Southeast Asian nations.
For similar national security reasons, activities — 
including investment activities — that help create a 
national security risk (e.g., sharing critical technology with potential adversaries) should be restricted.
While focusing on the risks, it’s also important 
not to forget the opportunities. The transition to 
a green economy will eventually require $4 trillion 
a year in capital expenditures. The IRA, CHIPS Act 
and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law combined will 
create huge opportunities for companies, investors 
and entrepreneurs across virtually every industry 
group in the United States. You can rest assured 
that our company is organizing to help clients 
make the most of these opportunities. 
Along with reconfiguring our supply chains, we 
must create new trading systems with our allies. 
My preference would be to rejoin the Trans-Pacific 
Partnership — it is the best geostrategic trade 
arrangement possible with allied nations. You can 
be certain that our company is closely monitoring 
and adjusting to the risks and opportunities created by current events. 
Believe it or not, inflation and interest rates are 
not the things that worry me the most. I’m most 
concerned about large geopolitical events, cyber 
attacks, nuclear proliferation, large dysfunctional 
markets (partially due to poorly calibrated regulations; e.g., the U.K. Gilt and U.S. Treasury markets) 
and failure of other critical infrastructure.
We have established a new Security Forum.
The war in Ukraine has exposed the severity, complexity and interconnectivity of threats such as 
physical security, the loss of nonbank critical infrastructure (i.e., communication networks), pandemics, insider threats, trade relations, political risk, 
sanctions, data privacy, war, and the impact of 
regulatory and governmental actions. All these 
factors affect our company, as well as our clients 
and countries and their governments. You should 
know that we have formed a new Security Forum, 
which meets periodically and enables management to continually assess the impact of ongoing 
threats to our company, our clients and countries 
around the globe. These risks — which include market risk, credit risk, cyber risk and operational risk, 
among others — are also covered at the board level 
by our Risk Committee.
Finally, when one talks about risk for too long, it 
begins to cloud your judgment. Looking ahead, the 
positives are huge. However events play out, it is 
likely that 20 years from now, America’s GDP will be 
more than twice the size it is today, and hundreds of 
millions of people around the world will have been 
lifted out of poverty. In the next section, I talk more 
about the need for a global economic strategy. 

EVALUATING AND MANAGING THE ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL RISKS AHEAD

Like most Americans, I get frustrated with the 
mediocrity and bureaucracy of the massive administrative state. We accept it too readily. And it damages the confidence we have in our own country. 
I have enormous respect for the people who work 
for the U.S. government, but we simply don’t invest 
enough in making it more effective. Some examples 
are: antiquated systems at the Federal Aviation 
Administration, United States Postal Service and 
Internal Revenue Service; inefficient ports and 
crumbling infrastructure; an ineffective immigration policy; policies that prevent affordable housing 
and leave apartments vacant; policies that hurt 
Puerto Rico; tenure versus merit-based compensation and promotion; and work rules that dramatically reduce efficiency. We have a vast system with 
a lack of accountability and proper reporting. And 
usually when reports are issued, they only address 
how much money was spent — not, for example, 
how many highway miles were built, in what time 
period and at what cost. Government, which is 20% 
of the economy, seems to be getting less productive over time, unlike the rest of the economy. In 
addition, we have too much litigation — this is the 
bureaucratization of America — think Europe. 
To be completely fair, I am also frustrated with the 
typically shortsighted selfishness of some businesses, asking for abundant special tax breaks and 
often using regulations to protect the incumbent. I 
also want to express exasperation with some of my 
fellow citizens who don’t pay the taxes they owe on 
the order of $600 billion a year, who won’t consider sensible policy measures like a carbon tax to 
stem climate change and who sometimes seem to 
only like democracy when the voters agree with 
them. Democracy by its nature is compromise. One 
of the lessons of the past decade is that if major 
legislation cannot be done in a bipartisan way, 
maybe it should not be done at all. 
DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE POLICY AND 
EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT
Theology is not policy. Policy based on falsehood 
or oversimplified facts is doomed to failure. Too 
often now, policy starts as politics without the 
benefit of analytics and experts. 
Policy should precede politics — not the other 
way around.
Policy should be painstakingly developed based on 
facts and analysis (and on information about how 
policies were productively developed in other 
parts of the world). You can effectively crowdsource policy expertise. Why were Germany and 
Switzerland so successful with apprenticeship programs? Why were Canada and Singapore so effective with permitting and infrastructure? All policies, like education, infrastructure and regulation, 
need to start with an agreed-upon goal — and be 
comprehensive and coordinated to accomplish it. 
After the core of a policy is developed, then, of 
course, it will be modified by political leaders — but 
it is hoped the core of the policy remains intact. If 
those modifications bastardize it in such a way as to 
render it inefficient, it should be dropped. 
We require a 21st century government.
In a company, you are constantly setting up your 
organization for success. We need to find a way to 
more rapidly reorganize our government for the 
new world. While Congress can often move very 
quickly in a crisis, we are unable to move quickly 
as a government over the medium term. We need 
to move faster, adopt new technologies and retrain 
human capital more quickly. Even in a good 
company, reorganizing for change can be hard — 
business and staff units fight to maintain their 
status quo and perceived prerogatives as if their 
lives were at stake. I can only imagine how hard 
this is in the government, but it will only get worse 
if we do not fix this in our fast-changing world.
Our Serious Need for More 
Effective Public Policy 
and Competent Government

OUR SERIOUS NEED FOR MORE EFFECTIVE PUBLIC POLICY AND COMPETENT GOVERNMENT

By Jamie Dimon
ussia’s invasion of Ukraine punctured many assumptions about the 
future of the world and thus was a 
pivotal moment in history. America and the 
West can no longer maintain a false sense 
of security based on the illusion that dictatorships and oppressive nations won’t use 
their economic and military powers to 
advance their aims—particularly against 
what they perceive as weak, incompetent 
and disorganized Western democracies. In 
a troubled world, we are reminded that 
national security is and always will be 
paramount, even if it seems to recede in 
tranquil times.
It should also lay to rest the idea that 
America can stand alone. U.S. leaders must 
always put America first, but global peace 
and order is a vital American interest. Only 
America has the full capability to lead and 
coalesce the Western world, though we 
must do so respectfully and in partnership 
with our allies. Without cohesiveness and 
unity with our allies, autocratic forces will 
divide and conquer the bickering West. 
America needs to lead with its strengths—
not only military but also economic, diplomatic and moral. Here’s what we can do:
• Rededicate ourselves to the qualities 
and principles that made America great. 
These principles are life, liberty, the pursuit 
of happiness and the idea that all people 
are created equal. Democracy and human 
freedom are inseparable from freedom of 
speech, freedom of religion and free enterprise. It would help to educate all Americans 
about the sacrifice of those who came before 
us for democracy at home and abroad.
We need to acknowledge the critical role 
that government plays—and we need 
government to be more competent and 
accountable. We must build stronger safety 
nets to care for the poor, the old and the 
disabled, and to cushion adjustment to 
economic change, while also maintaining 
economic dynamism, individual responsibility and the dignity of work. We must 
confront crises and failures of public policy 
by developing better policies and by 
dealing with realities. We can recognize 
the mistakes America has made without 
disparaging the nation. 
We support global human rights and 
stand on the side of liberty, but we also 
have to be realistic about the compromises 
necessary to accomplish long-term goals. 
Remember Franklin D. Roosevelt and 
Winston Churchill allied with Stalin against 
Hitler’s imminent threat.
• Develop a Marshall Plan for global 
energy and food security. This will be 
critical both in keeping the Western 
alliances together and minimizing the 
global suffering caused by starvation. 
Global energy and food supply chains are 
precarious by their nature. And it should 
be self-evident that energy security and 
preventing climate change aren’t contradictory: Secure and reliable oil and gas 
production is compatible with reducing 
CO2 over the long run, and is far better 
than burning more coal. It should also 
be self-evident that global food and energy 
security relies on realistic trade policy and 
American military strength.
• Increase military spending, along 
with our allies, as much as necessary to 
protect the world. Not only is America a 
bastion of freedom; it is still the arsenal of 
democracy, and economic sanctions are no 
substitute for an effective military. “We 
know only too well that war comes not 
when the forces of freedom are strong, but 
when they are weak,” as Ronald Reagan 
said in 1980. Military strength needs to 
be combined and coordinated with strong 
diplomatic and economic aid for the developing world. Thoughtful policies would 
help many nations lift up their people, 
develop their human rights and join economic unions that are good for all involved.
• Recover our economic dynamism. A 
strong economy is the foundation for 
American power, and we haven’t focused 
enough on economic growth. Between 
2000 and 2020, real U.S. GDP grew at an 
average rate of only 1.7% a year. Had 
we grown at 3% instead, last year’s gross 
domestic product per person would have 
been $15,000 higher. That would help pay 
for much of what we need to do as a nation. 
Economic growth will repair the fraying 
of the American dream, particularly if we 
share the wealth by improving education 
and wages for lower-paid citizens. There 
are many effective ways to do this, such as 
raising minimum wages and expanding the 
earned-income tax credit. We must also fix 
the immigration policies that are tearing us 
apart, dramatically reducing illegal immigration and dramatically increasing legal 
immigration. Economic growth will reduce 
inflation, reduce the deficit, and make it 
easier to afford the strong military we need. 
We aren’t going to have the economic 
growth we need with the legal, regulatory 
and bureaucratic system we have today.
Global trade will necessarily be restructured so that we don’t rely on potential 
adversaries for critical goods and services. 
This will require more “industrial planning” than America is used to—and we 
must ensure it is properly done and is not 
used for political purposes. Yet America 
should also open its arms, through trade 
and aid, to all other nations. Most developing countries would prefer to align economically with the West if we help them 
solve their problems. We should develop a 
new strategic and economic framework to 
make ourselves their partner of choice.
• Deal with China thoughtfully and 
without fear. America still has an enormously strong hand—plenty of food, water 
and energy; peaceful neighbors; and what 
is still the most prosperous and dynamic 
economy the world has ever seen, with a 
per person GDP of over $75,000 a year. 
We can have faith that our system will 
maintain the economic dynamism we need. 
China has done a great job lifting up its 
nation and bringing its GDP per person up 
to $13,000 a year. Yet any fair assessment 
must recognize its challenges—not enough 
food, water and energy; a very complex 
geopolitical situation with tough neighbors; 
a lack of freedom that creates economic 
rigidity and malinvestment.
Whether you think it is a competitor or a 
potential adversary, we, along with our 
allies, should firmly negotiate with China 
(where my company and its predecessor 
firms have done business for more than a 
century). We should acknowledge that we 
have common interests in combating 
nuclear proliferation, climate change and 
terrorism. Tough but thoughtful negotiations over strategic, military and economic 
concerns—including unfair competition—
should yield a better situation for all. If 
America leads well, China will be better 
off forming partnerships with a strong 
Western world than with Russia, Iran and 
other such nations.
Together, we can ensure America’s leadership for the next 100 years.

The West Needs America’s Leadership
How the U.S. can marshal its strengths—not only military but also moral, economic and diplomatic
Originally published in The Wall Street Journal on January 3, 2023. Reprinted with permission.

CREATING A COMPREHENSIVE GLOBAL 
ECONOMIC STRATEGY
Just as we need a comprehensive military strategy, 
globally, to deal with future security risks, we need 
a comprehensive global economic strategy to deal 
with future economic risks. Done properly, this will 
help strengthen and coalesce the Western democratic alliances over an extended period of time. 
This strategy has four pillars. 
First, we need a U.S. growth strategy.
Between 2000 and 2022, real U.S. GDP grew at an 
average rate of only 2% a year. Had we grown at 
3% instead, last year’s GDP per person would have 
been $15,000 higher. That would help pay for much 
of what we need to do as a nation. We simply have 
not focused enough on growing the U.S. economy. 
In prior letters, we have spoken about how we 
need to get public policy right to address a multitude of areas, which span ineffective education 
systems, soaring healthcare costs, excessive regulation and bureaucracy, the inability to plan and 
build infrastructure efficiently, inequitable taxes, a 
capricious and wasteful litigation system, frustrating immigration policies and reform, inefficient 
mortgage markets and housing markets and housing policy, a partially untrained and unprepared 
labor force, excessive student debt, and the lack of 
proper federal government budgeting and spending. I believe that our poor policies have restrained 
our growth, and simply improving those policies 
would accelerate our growth. 
We should also focus on reducing the worker 
shortages by allowing both more merit-based 
immigration and seasonal immigration. Reducing 
trade barriers could also have a rapid effect, and 
decreasing regulations and bureaucracy would be 
helpful. For example, starting a small business 
today generally requires multiple licenses, which 
take precious months to get. But it doesn’t end 
there. Talk with any small business owner, and that 
person will describe the mountains of red tape, 
inefficient systems and huge amount of documentation involved to operate the business. We need 
to reduce the burdens that are imposed on those 
who want to open and run a small business.
By seeking a bold, comprehensive approach, we 
increase our ability to positively impact economic 
growth and jobs; in fact, this is also the best way to 
reduce inflation and the deficit. 
Second, an industrial policy, done properly, 
could drive growth and also protect our 
national security.
The United States has essentially never had an 
“industrial policy,” a strategy by which the federal 
government, through incentives and policies, 
drives American industry. We have done it indirectly through things like the Defense Advanced 
Research Projects Agency and NASA’s moon mission but not generally by favoring industries. More 
directly, the IRA and the CHIPS Act provide specific 
incentives for EVs, semiconductors, rare earths, 
alternative energy sources and others. There are 
two reasons we should develop an industrial policy: 
1) specifically to safeguard our national security and 
2) to counter unfair economic competition, particularly where our national security is directly concerned. For example, making bicycles would not be 
part of the second example. But China, using subsidies and its economic muscle to dominate batteries, 
rare earths, semiconductors or EVs, could eventually imperil national security by disrupting our 
access to these products and materials. We cannot 
cede these important resources and capabilities 
to another country.
Crafting an industrial policy should be done properly 
and with a tightly restricted scope. If the policy is 
politically motivated, it will be used to benefit various political benefactors and eventually provoke 
extreme misallocation of capital and corruption. 
Managing the economy is extremely complex, and 
Adam Smith’s invisible hand still prevails — in a 
way we can never understand. If the government 
starts to micromanage through an industrial policy, 
it will not stop, and much of the efficiencies meant 
to be created will not be realized. Industrial policy 
should come with twins — very strict limitations on 
political interference and related comprehensive 
policy around factors like permitting requirements, which if not drastically improved will inhibit 
our ability to make investments and allow infrastructure to be built. 

OUR SERIOUS NEED FOR MORE EFFECTIVE PUBLIC POLICY AND COMPETENT GOVERNMENT

Third, fixing income inequality will reignite the 
American dream.
Of all the policy errors we need to remedy in America, there are two that I believe will have a dramatic 
effect on growth and equality — and go a long way 
toward repairing the frayed American dream. The 
first is providing graduating students and other 
individuals with work skills (in fields such as 
advanced manufacturing, cyber, data science and 
technology, healthcare and so on) that will lead to 
better paying jobs. This would be good for growth 
and much that ails us. And we know what to do. 
High schools and community colleges should 
work with local businesses to create specific skillstraining programs, internships and apprenticeships 
that prepare graduating students to be job ready — 
whether they go on to earn a credential, to work or 
to attend college. With 10.8 million job openings 
and 5.9 million unemployed workers in the United 
States, work-skills training has never been needed 
more. Businesses must be involved in this process, 
and programs need to be offered locally because 
that is where the actual jobs are.
The second step is related to the first: Get more 
income to lower-paid workers. The gap between 
skilled and unskilled workers has been growing 
dramatically — so much so that unskilled labor has 
become less and less a “living wage.” Of the 150 
million Americans working today, approximately 
21 million are paid less than $15 per hour. It is 
hard to live on $15 an hour, particularly for families (even if two household members are working). 
But all jobs should be treated with respect. Jobs 
and living wages bring dignity, lead to more 
opportunity — in housing, education, childcare, 
health and overall well-being — and also help 
rebuild communities as that income is used to 
improve how people live. 
A major step would be to expand the Earned 
Income Tax Credit (EITC), which many Democrats 
and Republicans already agree upon. Today, the 
EITC supplements low- to moderate-income 
working individuals and couples, particularly with 
children. For example, a single mother with two 
children earning $9 an hour (approximately 
$20,000 a year) could receive a tax credit of 
more than $6,000 at year’s end. Workers without 
children receive a very small tax credit — this 
should be dramatically expanded, too — and 
personally, I would eliminate the child requirement 
altogether. Last year, the EITC program cost the 
United States about $64 billion, and 31 million 
individuals received the credit. We should convert 
the EITC to make it more like a negative income 
payroll tax, paid monthly. Many people who are 
eligible for this benefit do not get it (often because 
they do not know about it). Proper reform of this 
program could increase benefits where deserved 
and reduce fraudulent and improper payments. 
Any tax credit income should not be offset by any 
other benefits these individuals already receive.
I have little doubt that this would do more than 
anything else to lift up lower-income neighborhoods as the money is spent on lifting up their 
families. I also have little doubt that this would add 
to GDP — because most of this money would, in 
fact, be spent. 
Fourth, America must take the lead on 
devising a comprehensive global economic 
strategy.
In an op-ed published by The Wall Street Journal 
earlier this year, I wrote: “Only America has the full 
capability to lead and coalesce the Western world, 
though we must do so respectfully and in partnership with our allies. Without cohesiveness and 
unity with our allies, autocratic forces will divide 
and conquer the bickering West. America needs to 
lead with its strengths—not only military but also 
economic, diplomatic and moral.”

OUR SERIOUS NEED FOR MORE EFFECTIVE PUBLIC POLICY AND COMPETENT GOVERNMENT

Getting military strategy right isn’t sufficient. 
We must keep the Western alliances together and 
actively appeal to developing nations. A comprehensive economic strategy would tighten the 
bonds, strengthen our alliances and, importantly, 
maximize our economic resources. Furthermore, it 
must encompass a global trade and investment 
strategy, a holistic plan around energy security 
and food security, and far more dynamic development finance for emerging markets. Done properly, the economic strength to emerge from such 
collaboration will preserve our alliances, entice

nations such as India into the fold, guarantee the 
strength of the U.S. military and preserve the 
mighty U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency.
Finally, more active diplomacy and more dynamic 
communication around the principles that motivate the Western world are required. These principles are life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness and 
the idea that all people are created equal. Democracy and human freedom are inseparable from 
freedom of speech, freedom of religion and free 
enterprise. We should loudly and proudly sing 
these values from the rooftops. 
In Closing
I would like to express my deep gratitude and appreciation for the 
290,000+ employees, and their families, of JPMorgan Chase. From this letter, 
I hope shareholders and all readers gain an appreciation for the tremendous 
character and capabilities of our people and how they continue to help 
communities around the world. They have faced these times of adversity with 
grace and fortitude. I hope you are as proud of them as I am. 
Finally, we sincerely hope that all the citizens and countries of the world 
return to normal after the pandemic, see an end to the ongoing war in Ukraine, 
and see a renaissance of a world on the path to peace and democracy.

uncertain; however, our data-driven 
approach to decision making, including 
risk management and investing, positions 
us well for what lies ahead.
We provide value to customers through 
the completeness and interconnectivity of 
our products, services, channels and 
experiences. We strive to make it easy to 
do business with us by engaging customers in the channel of their choice. 
Our strategy has not changed, and we are 
focused on a consistent set of strategic 
priorities:
1. Delivering financial performance that 
is consistently best-in-class 
2. Leveraging data and technology to 
drive speed to market and deliver 
customer value
3. Growing and deepening relationships 
by engaging customers with products 
and services they love and expanding 
our distribution
4. Protecting our customers and the firm 
through a strong risk and controls 
environment
5. Cultivating talent to build highperforming, diverse teams where 
culture is a competitive advantage
DELIVERING FINANCIAL 
PERFORMANCE THAT IS 
CONSISTENTLY BEST-IN-CLASS 
In 2022, CCB delivered a 29% return on 
equity (ROE) on net income of $14.9 billion. 
Revenue of $55 billion was up 10% yearover-year, and our overhead ratio was 
57%, down one percentage point.
We take a long-term approach to investments and focus on delivering sustainable 
growth and outperformance. Last year, 
we continued to invest in data and technology, in distribution through our branch 
network and marketing, and in our 
growth businesses. 
Our financial performance should also be 
considered in the context of the rapidly 
evolving macro environment, which 
created both headwinds and tailwinds for 
our lines of business. On the strength of 
our models to acquire, engage and retain 
customer relationships, we continued to 
drive core growth in most of our businesses. However, we acknowledge that 
our businesses are not immune to the 
macro landscape – Home Lending, in particular, faced shrinking total market size.
Average deposits of $1.2 trillion were up 
10% over 2021, and we extended our 
#1 market share in U.S. retail deposits3. 
In 2022, the historic speed and magnitude 
of rate hikes accelerated the return 
toward normalized deposit margins. 
We’re proud of the performance of 
Consumer & Community Banking (CCB) 
in 2022. In a rapidly changing macro 
environment, we delivered strong financial 
results, drove meaningful growth of our 
franchise and continued our disciplined 
approach to investing for the future. We 
continued to put the customer at the center 
of everything we do, across every interaction and line of business. Through the 
efforts of more than 135,000 talented CCB 
employees, we extended our leadership 
positions in retail deposits and credit card 
while gaining momentum in our growth 
businesses: Wealth Management and 
Connected Commerce. Overall, CCB has 
grown to serve nearly 80 million consumers and 5.7 million small businesses.
CCB is operating from a position of 
strength with our distribution and scale, 
exceptional products and highly 
respected brand. We take none of this for 
granted. We recognize that 2023 remains

Our customers remain on solid footing. 
While still elevated, cash buffers4 are 
down from their peak, as spending continued to be strong throughout 2022. 
We ended the year with $439 billion 
in average loans, up 1%. Credit performance across our portfolios remains 
strong, and, although net charge-offs 
were at historic lows, we continued to 
see normalization. In 2022, we built 
$1.1 billion in credit reserves. 
The diversification of the CCB franchise, 
which provides natural hedges and delivers industry-leading returns through the 
cycle, delivered another year exceeding 
25% ROE.
LEVERAGING DATA AND 
TECHNOLOGY TO DRIVE SPEED TO 
MARKET AND DELIVER CUSTOMER 
VALUE 
Data and technology are key differentiators and competitive advantages for CCB, 
enabling us to deliver innovation at scale. 
In 2022, our investments focused on two 
core categories: technology modernization and product development. These 
investments allow us to better respond to 
the needs of our customers, partners, 
employees and regulators — and to deliver 
the best of what Chase has to offer, with 
greater speed than ever before. 
On technology modernization, we are on 
a journey to mature our agile model, 
focused on our applications, infrastructure and data, and are already realizing 
benefits from this work. Our migration of 
all Chase.com customers to the public 
cloud is generating higher site availability 
and leading to a 50% reduction in runtime costs. We’re scaling the use of AI/ML 
across CCB, which delivered over $500 
million in value in 2022 alone, with more 
value to unlock in years to come.
On product development, we’re investing 
to drive engagement and deliver experiences customers love across channels, 
products and platforms. To do so, we 
operate in a fully agile product structure 
— with close to 100 products and services 
delivered by dedicated design, product, 
data and technology teams. We’ve 
enhanced the Chase Mobile® app and 
Chase.com, making it easier for customers to manage their everyday financial 
lives and engage with a richer offering of 
products and features. We also improved 
our platforms and experiences so customers can perform more activities with 
ease — such as more seamlessly opening 
new accounts.
Data and technology are critical enablers, 
driving business value over time. The full 
scope of benefits will manifest in a number of key areas — from reliability and 
speed to market to employee satisfaction.
GROWING AND DEEPENING 
RELATIONSHIPS BY ENGAGING 
CUSTOMERS WITH PRODUCTS 
AND SERVICES THEY LOVE AND 
EXPANDING OUR DISTRIBUTION 
In 2022, we grew our customer base by 
nearly 4% across all our lines of business. 
Here, our primary measure is customer5 
growth because it indicates success as we 
strive to be the bank for all and to deepen 
and engage customer relationships.
Banking and Wealth Management
Our goal is to grow primary bank relationships with our customers across Banking 
and Wealth Management. Core to that 
goal is having the right products, experiences and distribution to meet our 
customers in their channel of choice 
and serve more of their financial needs. 
Our strategy is working. We are #1 in U.S. 
retail deposit share, driven by growth of 
more than $400 billion in deposits over the 
past three years. Key to this growth is the 
branch — and our branch network is second 
to none. We have the right branches in the 
right locations to capture a larger customer 
base in both legacy and new markets. 
Our branches are a local storefront, where 
digital engagement comes together with 
our bankers and advisors to deliver the 
full capabilities of JPMorgan Chase. Last 
year, nearly 40 million customers walked 
into our almost 5,000 branches. In 2021, 
we became the first bank with branches in 
all lower 48 states and have delivered on 
our commitment of 400 new branches in 
25 states and the District of Columbia. Not 
only are our seasoned branches delivering 
value to our customers, communities and 
shareholders, but the investment in new 
branches is a key driver to market share 
gains over time. Our model’s success gives 
us confidence to continue to invest in new 
branches in high-opportunity markets 
where we still have significant untapped 
opportunity. 
Beyond our investments in the branch 
network, we continue to scale and 
improve products that meet the distinct 
needs of customers across segments. 
Last year, we enhanced our cash flow 
management solutions. We launched 
early direct deposit for our Secure 
BankingSM customers, which allows them 
to access their paychecks up to two days 
early, and we enhanced Chase Overdraft 
AssistSM to provide an extra day before 
charging an overdraft fee.
It’s part of our job to make it easy for 
customers to have more of their banking 
relationship with us. We’re continuing

to invest in natural adjacencies to the 
Consumer Banking franchise so we can 
deepen and grow Business Banking and 
Wealth Management efficiently. 
For our Business Banking customers, we 
offer products, services and expertise to 
make it easier than ever to start, run and 
grow their businesses. We made it simpler 
to open a checking account, introduced 
more convenient methods to pay and get 
paid, and created a streamlined digital 
lending experience for faster access to 
capital when customers need it. We take 
pride in helping entrepreneurs go from 
idea to IPO and beyond.
For our Wealth Management clients, 
we’re growing our advisor base and 
developing products and capabilities 
to serve clients across the wealth continuum. In 2022, we added more than 
300 advisors on our path to 6,000, 
launched new products such as Wealth 
Plan and Personal Advisors, and 
continued to make enhancements to 
Self-Directed Investing. Our goal is to 
achieve $1 trillion in assets over the next 
several years, and we’re on track to do so. 
Payments, lending, commerce
We continue to be the #1 credit card 
issuer in the United States for both spend 
and lend, crossing $1 trillion in sales 
volume in 2022. It is our marketing 
engine that fuels distribution and scale. 
Marketing is to Card what bankers, 
branches and advisors are to banking: 
baseline distribution. Our strategy is 
working. In 2022, we drove a 20% yearover-year increase in new accounts within 
our risk appetite. This drove our share of 
outstandings to 17.3%, up nearly 75 basis 
points — healthy progress toward our goal 
of 20% lend share over the long term. 
A large part of our Card strategy is to get 
the right products into customers’ hands. 
Over the last three years, we refreshed 
our entire branded card portfolio to 
ensure our cards’ value propositions were 
best-in-class and set up to perform well. 
We also renewed valuable relationships 
with our co-brand partners that cover the 
vast majority of co-brand spend share to 
at least 2027. Beyond consumer cards, 
we’re making progress on the opportunity 
with business customers, launching Ink 
Business PremierSM in the second half of 
2022. While it’s early days, the new card 
has been well-received, attracting higherrevenue small businesses that spend multiples above the average.
Payments remain a center of gravity 
for financial relationships. We are a leading payments franchise in the United 
States, enabling our customers to move 
more than $5.6 trillion in 2022 across 
payment methods. 
To extend that leadership position, we’re 
also investing in our Commerce business. 
The strategy here is straightforward: Lean 
into what our customers do on our cards 
all the time — spend on travel, dining and 
shopping — and invest in digital experiences for Chase to win in discovery, booking, paying and borrowing across these 
journeys. With our recent acquisitions of 
cxLoyalty, FROSCH, Figg and The Infatuation, we now own differentiated assets 
and experiences in travel, offers and dining. We’re leveraging our new assets and 
talent to build out our two-sided platform, 
connecting customers and merchants as 
only a company with our scale and digitally engaged customer base can. 
Our efforts produced meaningful results 
in 2022:
• Chase Travel: Our travel business 
delivered ~$8 billion in volume booked 
in 2022 
• Chase Offers: We drove over $6 billion 
in spend to merchants who used our 
offers platform
• My Chase Plan®: Two years post-launch, 
we’ve opened more than 7 million plans 
The Connected Commerce business is 
driving impact for Chase by improving 
satisfaction, stimulating engagement and 
creating capital-light, recurring revenue 
streams, all while making the core franchise more resilient long term. As we told 
you at Investor Day last year, we expect 
to drive more than $30 billion in volume 
through our Commerce platforms in the 
next few years.
Omnichannel engagement
Earning the right to be the primary 
financial partner for consumers and small 
businesses requires us to build trust by 
delivering experiences our customers 
expect — in both major and everyday 
moments. The completeness of our 
product set can serve all of our customers’ banking, lending and investing needs.

Our true differentiator is the combination 
of delivering award-winning digital capabilities to our 63 million active digital 
users, our extensive physical network 
spanning all lower 48 states, and our 
more than 50,000 local bankers, advisors, business relationship managers and 
branch managers, who operate as a local 
team of experts to serve customer needs.
We’re building and delivering experiences 
our customers love and achieved recordhigh customer satisfaction across channels7 
in 2022. Although we’re proud of this, we 
are never satisfied and recognize there’s 
always more to do for our customers. We 
prioritize improving activities our customers do most often in their everyday lives, 
such as opening an account, replacing a 
card and making a payment. We also help 
them with major life milestones, like planning for their future through goals-based 
plans or searching for and buying a car 
or a home.
A key part of our engagement strategy is 
ensuring we reach historically underserved populations. We continue to make 
meaningful strides in our community 
strategy in support of our $30 billion 
racial equity commitment announced in 
October 2020. Since then, we have:
• Opened 13 Community Center branches 
in minority neighborhoods and hired 
over 140 Community Managers
• Conducted over 9,000 financial health 
sessions with more than 190,000 
attendees 
• Hired ~160 Community Home Lending 
Advisors and expanded our homebuyer 
grant program to more than 10,000 
minority neighborhoods nationwide 
• Provided complimentary one-on-one 
coaching to nearly 3,000 small businesses through dedicated consultants 
in 21 U.S. cities and launched a national 
special purpose credit program to 
improve access to credit for small 
business owners in historically underserved areas
PROTECTING OUR CUSTOMERS 
AND THE FIRM THROUGH A 
STRONG RISK AND CONTROLS 
ENVIRONMENT
Everyone’s top priority in CCB is to protect our customers and the firm. Having 
the proper governance and processes in 
place ensures our business is sustainable 
and resilient and meets regulatory 
requirements. Coupled with our fortress 
balance sheet, this strength attracts a 
strong, diversified customer base that has 
confidence in the safety and security of 
banking with Chase.
Through data and analytics, we continue 
to enhance our risk management capabilities across CCB. Keeping our credit appetite constant, machine learning is helping 
us surgically extend more credit to more 
consumers and small businesses. While 
fraud is everywhere, we are improving 
our ability to protect customers earlier 
and more often. Education plays a big 
role, too. Bankers, Community Managers 
and marketing work together to help 
customers build healthy financial habits 
and avoid becoming victims of fraud. 
CULTIVATING TALENT TO BUILD 
HIGH-PERFORMING, DIVERSE 
TEAMS WHERE CULTURE IS A 
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE 
Our people continue to be our greatest 
asset. We attract the best talent from all 
backgrounds who choose to work at 
Chase because of the impact we have 
on our customers and communities and 
the opportunity to grow their career. 
We strive to create a culture where everyone’s voice matters, leading to the best 
business outcomes.
Our employees embrace the full spectrum 
of career opportunities that Chase offers 
— across lines of business, functions and 
roles. They grow with us and move across 
our businesses to develop unique perspectives that help us solve the most important 
and complicated issues across the firm.

great humility. We wouldn’t trade our 
hand with anyone’s. Our scale, distribution, brand, products and people position 
us well to continue to achieve best-inclass performance for decades to come.

CORPORATE & INVESTMENT BANK
Corporate & 
Investment Bank
The CIB generated $15 billion in net 
income on revenue of $48 billion in 
2022, a solid performance following 
record net income and revenue in 2021. 
Industrywide investment banking fees 
fell 42% from the prior year1, and 
J.P. Morgan’s fees followed suit, down 
48% from 2021. This was not unexpected. Industrywide investment 
banking fees have averaged about 
$80 billion per year from 2015 to 20201 
so 2022 was a lighter-than-average 
year, more comparable with the 
pre-pandemic years of 2018 and 2019. 
Even so, we finished the year #1 in 
investment banking fees, #1 in equity 
capital markets, #1 in debt capital markets and #2 in mergers and acquisitions1. 
In 2022, our M&A franchise advised on 
over 350 deals that totaled more than 
$900 billion, including some of the 
year’s biggest deals, notably in the 
healthcare industry for Johnson & 
Johnson and Pfizer.
With declining M&A activity and higher 
rates slowing refinancings, our debt 
underwriting fees declined 43% yearover-year in 2022. More positively, 
we’re proud of the discipline we kept in 
underwriting, particularly in our leveraged finance business. This puts us in 
prime position to help companies when 
activity picks up. 
Equity capital markets also saw a dramatic drop-off in deal activity during 
the year. Volatile and uncertain markets 
nearly shut down the IPO market, 
although J.P. Morgan did help lead two 
of the year’s most notable deals: AIG’s 
$1.7 billion IPO of Corebridge, its retirement solutions and life insurance business, and Volkswagen’s €9.4 billion IPO 
of Porsche. 
Meanwhile, we have continued to scale 
up our regional investment banking 
capabilities across the United States.
Working with the Commercial Bank, we 
are deepening relationships with middle 
market sponsors and aligning coverage 
teams to support growth industries, 
particularly technology, healthcare and 
the green economy. 
Our Markets business continues to be 
the top-ranked franchise in the world 
by revenue2. The business outperformed 
even our own expectations in 2022, 
generating revenue of $29 billion, just 
short of 2020’s record highs, as volatility persisted. 
Interest rate hikes and geopolitical tensions had investors repositioning portfolios, driving Fixed Income revenue 
higher, particularly in our Currencies & 
Emerging Markets and Rates trading 
businesses. Overall, we reported $18.6 
billion in Fixed Income revenue, up 10% 
from the previous year, and retained 
our top wallet share2. Equities revenue 
came in at $10.4 billion. Underscoring 
the strides we’ve made in Equities, the 
business has grown revenue by more 
than 80% since 2017, and market share 
has increased by almost 300 basis 
points over the same period2. Another 
notable success in 2022 was our Global 
Research team’s top ranking across all 
three of Institutional Investor’s annual 
global surveys.
2022 was a watershed year for financial 
markets. 
Tasked with taming inflation and cooling 
an overheating economy, the Federal 
Reserve raised interest rates seven 
times in 2022 to levels not seen in 
nearly 15 years. 
The end of near-zero interest rates 
meant that many young, emerging companies needed to focus on profitability 
rather than revenue growth at any cost. 
Higher rates also dented investors’ 
confidence and tested their patience in 
assets such as special purpose acquisition companies and cryptocurrencies, 
which benefited so much from excess 
capital just a year ago.
Geopolitics dominated headlines and 
moved markets. In February, Russia 
invaded Ukraine, fomenting a humanitarian crisis that worsens even now. 
The war disrupted supply chains and 
forced countries to rethink their entire 
approach to sourcing energy, food and 
other critical resources, with every 
issue now being viewed through the 
lens of national security. 
BENEFITS OF BUSINESS DIVERSITY
In recent shareholder letters, I’ve 
stressed the key pillars of a strategy we 
set years ago: to be global, diversified, 
complete and at scale. That strategy has 
served us well and continues to serve us 
well across the Corporate & Investment 
Bank (CIB) and our wholesale businesses. We and our clients benefit from 
our strong, balanced business during 
volatile times and market dislocations, 
including those we have witnessed in 
the last few months.

Capital for the climate
Climate change is one of the most 
pressing challenges of our age. With the 
introduction of the Inflation Reduction 
Act and the need for solutions to 
Europe’s energy challenges, a major 
opportunity exists in committing capital 
and expertise to help clients transition 
to the low-carbon economy. In 2022, 
the CIB facilitated $164 billion in transactions (toward the firmwide target of 
$2.5 trillion by the end of 2030) to further sustainable development, including 
$1 trillion to support green initiatives. 
This predominantly consisted of leading 
or participating in environmental, social 
and governance (ESG)-related bond 
issuances, providing derivative hedging 
and advising on M&A deals.
Moving forward, we plan to deepen our 
coverage of clients engaged in the 
green economy and low-carbon transition, create new products and allocate 
capital to finance ESG objectives. We 
will also build on the success of our two 
centers of excellence: the Center for 
Carbon Transition and ESG Solutions, a 
specialist team of investment bankers 
who provide ESG-related advice and 
transaction support.

4 Firmwide Payments and CIB Payments revenue metrics

Scale is essential to run a successful 
and profitable Markets business, and 
the capital required to fuel our global 
trading desks has risen significantly 
over the last five years. While this 
increase has been a headwind, our 
business has been disciplined in 
deploying capital and continues to 
deliver strong returns. With the strategic initiatives we have in place, we’re 
confident in our strategy as market 
structure evolves. 
Our Securities Services business, which 
provides essential post-trade services 
to our institutional asset-manager 
and asset-owner clients, also had a 
strong year, reporting record revenue 
of $4.5 billion. 
Investment over the years has allowed 
us to steadily grow revenue and market 
share in Securities Services2 while maintaining a top-tier operating margin.
The scale of our business is remarkable. 
We provide safekeeping, settlement and 
services for securities in approximately 
100 markets around the world, and at 
the end of 2022, assets under custody3 
exceeded $28 trillion. 
Turning to Payments, the business saw 
strong growth in 2022, generating 
firmwide revenue of nearly $14 billion, 
$4 billion more than in 2021, due in 
large part to the effect of higher 
rates4. Payments revenue generated 
from the CIB alone increased 33% 
from the previous year4. 
Serving more than 30,000 clients 
across the CIB and Commercial Banking 
and approximately 300,000 small- and 
medium-sized enterprises in the United 
States and Canada, the business continued to win new mandates and deepen 
relationships with the world’s largest

Over the last five years, the CIB’s new

for both corporate and financial institution clients. 
INNOVATION, TALENT AND 
INVESTMENT 
I am very proud of our people, our 
results and the vital role our business 
plays in supporting global economies 
and commerce and in maintaining 
liquid, orderly markets. That role is 
amplified by the close collaboration 
across our businesses, which has 
allowed us to grow and invest while 
still maintaining strong returns for our 
shareholders. Innovation and investment are critical as we work to meet 
clients’ evolving needs, as the competition intensifies and as we look to capitalize on several exciting opportunities.

CORPORATE & INVESTMENT BANK
Boom in private capital markets
Another opportunity is the rapid growth 
in private capital markets. In 2022, we 
were involved in nearly 60 deals, raising 
$12 billion in proceeds. We also launched 
our Capital Connect platform, which 
reinvented the traditional private capital 
raise, seamlessly connecting investors 
with earlier-stage companies. Helping 
a client at an early stage can result in a 
client-for-life relationship, leading to 
opportunities in global corporate and 
private banking and potentially an IPO 
or sell-side M&A mandate. 
Private debt markets have also grown 
significantly in the last five years and at 
a much faster pace than the syndicated 
lending market5. To compete, we have set 
up a new direct lending initiative that has 
already funded dozens of deals, helping 
to deepen relationships, especially with 
middle market clients.
The halo effect in trading 
In trading, we believe that being complete 
continues to offer huge advantages. 
Providing a complete set of trading products creates a halo effect, making it more 
attractive for clients to trade with us 
across the full range of our products. 
Our diversification also provides balance 
to our revenue regardless of the macroeconomic environment. For example, in 
2021, equities outperformed while in 
2022, fixed income macro businesses 
were the main growth engines.
We are also committed to providing a 
seamless and differentiated experience 
across the trade life cycle — from pretrade through to execution to post-trade. 
For pre-trade, we are the clear leader in 
research, offering analysis on more than 
5,200 companies and around 80 economies worldwide. With so much content, 
our focus has been on improving the client 
experience, ensuring we’re delivering relevant, timely reports in the most accessible and digestible formats. For post-trade, 
our Securities Services business offers 
comprehensive middle- and back-office 
services to complete the full trade life 
cycle experience for our clients.
Finally, we want to capitalize on secular 
growth trends in the industry. For 
instance, over the last five years, the 
industry wallet with large institutional clients has grown more than with other 
financial institutions. Increasingly, these 
large clients need banks with size, scale 
and solutions to manage complex portfolios. Being a reliable, complete counterparty, our market share with this particular group of clients has grown more than 
350 basis points over the past five years6. 
All of our clients continue to embrace 
electronic trading. Through the years, 
we’ve invested heavily in our electronic 
trading capabilities, both in areas that 
have been at the forefront of electronification, such as equities and foreign 
exchange, and in those where the industry has been slower to embrace the trend, 
such as credit. 
Growth opportunities in data services 
In Securities Services, the rising complexity of funds is creating opportunities as 
we continue to evolve to meet the changing needs of our clients. As a result, we 
have been modernizing our core custody 
and fund accounting infrastructure to create scale and efficiency. 
We are also investing to expand our capabilities in areas like exchange-traded fund 
(ETF) servicing, middle-office outsourcing 
and alternatives — all of which are growth 
areas for our business. 
Looking ahead, clients will increasingly 
turn to service providers for help in managing their data. Anticipating this development, we launched our Fusion platform 
in 2022, and we’re already building strong 
brand recognition in the market. Providing seamless and efficient solutions for 
discovering, managing and analyzing data 
will unlock new opportunities to deliver 
value to our investor clients.

Software solutions for healthcare and 
connected cars
Our Payments business also operates at 
tremendous scale and lightning speed, 
moving more than $9 trillion each day 
across 160 countries and 120 currencies. 
We are investing to further scale and 
modernize our core payments infrastructure, as well as to develop the networks of the future. From peer-to-peer 
blockchain connections to JPM Coin, 
programmable money and digitization 
of assets, we’re seeking to make sending, 
managing and receiving money easier, 
faster and more secure.
Connections with other parts of our firm, 
including Investment Banking, Commercial Banking, Markets and Retail Banking, 
are opening opportunities for Payments, 
especially with the 5.8 million small businesses that already bank with Chase. As 
the only bank with end-to-end in-house 
acquiring and treasury capabilities, we 
have created an ecosystem that provides 
merchants with everything from smart 
terminals and tap-on-phone solutions to 
consumer trends and insights drawn from 
issuing and acquiring data.
Another big opportunity exists in 
developing data and software-as-aservice solutions for platform businesses and industry verticals such as 
healthcare and connected cars. For 
example, in U.S. healthcare, InstaMed, 
which we acquired in 2019, digitizes 
interactions between patient, payers 
and providers, seamlessly processing 
payments and moving healthcare data. 
Now connected to approximately 60% 
of U.S. healthcare providers, it has 
created an extensive network for our 
clients. Similar opportunities exist in 
the fast-changing mobility industry, 
impacting not only the automotive 
sector but energy, utilities and 
commerce. Through our partnership 
with Volkswagen Financial Services 
and majority stake in Volkswagen Pay, 
we are exploring a future in which cars 
will be used as smart payment devices 
and commerce platforms. 
In this and many other areas, our accelerated investments over the past few 
years are helping to future-proof our 
business. As we compete with banks 
and fintechs, we have the best of both: 
scale, end-to-end capabilities and direct 
relationships with clients of all sizes.
WELL-POSITIONED FOR THE 
FUTURE
Global markets have already encountered 
significant challenges in the new year — 
from interest rate volatility to market and 
geopolitical uncertainty. 
And with central banks tightening in ways 
we haven’t seen before as they wrestle 
with ongoing inflationary pressures, 
market uncertainty is likely to persist and 
weigh on growth in the United States and 
other developed economies in 2023.
More positively, we are well-positioned to 
help clients in any environment. Our 
scale, completeness and culture of collaboration are key differentiators as clients 
increasingly look to us for solutions that 
straddle different business lines. 
I am incredibly proud of how our employees supported clients in 2022. Our performance and the opportunities ahead 
show what an amazing hand our business has — and give me immense confidence and hope for the future.

SERVING MORE 
EXTRAORDINARY CLIENTS 
CB’s strategy is anchored on being our 
clients’ most important financial partner, 
and we do this by delivering the expertise 
and capabilities of our global firm locally. 
In 2022, we continued to extend and 
deepen our reach by growing our U.S. 
and international footprint, enabling us 
to increase our addressable market and 
serve more exceptional clients around 
the world.
We expanded to five additional U.S. 
states and four new countries:
• In the United States, CB established 
a presence in Idaho, Montana, Nevada, 
New Mexico and South Carolina and is 
now in 78 of the top 100 metropolitan 
statistical areas, with a potential to cover 
more than 48,000 prospective clients.
• We achieved a significant milestone 
in 2022 when we became the first bank 
able to accept government deposits in 
all 50 U.S. states, allowing us to bring 
our services to more local governments 
and their residents. 
• Outside the United States, we 
expanded into Denmark, Finland, 
Norway and Sweden and now have 80 
bankers calling on more than 2,000 
prospective, non-U.S.-headquartered 
clients in 24 countries.
We’re thoughtfully growing our team 
to support several high-potential 
opportunities:
• We’ve maintained our focus on middle 
market companies with revenue less 
than $100 million and added bankers 
to serve more than 12,000 companies 
in this important segment, doubling 
our client relationships since 2018.
• Both in the United States and EMEA, 
we continued building our Green Economy and Innovation Economy teams to 
provide tailored support to these critical sectors that are advancing economic growth and sustainability. CB is 
well-positioned to serve clients from 
startup to IPO and beyond, partnering 
In 2022, Commercial Banking (CB) 
remained focused on executing our 
long-term strategy — growing our client 
franchise, investing in our platform 
and capabilities, and empowering and 
enabling our teams. We continued to 
stand by our clients, delivering capital, 
advice and solutions to help them 
best navigate an uncertain market 
environment.
I’m incredibly proud of our results and 
the notable market leadership positions 
we achieved last year. 
CB reported record revenue of 
$11.5 billion, net income of $4.2 billion 
and a return on equity of 16%. Our strong 
performance was largely driven by adding 
clients, expanding into new markets and 
maintaining higher deposit margins.
• We had our third-best year for 
Investment Banking, with $3 billion 
in revenue1.
• Commercial & Industrial loans increased 
by 11% year-over-year2. 
• Commercial Real Estate loans grew 
7% year-over-year2.
• Credit performance remained strong, 
with net charge-offs of 4 basis points.
Our business continues to perform 
extremely well in a complex and competitive environment. The sustained investments we’re making across our franchise 
are accelerating our organic growth, and 
our success is compounding. This letter will 
give you a window into our business and 
the tremendous runway that lies ahead.

has been very positive, and we are looking for more ways to serve this important segment of our economy.
CHAMPIONING OUR CLIENTS’ 
SUCCESS WITH POWERFUL 
SOLUTIONS 
Our ability to deliver JPMorgan Chase’s 
full suite of solutions remains a key competitive advantage. In 2022, we continued 
to make significant investments in our 
capabilities, innovating to drive even 
more value for our clients. 
• We’re offering new, simple digital 
banking platforms and integrated payment solutions to help clients run their 
businesses more effectively. 
• In collaboration with our CIB partners, 
we’re providing clients with a more 
complete set of financing alternatives 
with the addition of our new direct 
lending offering.
• We introduced Story by J.P. MorganTM, 
our all-in-one property management 
tool that offers multifamily property 
owners and operators valuable data, 
insights and an intuitive rent payments 
platform to best manage their real 
estate assets.
INVESTING IN TECHNOLOGY AND 
DATA TO OPTIMIZE OUR BUSINESS
We continue to make excellent progress 
in building a truly data-driven business, 
using our unique assets to enhance our 
operating processes and deliver valuable 
insights to both our teams and clients. 
The impact from this effort has been 
quite exciting, and the investments we 
are making will drive tremendous benefit 
for years to come.
• CB continued to scale and optimize 
our cloud-based data platform and 
expanded our team of data scientists to 
help unlock even more value and embed 
business intelligence into all we do. 
• Our robust customer relationship 
management platform and 
collaboration tools promote connectivity across the firm, enabling us to serve 
clients with greater precision and 
foster new relationships. 
• Using insights from our operating 
data, we markedly improved client 
satisfaction scores by enhancing and 
streamlining both our onboarding 
process and client service experience.
DEEPENING OUR FOCUS ON 
COMMUNITY IMPACT
While growth and innovation are essential to CB’s success, perhaps just as 
important is our focus on being a purpose-driven business. Our firm has long 
championed the essential role of banking in a community, a concept that is 
deeply woven into the strategy and culture of our franchise. In CB, we are using 
the power of our business — doing what 
we do best every day — to drive real 
outcomes in our communities.

It was an important transition year for 
financial markets in 2022 as the world 
adjusted to the move from near-zero 
interest rates and quantitative easing — 
in order to stimulate post-COVID economies — to rapid interest rate increases 
and global quantitative tightening. The 
unprecedented speed of this reset caused 
significant market dislocations, with 
higher discount rates leading to severe 
asset repricing. For the first time in more 
than 50 years, both stock and bond markets had negative returns, calling into 
question the diversification principles of 
asset allocation.
Through it all, J.P. Morgan Asset & Wealth 
Management (AWM) drew upon its two 
centuries of experience navigating global 
markets and providing forward-looking 
insights to ensure that our clients had the 
planning and investment advice they 
needed to sustain a long-term perspective. 
Our relentless focus on risk management 
and comprehensive controls over all 
our activities has helped us guide and support our clients throughout the years — 
especially during more challenging times.
As fiduciaries for millions of clients, and 
with more than $4 trillion of their assets, 
we never take for granted the trust and 
confidence they place in us, and we work 
tirelessly to re-earn it each and every day.
INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE FOR 
OUR CLIENTS
For many years, I have written about the 
importance of being an active investor, 
as the world is constantly evolving — 
yesterday’s leading opportunities are 
not guaranteed to be tomorrow’s. In 
2022, these principles were reinforced, 
as actively managed portfolios — an area 
in which J.P. Morgan has long excelled — 
proved their value in delivering strong 
returns for clients.
AWM has one of the industry’s largest 
internal research budgets and employs 
more than 1,100 investment professionals 
who cover over 2,500 companies, spanning every asset class and major geography. These individuals methodically travel 
around the world to uncover compelling 
investment opportunities for our clients; 
last year alone, they held over 5,000 
meetings with companies and management teams.
Our durable approach helped us deliver 
strong investment performance amid the 
historic levels of volatility in 2022, particularly in our Fixed Income and Equity 
platforms, outpacing most of our largest 
peers, especially those with more passive 
approaches to investing assets. In fact, 
across the three-, five- and 10-year time 
horizons, our investment performance in 
those asset classes has never been stronger. Our long-term mutual fund assets 
under management (AUM) outperforming 
the peer median over 10 years increased 
from a strong 86% in 2021 to an even 
better 90% in 2022.
Clients rewarded our consistent and 
strong outperformance by entrusting us 
with even more of their assets. AWM not 
only achieved its 19th consecutive year of 
net new inflows, but we also ranked in the 
top three of public peers for net client 
inflows over the past five years.
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE FOR 
OUR SHAREHOLDERS
With delivering superior investment performance as our guiding principle, our 
revenue grew by 5% to reach a record

While pre-tax income was lower in 2022 
than the previous year, it reflected our 
purposeful investments in our world-class 
talent, cutting-edge technologies and 
superior client coverage. With a healthy 
pre-tax margin of 33% that is among the 
industry’s highest, AWM has continued to 
deliver operating leverage to our shareholders over the past five years.
INVESTING IN THE FUTURE OF OUR 
FRANCHISE 
One of our most significant investments 
has been in our effort to increase our roster of high-quality GPB advisors. Our 
commitment in this area yielded results, 
and in 2022, for the first time, we surpassed 3,000 GPB advisors. Once hired, 
our advisors go through our world-class 
training programs to set them on a path 
to success and help them grow through 
each stage of their career.
We also saw progress in our systematic 
efforts to expand our capabilities to meet 
client demand. We have invested heavily 
in JPMAM’s active exchange-traded fund 
(ETF) business, which in just a few years 
has grown from two solutions with 
$237 million in AUM to 78 U.S. and UCITS 
ETFs, representing more than $54 billion 
in AUM. With a lineup that includes two of 
the industry’s largest and top-performing 
active ETFs — JPMorgan Equity Premium 
Income ETF (JEPI) and JPMorgan UltraShort Income ETF (JPST) — JPMAM ended 
2022 ranked #2 in global active ETF AUM.
In addition to organic growth, AWM has 
made several acquisitions in recent years, 
each of which is making valuable contributions to our business:
• 55ip, our customized tax-loss harvesting engine, built new, more highly 
scalable platforms to handle separate 
accounts, along with additional 
tax-managed strategies.

OPTIMISTIC FOR THE FUTURE 
We know there will always be unexpected 
volatility in the broader environment. As 
a fiduciary, we constantly stress test portfolios to prepare clients for those scenarios. Recent events in 2023’s first quarter 
have reminded us of those risks. Today’s 
financial system is stronger than any time 
before, and it will emerge even more 
resilient as we apply lessons learned to 
the future. As tough as 2022 was on markets, the good news is the starting point 
for the next 10 to 15 years of future 
return assumptions has increased nearly 
70%, from 4.3% last year to 7.2%8.
I am so proud of the breadth and consistency of our success in delivering value to 
our clients and shareholders. We remain 
relentlessly focused on being the advisor 
of choice to the world’s most prominent 
institutions, pension funds, central banks, 
individuals and families. Our commitment 
to doing first-class business in a first-class 
way for these clients is what makes AWM 
a special gem inside JPMorgan Chase.
I also take great pride in how we helped 
clients and our shareholders navigate the 
challenges of 2022 and across past market cycles, and I am optimistic about the 
opportunities ahead and our role in helping to deliver the best possible outcomes 
for all our stakeholders.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
Corporate Responsibility
Corporate Responsibility at JPMorgan 
Chase takes a robust, holistic approach to 
driving inclusive economic growth in communities around the world. Combining our 
philanthropy, research, policy recommendations and advocacy, while working with 
leaders at every level of government and 
business, we advance strategies to help 
move the needle on significant challenges 
affecting the communities we serve, from 
closing the racial wealth gap and tackling 
the skilled labor shortage to making the 
economy and communities more resilient.
At the core of our integrated model is 
a focus on outcomes. Bringing together 
our resources — including our expertise 
and community network — we work to 
generate solutions that benefit customers, communities and the economy at 
large. We see this in how JPMorgan 
Chase develops banking products, 
supports clients and communities, 
and powers the economy. 
Promoting financial health. Far too many 
people lack access to the products and 
services they need to improve their financial health, including checking and savings 
accounts. To help close America’s wealth 
gap, we looked to consumer data, social 
entrepreneurs and our long-standing community partners for insights, which influenced the design of products like Chase 
Secure BankingSM, an affordable and safe 
account option serving nearly 1.5 million 
customers, and Autosave, a tool used by 
1.9 million consumers to simplify and automate savings. With nonprofits like the 
Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund, 
we helped establish national standards 
for products similar to Secure Banking so 
more people can access low-cost banking 
services. And with Autosave, we leveraged 
insights from the JPMorgan Chase Institute 
and collaborated with consumer advocates 
and community leaders to understand the 
most effective strategies to help even 
more customers meet their savings goals 
and set aside money for unexpected 
expenses like car repairs or medical bills.
Increasing access to economic opportunity. We believe that when communities 
thrive, businesses thrive. In Seine-SaintDenis (SSD), just outside of Paris where 
30% of young people live in poverty, we 
are putting our model to work to help 
spur economic growth. Nearly five years 
ago, we made a $30 million philanthropic 
commitment to support communities in 
Greater Paris, particularly in SSD. We 
started by collaborating with government 
agencies and nonprofits on skills training 
and small business growth, assessing and 
updating our strategy along the way. This 
effort reached people like Fatou, an 
entrepreneur who, with the assistance of 
our nonprofit partner Adie, learned how 
to win public and private contracts for her 
security company. She was able to get 
her business off the ground and grow her 
client network. Fatou is one of more than 
6,700 entrepreneurs and 600 local businesses who have received such support 
in addition to the 23,000 SSD residents 
who have received necessary skills training to advance their careers. We are 
continuing to learn from the outcomes 
of our work in Greater Paris, coordinating 
closely with local policymakers and 
organizations as we plan to enhance our 
commitment going forward.
Supporting global growth and security. 
The war in Ukraine has upended millions 
of lives and created a significant shortage 
of energy supplies. Over the past year, we 
have worked closely with leaders across 
our company, clients and policymakers to 
navigate these unprecedented social, economic and energy security challenges. 
Once again, we are taking a comprehensive approach, informing business decisions to advance energy security and scale 
clean technology solutions while providing 
$10 million in philanthropic capital to 
address critical humanitarian needs and 
help launch career training and upskilling 
programs for Ukrainian refugees in 
Poland. And we are thinking toward the 
future, advising the Ukrainian government 
on its plan for a postwar recovery. This is a 
pivotal moment for the global economy, 
and we will continue to leverage our wide 
range of expertise and insights to navigate 
complex global dynamics.
Generating impact is a business imperative. Improving our products, strengthening communities, and supporting a 
more inclusive and secure global economy are inextricably tied to the success 
of our company. Even as we seek to 
manage uncertainty and market distress 
to promote a sound financial system, it 
remains the responsibility of both the 
public and private sectors to come 
together to identify solutions that will 
lead to greater prosperity.
Demetrios Marantis 
Global Head of Corporate Responsibility 

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
In Corporate Responsibility, we aim to 
help strengthen the global financial 
system by supporting economic opportunity that is equitable and accessible. 
We help identify solutions to major 
global challenges thanks to the investments we’ve made to build a strong and 
sustainable company. 
Every day, we apply what we’ve learned 
from supporting our customers and 
clients to help build more resilient 
communities. This approach allows us 
to focus on the ingredients essential for 
inclusive growth: jobs and skills training, 
small business growth, community 
development and financial health. 
Here are some ways we bring the full 
force of the firm — combining our business resources, community and government engagement, philanthropic capital, 
data and expertise — to promote a stronger, more inclusive economy. 
Safeguarding sound financial systems
The global economy is only as resilient as 
its financial systems. Around the world, 
we’re working with policy groups, trade 
associations and regulators so we can 
extend loans, make capital investments 
and provide services that help people 
access more opportunities. 
In 2020, we joined the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency’s launch of 
Project REACh (Roundtable for Economic 
Access and Change), formed to identify 
and reduce barriers to full and fair participation in the United States’ banking 
system and economy. We were the first 
major financial institution to launch an 
initiative to provide credit to customers 
with no credit history, and we have now 
approved credit cards for roughly 15,000 
new-to-credit customers. This helps 
people to build credit scores and access 
lower-priced mainstream credit products, 
which could eventually include a mortgage — one of America’s most important 
sources of generational wealth.
Accelerating climate and 
sustainability solutions
Across our company, we are taking measures to respond to the climate challenge 
against the backdrop of a global energy 
crisis. In December, we issued our 
Climate Report outlining how we are 
scaling green solutions to support our 
clients’ business goals, investing in new 
clean energy technology that creates 
local economic growth and jobs, meeting 
immediate energy needs, and minimizing 
our operational impact. In 2022, we 
financed and facilitated $197 billion 
toward our $2.5 trillion Sustainable 
Development Target: $70 billion toward 
green, $87 billion toward development 
finance and $40 billion toward community development. Through 2022, we 
have financed and facilitated $482 
billion toward this overall target, 
including $176 billion toward our 
$1 trillion green target. 
We also announced 2030 emissions 
intensity reduction targets for three new 
key sectors: iron and steel, cement and 
aviation. The aggregate of these new 
sectors, along with the sectors we 
announced in 2021, accounts for the 
majority of global emissions across both 
the supply and demand sides in the 
global energy system — a key consideration for advancing overall decarbonization and the global path to net-zero 
emissions.
We recognize that climate change has a 
domino effect on communities, with 
extreme weather impacting roughly one 
in 10 homes in the United States. In 
response, we’re supporting programs 
that aim to scale climate-resilient affordable housing models, particularly in 
Black, Hispanic and Latino communities, 
including in rural areas. Our most recent 
$15 million philanthropic commitment 
will help produce or preserve more than 
1,400 units of affordable housing, incorporating energy-efficient features and 
weatherization upgrades that offer 
protection against extreme weather 
and reduce utility costs.
Driving inclusive economic growth
Investing in the careers of tomorrow
As rapid changes in technology, automation and artificial intelligence alter 
career paths, it is imperative for companies like ours to transform how we prepare people to compete for well-paying 
jobs. Since 2018, we’ve supported the 
Dallas County Promise, a program helping Dallas County Public School students 
access postsecondary education opportunities at local colleges and universities. 
Today, more than 90,000 high school 
seniors in the Dallas area have benefited. 
This model is being scaled across the 
state, with the potential to serve 5% of 
the nation’s high school seniors. It is 
even influencing legislation to help 
districts prepare students for college 
and encourage high schoolers to apply 
for federal financial aid before they 
graduate. Supporting this impactful 
program is part of our five-year, $350 
million commitment to equip people 
with the skills they need for the future 
of work and to meet the growing 
demand for qualified workers.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
Supporting small business growth
Small businesses generate jobs and are 
vital to driving local economic growth. 
In the past year, we have assisted more 
than 26,500 small businesses around 
the world, helping them create or retain 
more than 54,000 jobs and increase 
revenue by over $129 million. Our 
employees have been central to this 
effort, committing 7,000+ volunteer 
hours globally through our Founders 
Forward small business mentorship program. The program pairs entrepreneurs 
with JPMorgan Chase team members to 
receive consultative support on various 
business challenges, covering leadership, financial modeling, e-commerce, 
marketing and more. 
We also help entrepreneurs succeed 
through our support of Ascend, a nationwide program focused on developing 
customized growth strategies for small 
businesses. Eighty-nine percent of participating businesses are owned by people 
of color, and this year these businesses 
surpassed $2 billion in contracts. As a 
result of Ascend’s specialized approach, 
participating entrepreneurs are able to 
focus on trainings most relevant to them. 
In New York City, for example, Salsa 
Hospitality CEO Daniel Garcia learned 
how to grow his executive team, plan 
for long-term business expansion and 
purchase a new facility to accommodate 
business growth, ultimately increasing 
sales by 56% in 2022.
Catalyzing community development
Economic opportunity is deeply rooted in 
neighborhoods. We saw this firsthand in 
Syracuse, New York, where a declining 
manufacturing sector contributed to an 
economic downturn, job loss and population decrease. As one of the inaugural 
winners of our annual AdvancingCities 
Challenge, a yearly competition that 
promotes community-driven solutions 
to advance local inclusive growth, we 
provided $3 million over three years 
and ongoing coaching to help drive 
technological development in the city’s 
workforce, neighborhoods and small 
businesses and to boost its economy. 
With our support, the city of Syracuse 
piloted and evolved its Community 
Investment Framework, ultimately 
attracting significant public and private 
sector investments. According to the city, 
these investments are creating nearly 
50,000 jobs, generating almost $600 
million in annual tax revenue for New 
York state and spurring an additional 
$500 million in public and private sector 
funding that will help scale opportunities 
and create economic growth for residents in Syracuse’s underserved 
communities.
Promoting financial health and wealth 
creation
Policies, programs and products aimed 
at improving financial health are key to 
creating more inclusive economies. 
Through our support of innovative, inclusive fintech accelerators — the Financial 
Inclusion Lab, the Financial Solutions Lab 
and the Catalyst Fund — we are helping 
advance the financial well-being of 
underserved low- and middle-income 
populations. The Labs provide capital, 
mentorship and additional assistance to 
create scalable fintech solutions that 
enable communities to build wealth, save 
money and reduce debt. 
In India, the Financial Inclusion Lab has 
supported 50 early-stage startups, 
serving more than 30 million consumers 
who need access to savings, credit and 
insurance services and raising over $80 
million in follow-up funding to continue 
their work. In the United States, Financial 
Solutions Lab participants have helped 
more than 33 million consumers. And 
in emerging markets like Nigeria, the 
Catalyst Fund has supported 61 startups, 
helping more than 14 million customers 
build savings, learn to invest and more 
easily access credit.
Extending support in times of crisis
We show up for the communities we 
serve in both good and tough times. Over 
the last three years, we’ve contributed 
more than $33 million for disaster relief 
through corporate donations and 
employee personal donations. We’ve 
provided support to communities through 
hardships of all kinds, from catastrophic 
earthquakes in Haiti, Türkiye and Syria 
to the cost-of-living crisis in the United 
Kingdom and tragic violence in neighborhoods spanning the United States. 
But in many cases, impacted communities need more than financial support. 
When Jackson, Mississippi, a city with 
more than 140,000 residents, experienced periodic water shutdowns and boil 
orders due to burst pipes and high lead 
levels, our team worked closely with 
community organizations responding 
to the crisis, hosting a local training for 
nonprofits working on recovery plans 
while also distributing resources like 
bottled water. This is just one example 
of how we’re bringing our expertise and 
resources to Mississippi as our business 
in the state continues to grow.

Firmwide overview

2022, down 22%, earnings per share of $12.09, ROE of 
14% and ROTCE of 18%. 
• Total net revenue was $128.7 billion, up 6%, reflecting: 
– Net interest income of $66.7 billion, up 28%, driven by 
higher rates and loan growth, partially offset by lower 
Markets net interest income. Net interest income 
excluding Markets was $62.4 billion, up 40%. 
– Noninterest revenue of $62.0 billion, down 11%, 
driven by lower Investment Banking fees, $2.4 billion 
of net investment securities losses in Treasury and CIO, 
lower net production revenue in Home Lending and 
lower auto operating lease income, largely offset by 
higher CIB Markets revenue and a $914 million gain on 
the sale of Visa Class B common shares (“Visa B 
shares”) in Corporate.
• Noninterest expense was $76.1 billion, up 7%, driven by 
higher structural expense and continued investments in 
the business, including compensation, technology and 
marketing, partially offset by lower volume- and revenuerelated expense. 
• The provision for credit losses was $6.4 billion, 
reflecting: 
– a net addition of $3.5 billion to the allowance for credit 
losses, consisting of $2.3 billion in wholesale and $1.2 
billion in consumer, driven by loan growth and 
deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, 
partially offset by a reduction in the allowance related 
to a decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower 
behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually 
recede, and
– $2.9 billion of net charge-offs.
The prior year provision was a net benefit of $9.3 billion, 
reflecting a net reduction to the allowance for credit 
losses of $12.1 billion.
• The total allowance for credit losses was $22.2 billion at 
December 31, 2022. The Firm had an allowance for loan 
losses to retained loans coverage ratio of 1.81%, 
compared with 1.62% in the prior year.
• The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $7.2 billion at 
December 31, 2022, a net decrease of $1.1 billion, 
predominantly driven by lower consumer nonaccrual 
loans, reflecting improved credit performance and loan 
sales.
• Firmwide average loans of $1.1 trillion were up 6%, 
driven by higher loans across the LOBs.
• Firmwide average deposits of $2.5 trillion were up 5%, 
reflecting: 
– growth in CCB from existing and new accounts, and net 
inflows in AWM resulting from the residual effects of 
certain government actions, partially offset by the 
impact of growth in customer spending in CCB and 
migration into investments in AWM, and
– reductions in CIB and CB due to attrition driven by the 
rising interest rate environment. 
Selected capital and other metrics
• CET1 capital was $219 billion, and the Standardized and 
Advanced CET1 ratios were 13.2% and 13.6%, 
respectively.
• SLR was 5.6%.
• TBVPS grew by 2%, ending 2022 at $73.12.

JPMorgan Chase’s current outlook for full-year 2023 should 
be viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S. 
economies, financial markets activity, the geopolitical 
environment, the competitive environment, client and 
customer activity levels, and regulatory and legislative 
developments in the U.S. and other countries where the 
Firm does business. Each of these factors will affect the

appropriate adjustments to its businesses and operations in 
response to ongoing developments in the business, 
economic, regulatory and legal environments in which it 
operates.

approximately $73 billion, market dependent. 
• Management expects net interest income excluding 
Markets to be approximately $74 billion, market 
dependent.

Business Developments
War in Ukraine
The duration and potential outcomes of the war in Ukraine 
remain uncertain. The Firm has taken and continues to take 
steps to close positions and reduce certain of its business 
activities and exposures connected with the war, and to 
assist clients with fulfilling any pre-existing obligations and 
managing their Russia-related risks.
The Firm’s exposure to Russia and Russia-associated clients 
and counterparties is not material to its financial condition 
or results of operations. However, the Firm continues to 
monitor potential secondary impacts of the war, including 
increased market volatility, inflationary pressures and the 
effects of financial and economic sanctions imposed by 
various governments, that could have adverse effects on the 
Firm’s businesses.
The Firm also continues to monitor and manage the 
operational risks associated with the war, including 
compliance with the financial and economic sanctions and 
the increased risk of cyber attacks.
Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 116-126, 
Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 127-129, Market Risk 
Management on pages 131-138, Country Risk Management 
on pages 139-140 and Operational Risk Management on 
pages 142-144 for additional information.
For purposes of this Form 10-K, “Russia” refers to exposure 
to clients and counterparties of the Firm for which the 
largest proportion of their assets is located, or the largest 
proportion of their revenue is derived, in Russia, based on 
the Firm’s internal country risk management framework; and 
“Russia-associated” refers to exposure to clients and 
counterparties of the Firm with respect to which economic or 
financial sanctions relating to the war in Ukraine have been 
imposed or which have close association with Russia.
Interbank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) transition 
The Firm and other market participants are preparing for the 
final stages of the transition from the use of the London 
Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other IBORs in 
accordance with the International Organization of Securities 
Commission’s standards for transaction-based benchmark 
rates. The cessation of the publication of the remaining 
principal tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR (i.e., overnight, onemonth, three-month, six-month and 12-month LIBOR) 
(“LIBOR Cessation”) is scheduled for June 30, 2023.
As of December 31, 2022, the Firm had significantly reduced 
the notional amount of its exposure to contracts that 
reference U.S. dollar LIBOR, including in derivatives, bilateral 
and syndicated loans, securities, and debt and preferred 
stock issuances, and is on-track to meet both its internal 
milestones for contract remediation as well as the industry 
milestones and recommendations published by National 
Working Groups, including the Alternative Reference Rates 
Committee in the U.S. The Firm also continues to engage 
with clients to assist them with transitioning their U.S. dollar 
LIBOR-linked contracts to replacement rates in anticipation 
of LIBOR Cessation. The majority of the Firm’s remaining 
LIBOR exposure is to derivative contracts. The Firm will be 
participating in initiatives by the principal central 
counterparties (“CCPs”) to convert cleared derivatives 
contracts linked to U.S. dollar LIBOR in the second quarter of 
2023 which will remediate approximately 40% of the Firm’s 
remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR derivatives exposure. The Firm 
expects that the majority of the remaining derivatives 
exposure will be remediated predominantly through 
contractual fallback provisions.
On March 15, 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act 
(“LIBOR Act”) was signed into law in the U.S. The LIBOR Act 
provides a framework for replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR as the 
reference rate in legacy financial contracts that may not 
otherwise transition to a replacement rate upon LIBOR 
Cessation. In addition, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority is 
proposing that the administrator of LIBOR be required to 
continue to publish the one-month, three-month and sixmonth tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR on a “synthetic” basis 
which would allow market participants to use such rates 
through September 30, 2024. This proposal would apply to 
contracts that are outside the scope of the LIBOR Act, 
including U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked contracts that are not 
governed by U.S. law. Both the LIBOR Act and the proposed 
publication of “synthetic” LIBOR are intended to facilitate, 
and reduce the risks associated with, the transition from 
LIBOR, including the potential for disputes or litigation.
The Firm continues to make necessary changes to its risk 
management systems in connection with the transition from 
LIBOR, including modifications to its operational systems and 
models. In addition, the Firm continues to monitor and 
evaluate client, industry, market, regulatory and legislative 
developments relating to the transition from LIBOR. Refer to 
Part 1, Item 1A: Risk Factors on pages 9-32 of the 2022 
Form 10-K and to Accounting and Reporting Developments 
on page 153 for additional information.

respectively. Also includes losses on tax-oriented investments. Refer to 
Note 6 for additional information.
2022 compared with 2021
Investment banking fees decreased in CIB, as volatile 
market conditions resulted in:
• lower equity and debt underwriting fees due to lower 
issuance activity, and
• lower advisory fees driven by a lower level of announced 
deals.
Refer to CIB segment results on pages 67-72 and Note 6 for 
additional information.
Principal transactions revenue increased, reflecting:
• higher net revenue in Fixed Income Markets, driven by a 
strong performance in the macro businesses amid volatile 
market conditions, particularly Currencies & Emerging 
Markets and Rates, partially offset by lower revenue in 
Securitized Products and Credit, and
• higher revenue associated with Equity Derivatives and 
Prime Finance in Equity Markets,
largely offset by
• a loss of $836 million in Credit Adjustments & Other in 
CIB, compared with a gain of $250 million in the prior 
year. The loss in the current year reflected funding 
spread widening and, to a lesser extent, losses on 
exposures relating to commodities and Russia and Russiaassociated counterparties, 
• net markdowns recorded in the second quarter of 2022 
on held-for-sale positions, primarily unfunded 
commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio in CIB and 
CB,
• higher net losses on certain legacy private equity 
investments in Corporate, and
• net losses in Treasury and CIO related to cash deployment 
transactions, which were more than offset by the related 
net interest income earned on those transactions.
Principal transactions revenue in CIB may in certain cases 
have offsets across other revenue lines, including net 
interest income. The Firm assesses the performance of its 
CIB Markets business on a total revenue basis.
Refer to CIB, CB and Corporate segment results on pages 
67-72, pages 73-75 and pages 79-80, respectively, and 
Note 6 for additional information.
Lending- and deposit-related fees increased due to higher 
service fee volume in CCB, predominantly offset by lower 
cash management fees in CB and CIB due to a higher level 
of credits earned by clients and applied against such fees. 
Refer to CCB, CIB and CB segment results on pages 63-66, 
pages 67-72 and pages 73-75, respectively, and Note 6 for 
additional information.
Asset management, administration and commissions 
revenue decreased driven by:
• lower asset management fees in AWM resulting from 
lower average market levels, predominantly offset by the 
removal of most money market fund fee waivers, and net 
long-term inflows,
• lower custody fees in Securities Services, primarily 
associated with lower average market values of assets 
under custody, and
• lower brokerage commissions, largely in AWM, reflecting 
reduced volumes,
partially offset by
• higher commissions on travel-related services and 
annuity sales in CCB.
Refer to CCB, CIB and AWM segment results on pages 
63-66, pages 67-72 and pages 76-78, respectively, and 
Note 6 for additional information. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Investment securities gains/(losses) reflected higher net 
losses on sales of U.S. GSE and government agency MBS and 
U.S. Treasuries, associated with repositioning the 
investment securities portfolio in Treasury and CIO. Refer to 
Corporate segment results on pages 79-80 and Note 10 for 
additional information.
Mortgage fees and related income decreased driven by 
Home Lending, reflecting:
• lower production revenue due to lower margins and 
volume,
largely offset by 
• higher net mortgage servicing revenue, reflecting
– the absence of a net loss in MSR risk management in 
the prior year primarily driven by updates to model 
inputs related to prepayment expectations, and
– higher operating revenue due to a higher level of thirdparty loans serviced.
Refer to CCB segment results on pages 63-66, Note 6 and 
15 for further information.
Card income decreased driven by higher amortization 
related to new account origination costs, partially offset by 
higher annual fees in CCB, and higher payments revenue on 
volume growth in commercial cards in CIB and CB.
Refer to CCB, CIB and CB segment results on pages 63-66, 
pages 67-72 and pages 73-75, respectively, and Note 6 for 
further information.
Other income decreased reflecting:
• lower auto operating lease income in CCB as a result of a 
decline in volume, and
• net losses on certain investments in CIB and AWM, 
compared with net gains in the prior year,
partially offset by
• an increase in Other Corporate from:
– a gain of $914M on the sale of Visa B shares,
– higher net gains related to certain other investments, 
and
– proceeds from an insurance settlement in the first 
quarter of 2022,
• a gain on an equity-method investment received in partial 
satisfaction of a loan in CB,
• the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates 
related to net investment hedges in Treasury and CIO, 
primarily as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. 
dollar, and
• the absence of weather-related write-downs recorded in 
the prior year on certain renewable energy investments 
in CIB.
Refer to Note 2 for additional information on Visa B shares.
Net interest income increased driven by higher rates and 
loan growth, partially offset by lower Markets NII. 
The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.3 
trillion, up $133 billion, and the yield was 2.78%, up 97 
basis points (“bps”). The net yield on these assets, on an 
FTE basis, was 2.00%, an increase of 36 bps. The net yield 
excluding Markets was 2.60%, up 69 bps.
Refer to the Consolidated average balance sheets, interest 
and rates schedule on pages 292-296 for further 
information. Net yield excluding Markets is a non-GAAP 
financial measure. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation 
of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 
58-60 for a further discussion of Net yield excluding 
Markets.

Total provision for credit losses

$ (9,256) $ 17,480 
2022 compared with 2021
The provision for credit losses was $6.4 billion, reflecting a 
net addition of $3.5 billion to the allowance for credit 
losses and $2.9 billion of net charge-offs. The net addition 
to the allowance for credit losses consisted of:
• $2.3 billion in wholesale, driven by deterioration in the 
Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, and loan growth 
predominantly in CB and CIB, and
• $1.2 billion in consumer, predominantly driven by Card 
Services, reflecting higher outstanding balances and 
deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, 
partially offset by a reduction in the allowance related to 
a decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower 
behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede.
The prior year included a $12.1 billion net reduction in the 
allowance for credit losses. 
Deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook included 
both updates to the central scenario in the fourth quarter of 
2022, which now reflects a mild recession, as well as the 
impact of the increased weight placed on the adverse 
scenarios beginning in the first quarter of 2022 due to the 
effects associated with higher inflation, changes in 
monetary policy, and geopolitical risks, including the war in 
Ukraine.
Net charge-offs were $2.9 billion, flat compared with 2021, 
and included:
• a $309 million decrease in Card Services, reflecting the 
ongoing financial strength of U.S. consumers. However, 
median deposit balances declined in the second half of 
2022, impacted by the growth in consumer spending, 
offset by 
• a $190 million increase in net charge-offs in Auto and 
Banking & Wealth Management (“BWM”) as net chargeoffs in the prior year benefited from government stimulus 
and payment assistance programs, and an increase of 
$76 million in CIB.
Refer to the segment discussions of CCB on pages 63-66, 
CIB on pages 67-72, CB on pages 73-75, AWM on pages

$1.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, 
respectively.
2022 compared with 2021
Compensation expense increased driven by additional 
headcount, primarily in technology and operations, as well 
as front office, and the impact of inflation, partially offset 
by lower revenue-related compensation in CIB.
Noncompensation expense increased as a result of:
• higher investments in the business, including marketing 
and technology, and
• higher structural expense, including travel and 
entertainment; regulatory assessments; occupancy 
expense associated with higher utilities and exit costs of 
certain leases; and other employee-related expense,
partially offset by
• lower volume-related expense, reflecting lower 
depreciation expense on lower Auto lease assets; and 
lower distribution fees in AWM, partially offset by higher 
operating losses and outside services, both in CCB; and
• lower legal expense.
The prior year included a $550 million contribution to the 
Firm's Foundation.

tax adjustments and a change in the level and mix of 
income and expenses subject to U.S. federal and state and 
local taxes. Refer to Note 25 for further information.

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks 
decreased primarily as a result of lower deposits across the 
LOBs and loan growth. Deposits with banks reflect the Firm’s 
placement of its excess cash with various central banks, 
including the Federal Reserve Banks.
Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale 
agreements increased, reflecting:
• the impact of a lower level of netting on client-driven 
market-making activities and on collateral requirements in 
Markets,
• higher demand for securities to cover short positions in 
Fixed Income Markets, and
• an increase in the deployment of cash in Treasury and CIO.
Securities borrowed decreased driven by Markets, reflecting 
lower client-driven activities and lower demand for securities 
to cover short positions in Equity Markets.
Refer to Note 11 for additional information on securities 
purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed.
Trading assets increased due to: 
• higher derivative receivables, primarily in foreign 
exchange, as a result of market movements, and
• an increase in the deployment of cash in Treasury and CIO.
Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for additional information.
Investment securities decreased, driven by lower availablefor-sale (“AFS”) securities, partially offset by higher held-tomaturity (“HTM”) securities, which includes the impact of the 
transfer of $78.3 billion of securities from AFS to HTM in 
2022, for capital management purposes.
• The decrease in AFS securities was also due to paydowns, 
as well as unrealized losses, which are recognized in 
accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), 
largely offset by net purchases, and 
• the increase in HTM securities also reflected purchases 
partially offset by paydowns.
Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 79-80, 
Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 130 and 
Notes 2 and 10 for additional information on investment 
securities.
Loans increased, reflecting:
• higher balances in Card Services driven by higher 
consumer spending and net new originations,
• higher originations and revolver utilization in CB, and
• higher wholesale loans in CIB,
partially offset by
• lower mortgage warehouse loans in Home Lending as sales 
outpaced originations due to higher interest rates, and
• the impact from PPP loan forgiveness in BWM.
The allowance for loan losses increased, reflecting a net 
addition of $3.3 billion to the allowance for loan losses, 
consisting of:
• $2.1 billion in wholesale, resulting from deterioration in 
the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, and loan growth 
predominantly in CB and CIB, and
• $1.2 billion in consumer, predominantly driven by Card 
Services, reflecting higher outstanding balances, and 
deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, 
partially offset by a reduction in the allowance related to a 
decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower behavior 
as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede.
There was also a $121 million addition to the allowance for 
lending-related commitments recognized in other liabilities 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

on the Consolidated balance sheets, and a $54 million 
addition to the allowance for investment securities.
Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 
106-130, and Notes 1, 2, 3, 12 and 13 for further discussion 
of loans and the allowance for loan losses.
Accrued interest and accounts receivable increased due to 
higher client receivables related to client-driven activities in 
Markets, as well as higher receivables in Payments related to 
the timing of payment activities, with December 31, 2022 
falling on a weekend.
Premises and equipment, refer to Note 16 and 18 for 
additional information.
Goodwill, MSRs and other intangibles increased reflecting:
• higher MSRs as a result of higher market interest rates and 
net additions, partially offset by the realization of expected 
cash flows, and
• additions to goodwill associated with the acquisitions of 
Renovite Technologies, Inc. in the fourth quarter of 2022, 
Global Shares PLC and Figg, Inc. in the third quarter of 
2022, and Frosch Travel Group, LLC and Volkswagen 
Payments S.A. in the second quarter of 2022.
Refer to Note 15 for additional information.
Other assets increased predominantly due to the impact of 
securities financing activities in Markets, offset by lower auto 
operating lease assets in CCB.

Deposits decreased reflecting:
• attrition in CB and CIB, particularly non-operating deposits 
in CB, partially offset by net issuances of structured notes 
in Markets,
• net outflows into investments in AWM amid the rising 
interest rate environment, and
• a decline in balances in existing accounts in CCB due to 
higher customer spending, predominantly offset by net 
inflows into new accounts.
Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold 
under repurchase agreements increased due to:
• higher secured financing of trading assets in Markets,
partially offset by
• lower secured financing of AFS investment securities in 
Treasury and CIO.
Short-term borrowings decreased predominantly as a result 
of lower financing requirements in Markets. 
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 for 
additional information on deposits, federal funds purchased 
and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, 
and short-term borrowings; and also to Notes 2 and 17 for 
deposits and Note 11 for federal funds purchased and 
securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements.
Trading liabilities increased due to client-driven marketmaking activities, which resulted in higher levels of short 
positions in Markets. Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for additional 
information.
Accounts payable and other liabilities increased due to 
higher client payables related to client-driven activities in 
Markets, including Prime Finance, as well as higher payables 
in Payments related to the timing of payment activities, with 
December 31, 2022 falling on a weekend. Refer to Note 19 
for additional information.
Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs increased 
driven by higher issuance of commercial paper as a result of 
an increase in loan balances in the Firm-administered multiseller conduits. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 
97-104; and Notes 14 and 28 for additional information on 
Firm-sponsored VIEs and loan securitization trusts.
Long-term debt decreased driven by:
• fair value hedge accounting adjustments in Treasury and 
CIO as a result of higher rates, and a decline in the fair 
value of structured notes in Markets, 
largely offset by
• net issuances of senior debt in Treasury and CIO and 
structured notes in Markets. Refer to Liquidity Risk 
Management on pages 97-104 and Note 20 for additional 
information.
Stockholders’ equity reflects net unrealized losses in AOCI, 
predominantly driven by the impact of higher interest rates 
on the AFS portfolio and cash flow hedges in Treasury and 
CIO. Refer to Consolidated Statements of Changes in 
Stockholders’ Equity on page 162, Capital Actions on page 
94, and Note 24 for additional information.

Operating activities 
JPMorgan Chase’s operating assets and liabilities primarily 
support the Firm’s lending and capital markets activities. 
These assets and liabilities can vary significantly in the 
normal course of business due to the amount and timing of 
cash flows, which are affected by client-driven and risk 
management activities and market conditions. The Firm 
believes that cash flows from operations, available cash and 
other liquidity sources, and its capacity to generate cash 
through secured and unsecured sources, are sufficient to 
meet its operating liquidity needs.
• In 2022, cash provided resulted from higher accounts 
payable and other liabilities, lower securities borrowed, 
and net proceeds from sales, securitizations, and 
paydowns of loans held-for-sale, partially offset by higher 
trading assets.
• In 2021, cash provided resulted from lower trading 
assets and higher accounts payable and other liabilities, 
partially offset by higher securities borrowed and lower 
trading liabilities.
Investing activities
The Firm’s investing activities predominantly include 
originating held-for-investment loans, investing in the 
investment securities portfolio and other short-term 
instruments.
• In 2022, cash used resulted from net originations of 
loans and higher securities purchased under resale 
agreements, partially offset by net proceeds from 
investment securities.
• In 2021, cash used resulted from net purchases of 
investment securities and higher net originations of 
loans, partially offset by lower securities purchased under 
resale agreements.
Financing activities
The Firm’s financing activities include acquiring customer 
deposits and issuing long-term debt and preferred stock.
• In 2022, cash used reflected lower deposits, partially 
offset by net proceeds from long- and short-term 
borrowings.
• In 2021, cash provided reflected higher deposits and net 
proceeds from long- and short-term borrowings, partially 
offset by a decrease in securities loaned or sold under 
repurchase agreements.
• For both periods, cash was used for repurchases of 
common stock and cash dividends on common and 
preferred stock.

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Non-GAAP financial measures
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in 
accordance with U.S. GAAP; these financial statements 
appear on pages 159-163. That presentation, which is 
referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an 
understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked 
consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of 
the Firm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial 
statements of other companies.
In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported 
basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the 
overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide 
managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. 
The Firm also reviews the results of the LOBs on a managed 
basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each 
case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes 
certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the 
Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an 
FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that 
receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in 
the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable 
investments and securities. These financial measures allow 
management to assess the comparability of revenue from 
year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt 
sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to 
tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. 
These adjustments have no impact on net income as 
reported by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs.
Management also uses certain non-GAAP financial 
measures at the Firm and business-segment level because 
these other non-GAAP financial measures provide 
information to investors about the underlying operational 
performance and trends of the Firm or of the particular 
business segment, as the case may be, and therefore 
facilitate a comparison of the Firm or the business segment 
with the performance of its relevant competitors. Refer to 
Business Segment Results on pages 61-80 for additional 
information on these non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP 
financial measures used by the Firm may not be 
comparable to similarly named non-GAAP financial 
measures used by other companies. 
The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm’s reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.

Management’s discussion and analysis

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Net interest income, net yield, and noninterest revenue 
excluding CIB Markets
In addition to reviewing net interest income, net yield, and 
noninterest revenue on a managed basis, management also 
reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets, as shown 
below. CIB Markets consists of Fixed Income Markets and 
Equity Markets. These metrics, which exclude CIB Markets, 
are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews 
these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s 
lending, investing (including asset-liability management) 
and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility 
associated with CIB Markets activities. In addition, 
management also assesses CIB Markets business 
performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur 
across revenue lines. Management believes that these 
measures provide investors and analysts with alternative 
measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm.

Calculation of certain U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures
Certain U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are calculated as 
follows:
Book value per share (“BVPS”)
Common stockholders’ equity at period-end /
Common shares at period-end
Overhead ratio
Total noninterest expense / Total net revenue
ROA
Reported net income / Total average assets
ROE
Net income* / Average common stockholders’ equity
ROTCE
Net income* / Average tangible common equity
TBVPS
Tangible common equity at period-end / Common shares at period-end
* Represents net income applicable to common equity
In addition, the Firm reviews other non-GAAP measures 
such as 
• Adjusted expense, which represents noninterest expense 
excluding Firmwide legal expense, and
• Pre-provision profit, which represents total net revenue 
less total noninterest expense.
Management believes that these measures help investors 
understand the effect of these items on reported results 
and provide an alternative presentation of the Firm’s 
performance.
The Firm also reviews the allowance for loan losses to 
period-end loans retained excluding trade finance and 
conduits, a non-GAAP financial measure, to provide a more 
meaningful assessment of CIB’s allowance coverage ratio.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS
TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., 
total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related 
deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. 
TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by 
the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. 
The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity to TCE.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major reportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking, 
Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate 
segment. 
The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they 
reflect the manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are 
presented on a managed basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, on 
pages 58-60 for a definition of managed basis.

Description of business segment reporting methodology 
Results of the business segments are intended to present 
each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The 
management reporting process that derives business 
segment results includes the allocation of certain income 
and expense items. The Firm also assesses the level of 
capital required for each LOB on at least an annual basis. 
The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions, 
methodologies and reporting classifications used for 
segment reporting, and further refinements may be 
implemented in future periods. The Firm’s LOBs also 
provide various business metrics which are utilized by the 
Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing 
performance.
Revenue sharing 
When business segments join efforts to sell products and 
services to the Firm’s clients and customers, the 
participating business segments may agree to share 
revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally 
recognized in the segment responsible for the related 
product or service, with allocations to the other segment(s) 
involved in the transaction. The segment results reflect 
these revenue-sharing agreements.
Expense Allocation
Where business segments use services provided by 
corporate support units, or another business segment, the 
costs of those services are allocated to the respective 
business segments. The expense is generally 
allocated based on the actual cost and use of services 
provided. In contrast, certain costs and investments related 
to corporate support units, technology and operations that 
are not currently utilized by any LOB, are not allocated to 
the business segments and are retained in Corporate. 
Expense retained in Corporate generally includes costs that 
would not be incurred if the segments were stand-alone 
businesses, and other items not aligned with a particular 
business segment.
Funds transfer pricing 
Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which the 
Firm allocates interest income and expense to the LOBs and 
Other Corporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk 
and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO.
The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest 
rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities 
and off-balance sheet products. Periodically, the 
methodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP process 
are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other 
factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest 
income to the segments.
As a result of the rising interest rate environment, the cost 
of funds for assets and the credits earned for liabilities have 
generally increased, impacting the business segments’ net 
interest income. During the period ended December 31, 
2022, this has resulted in higher cost of funds for loans and 
contributed to margin expansion on deposits.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and 
Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain revenues 
and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these risks 
centrally and reports the impact of foreign exchange rate 
movements related to the transferred risk in its results. 
Refer to Market Risk Management on page 137 for 
additional information.
Debt expense and preferred stock dividend allocation
As part of the funds transfer pricing process, almost all of 
the cost of the credit spread component of outstanding 
unsecured long-term debt and preferred stock dividends is 
allocated to the reportable business segments, while the 
balance of the cost is retained in Corporate. The 
methodology to allocate the cost of unsecured long-term 
debt and preferred stock dividends to the business 
segments is aligned with the relevant regulatory capital 
requirements and funding needs of the LOBs, as applicable. 
The allocated cost of unsecured long-term debt is included 
in a business segment’s net interest income, and net income 
is reduced by preferred stock dividends to arrive at a 
business segment’s net income applicable to common 
equity. 
Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for 
additional information.
Capital allocation 
The amount of capital assigned to each business segment is 
referred to as equity. The Firm’s allocation methodology 
incorporates Basel III Standardized Risk-weighted assets 
(“RWA”), Basel III Advanced RWA, the global systemically 
important banks (“GSIB”) surcharge, and a simulation of 
capital in a severe stress environment. At least annually, 
the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to 
allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital 
allocated to the LOBs may change. As of January 1, 2023, 
the Firm has changed its line of business capital allocations 
primarily as a result of updates to the Firm’s capital 
requirements and changes in RWA for each LOB. 
Refer to Line of business equity on page 93 for additional 
information on capital allocation.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

2022 compared with 2021 
Net income was $14.9 billion, down 29%, reflecting a net 
increase in the provision for credit losses compared with a 
net benefit in the prior year.
Net revenue was $55.0 billion, an increase of 10%.
Net interest income was $39.9 billion, up 22%, 
predominantly driven by:
• margin expansion on higher rates as well as growth in 
deposits in Banking & Wealth Management (“BWM”), and 
higher revolving loans in Card Services,
partially offset by
• lower NII associated with PPP loan forgiveness in BWM, 
and tighter loan spreads in Home Lending. 
Noninterest revenue was $15.1 billion, down 13%, 
reflecting:
• lower production revenue from lower margins and 
volume in Home Lending,
• lower auto operating lease income as a result of a decline 
in volume, and
• lower card income reflecting higher amortization related 
to new account origination costs partially offset by higher 
annual fees in Card Services, while net interchange 
income was relatively flat,
partially offset by
• higher net mortgage servicing revenue, reflecting the 
absence of a net loss in MSR risk management in the prior 
year primarily driven by updates to model inputs related 
to prepayment expectations, as well as higher operating 
revenue on a higher level of third-party loans serviced,
• higher commissions reflecting travel-related services in 
Card Services and increased annuity sales in BWM, and
• higher deposit-related fees due to higher service fee 
volume in BWM.
Refer to Note 6 for additional information on card income 
and asset management, administration and commissions. 
Refer to Note 15 for further information regarding changes 
in the value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and 
mortgage fees and related income.
Noninterest expense was $31.5 billion, up 8%, reflecting:
• investments in the business and higher structural 
expenses, predominantly driven by compensation, 
technology and marketing, 
 partially offset by
• lower volume- and revenue-related expenses, 
predominantly driven by lower depreciation expense on 
lower auto lease assets, partially offset by higher 
operating losses.
The provision for credit losses was $3.8 billion, driven by:
• net charge-offs of $2.7 billion, down from $2.8 billion in 
the prior year and included
– a $309 million decrease in Card Services, reflecting the 
ongoing financial strength of U.S. consumers. However, 
median deposit balances declined in the second half of 
2022, impacted by the growth in consumer spending,
largely offset by
– a $190 million increase in net charge-offs in Auto and 
BWM as net charge-offs in the prior year benefited 
from government stimulus and payment assistance 
programs, and
• a $1.1 billion net addition to the allowance for credit 
losses driven by
– $950 million in Card Services, reflecting higher 
outstanding balances, and deterioration in the Firm’s 
macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reduction 
in the allowance related to a decrease in uncertainty 
associated with borrower behavior as the effects of the 
pandemic gradually recede, and
– $175 million in Home Lending.
The prior year included a $9.8 billion reduction in the
allowance for credit losses across CCB.
Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 
106-130 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 
127-129 for a further discussion of the credit portfolios 
and the allowance for credit losses.

(a) At December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, nonaccrual loans excluded 
mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. 
government agencies of $187 million, $342 million and $558 million, 
respectively. These amounts have been excluded based upon the 
government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to 
exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as 
permitted by regulatory guidance.
(b) At December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, generally excludes loans that 
were under payment deferral programs offered in response to the

further information on consumer assistance. Includes loans to 
customers that have exited COVID-19 related payment deferral 
programs and are 90 or more days past due, predominantly all of which 
were considered collateral-dependent at time of exit.
(c) At December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, included $350 million, $5.4 
billion and $19.2 billion of loans, respectively, in Business Banking

losses on PPP loans because the loans are guaranteed by the SBA. Refer 
to Credit Portfolio on pages 108-109 for a further discussion of the PPP.
(d) At December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the principal balance of loans 
under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic was $449 million, $1.1 billion and $9.1 billion in Home 
Lending, respectively. Loans that are performing according to their 
modified terms are generally not considered delinquent. Refer to Credit 
Portfolio on pages 108-109 for further information on consumer 
assistance.
(e) At December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, excluded mortgage loans 
insured by U.S. government agencies of $258 million, $405 million and 
$744 million, respectively, that are 30 or more days past due. These 
amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee.
(f) At December 31, 2022 and 2021, nonaccrual loans excluded $101

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

2022 compared with 2021
Net income was $15.0 billion, down 29%.
Net revenue was $47.9 billion, down 7%.
Banking revenue was $15.3 billion, down 23%.
• Investment Banking revenue was $6.5 billion, down 48%, 
driven by lower Investment Banking fees, which were also 
down 48%, as volatile market conditions resulted in 
lower fees across products, and $251 million of 
markdowns on held-for-sale positions, primarily 
unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio 
in the second quarter of 2022. The Firm ranked #1 for 
Global Investment Banking fees, according to Dealogic.
– Equity underwriting fees were $1.0 billion, down 74%, 
and debt underwriting fees were $2.8 billion, down 
43%, due to lower issuance activity. 
– Advisory fees were $3.1 billion, down 30%, driven by a 
lower level of announced deals.
• Payments revenue was $7.4 billion, up 18%, and 
included the net impact of equity investments. Excluding 
this net impact, revenue was $7.8 billion, up 33%, driven 
by deposit margin expansion on higher rates and growth 
in fees on higher volumes.
• Lending revenue was $1.4 billion, up 38%, driven by 
higher net interest income primarily on higher loans, as 
well as fair value gains on hedges of retained loans, 
compared with losses in the prior year.
Markets & Securities Services revenue was $32.6 billion, up 
2%. Markets revenue was $29.0 billion, up 6%.
• Fixed Income Markets revenue was $18.6 billion, up 
10%, driven by strong performance in the macro 
businesses amid volatile market conditions, particularly 
in Currencies & Emerging Markets and Rates, partially 
offset by lower revenue in Securitized Products.
• Equity Markets revenue was $10.4 billion, down 2%, 
driven by lower revenue in Cash Equities, largely offset by 
Equity Derivatives.
• Securities Services revenue was $4.5 billion, up 4%, 
driven by deposit margin expansion on higher rates and 
growth in fees, largely offset by lower average market 
values of assets under custody and lower deposits.
• Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $836 million, 
reflecting funding spread widening, and, to a lesser 
extent, losses on exposures relating to commodities and 
Russia and Russia-associated counterparties, compared 
with a gain of $250 million in the prior year.
Noninterest expense was $27.1 billion, up 7%, driven by 
higher structural expense and investments in the business, 
including higher compensation, partially offset by lower 
revenue-related compensation as well as lower legal 
expense.
The provision for credit losses was $1.2 billion, 
predominantly driven by a net addition to the allowance for 
credit losses, reflecting deterioration in the Firm’s 
macroeconomic outlook and loan growth.
The provision for credit losses in the prior year was a net 
benefit of $1.2 billion, driven by a net reduction in the 
allowance for credit losses.

Markets revenue
The following table summarizes selected income statement 
data for the Markets businesses. Markets includes both 
Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue 
consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and 
other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm 
assesses its Markets business performance on a total 
revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line 
items. For example, securities that generate net interest 
income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are 
reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. 
Refer to Notes 6 and 7 for a description of the composition 
of these income statement line items. 
Principal transactions reflects revenue on financial 
instruments and commodities transactions that arise from 
client-driven market-making activity. Principal transactions 
revenue includes amounts recognized upon executing new 
transactions with market participants, as well as “inventoryrelated revenue”, which is revenue recognized from gains 
and losses on derivatives and other instruments that the 
Firm has been holding in anticipation of, or in response to, 
client demand, and changes in the fair value of instruments 
used by the Firm to actively manage the risk exposure 
arising from such inventory. Principal transactions revenue 
recognized upon executing new transactions with market 
participants is affected by many factors including the level 
of client activity, the bid-offer spread (which is the 
difference between the price at which a market participant 
is willing and able to sell an instrument to the Firm and the 
price at which another market participant is willing and able 
to buy it from the Firm, and vice versa), market liquidity 
and volatility. These factors are interrelated and sensitive 
to the same factors that drive inventory-related revenue, 
which include general market conditions, such as interest 
rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and equity 
and commodity prices, as well as other macroeconomic 
conditions.

revenue. The loss days determined under this measure differ from the measure used to determine backtesting gains and losses. Daily backtesting gains 
and losses include positions in the Firm’s Risk Management value-at-risk ("VaR") measure and exclude certain components of total net revenue, which 
may more than offset backtesting gains or losses on a particular day. For more information on daily backtesting gains and losses, refer to the VaR

the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
2022 compared with 2021 
Net income was $4.2 billion, down 20%, reflecting a net 
increase in the provision for credit losses compared with a 
net benefit in the prior year.
Net revenue was $11.5 billion, up 15%. Net interest 
income was $8.2 billion, up 35%, driven by deposit margin 
expansion on higher rates and growth in loans, 
predominantly offset by the impact of higher funding costs 
and lower deposits. 
Noninterest revenue was $3.3 billion, down 15%, driven by 
lower investment banking revenue and net markdowns on 
held-for-sale positions, primarily unfunded commitments, in 
the bridge financing portfolio. The decreases were partially 
offset by a gain on an equity method investment received in 
partial satisfaction of a loan.
Noninterest expense was $4.7 billion, up 17%, largely 
driven by higher volume-and revenue-related expense, as 
well as structural expense, including higher compensation 
expense, and expense associated with growth in payments.
The provision for credit losses was $1.3 billion, 
predominantly driven by a net addition to the allowance for 
credit losses, reflecting deterioration in the Firm’s 
macroeconomic outlook and loan growth. 
The provision for credit losses in the prior year was a net 
benefit of $947 million, driven by a net reduction in the 
allowance for credit losses.

2022 compared with 2021 
Net income was $4.4 billion, down 8%.
Net revenue was $17.7 billion, up 5%. Net interest income 
was $5.2 billion, up 35%. Noninterest revenue was $12.5 
billion, down 4%.
Revenue from Asset Management was $8.8 billion, down 
5%, predominantly driven by: 
• net investment valuation losses compared to net gains in 
the prior year and,
• lower asset management fees reflecting a decline in 
market levels and the impact of net liquidity outflows, 
predominantly offset by the removal of most money 
market fund fee waivers.
Revenue from Global Private Bank was $8.9 billion, up 
16%, driven by: 
• margin expansion on higher rates and higher average 
deposits; and to a lesser extent higher average loans and 
wider spreads,
partially offset by
• lower brokerage and placement fees on reduced volume, 
and lower management fees.
Noninterest expense was $11.8 billion, up 8%, driven by 
higher structural expense and investments in the business, 
largely compensation.
The provision for credit losses was $128 million, driven by a 
net addition to the allowance for credit losses. 
The provision for credit losses in the prior year was a net 
benefit of $227 million driven by a net reduction in the 
allowance for credit losses.
Management’s discussion and analysis

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Asset Management has two high-level measures of its 
overall fund performance.
• Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds 
rated 4- or 5-star: Mutual fund rating services rank funds based on 
their risk adjusted performance over various periods. A 5-star rating 
is the best rating and represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked 
funds. A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide 
ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of industrywide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of 
industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and 
represents the bottom 10% of industrywide ranked funds. An overall 
Morningstar rating is derived from a weighted average of the 
performance associated with a fund’s three-, five and ten- year (if 
applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds, 
separate star ratings are provided at the individual share
class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on three-year riskadjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of 
history are not rated and hence excluded from these rankings. All 
ratings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to 
derive these rankings are sourced from the applicable fund rating 
provider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate 
asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on star 
ratings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a 
“primary share class” level to represent the star rating of all other 
funds, except for Japan, for which Nomura provides ratings at the 
fund level. The performance data may have been different if all share 
classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of 
future results.
• Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds 
ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three and five years):All 
quartile rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values 
used to derive these rankings are sourced from the fund rating 
providers. Quartile rankings are based on the net-of-fee absolute 
return of each fund. Where applicable, the fund rating providers 
redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is 
based on fund performance and associated peer rankings at the share 
class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, at a “primary share class” level to 
represent the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong 
SAR funds and at the fund level for all other funds. The performance 
data may have been different if all share classes had been included. 
Past performance is not indicative of future results.
“Primary share class” means the C share class for European funds and 
Acc share class for Hong Kong SAR and Taiwan funds. If these share 
classes are not available, the oldest share class is used as the primary 
share class.

2022 compared with 2021
Net loss was $743 million, compared with a net loss of $3.7 
billion in the prior year.
Net revenue was $80 million, compared with a loss of $3.5 
billion driven by higher net interest income due to higher 
rates, partially offset by lower noninterest revenue. 
Noninterest revenue was a loss of $1.8 billion, compared 
with a gain of $68 million driven by: 
• higher net investment securities losses on sales of U.S. 
GSE and government agency MBS, and U.S. Treasuries 
associated with repositioning the investment securities 
portfolio,
• the impact of movements in foreign exchange on certain 
revenues, primarily as result of the U.S. dollar 
strengthening,
• net losses related to cash deployment transactions, which 
were more than offset by the related net interest income 
earned on those transactions, 
• net losses, including hedging costs on an equity method 
investment related to the Firm's international consumer 
growth initiatives, and
• net losses on certain legacy private equity investments 
compared with net gains in prior year. 
partially offset by
• a gain on the sale of Visa B shares. In connection with the 
sale, the Firm entered into a derivative instrument with 
the purchaser of the shares under which the Firm retains 
the risk associated with changes in the rate at which the 
shares are convertible into Visa Class A common shares 
(“Visa A shares”). Refer to Note 2 for additional

• higher net gains related to certain Other Corporate 
investments, and
• proceeds from an insurance settlement in the first 
quarter of 2022. 
Noninterest expense was $1.0 billion, down $768 million, 
predominantly driven by: 
• lower structural expense reflecting the impact of 
movements in foreign exchange on certain expenses 
primarily as a result of the U.S. dollar strengthening, and 
lower retained technology expense, and
• a lower contribution to the Firm’s Foundation. 
partially offset by
• higher investments, including the costs associated with 
the Firm's international consumer growth initiatives.
The net impact of movements in foreign exchange rates 
associated with the foreign exchange risk that is transferred 
to Treasury and CIO on certain revenues and expenses was 
not material to net income. Refer to Foreign Exchange Risk 
on page 62 for additional information.

The current period income tax benefit was driven by 
benefits related to tax audit settlements as well as other tax 
adjustments, partially offset by a change in the level and 
mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal and 
state and local taxes that also impacted the Firm's tax 
reserves.
Other Corporate also reflects the Firm's international 
consumer growth initiatives, which include Chase U.K., the 
Firm's digital retail bank in the U.K.; Nutmeg, a digital 
wealth manager in the U.K.; and a 40% ownership stake in 
C6 Bank, a digital bank in Brazil, which closed in the first 
quarter of 2022.
Treasury and CIO overview 
Treasury and CIO is predominantly responsible for 
measuring, monitoring, reporting and managing the Firm’s 
liquidity, funding, capital, structural interest rate and 
foreign exchange risks. The risks managed by Treasury and 
CIO arise from the activities undertaken by the Firm’s four 
major reportable business segments to serve their 
respective client bases, which generate both on- and offbalance sheet assets and liabilities.
Treasury and CIO seeks to achieve the Firm’s asset-liability 
management objectives generally by investing in highquality securities that are managed for the longer-term as 
part of the Firm’s investment securities portfolio. Treasury 
and CIO also uses derivatives to meet the Firm’s assetliability management objectives. Refer to Note 5 for further 
information on derivatives. In addition, Treasury and CIO 
manages the Firm’s cash position primarily through 
deposits at central banks and investments in short-term 
instruments. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 
97-104 for further information on liquidity and funding 
risk. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 131-138 
for information on interest rate and foreign exchange risks.
The investment securities portfolio predominantly consists 
of U.S. and non-U.S. government securities, U.S. GSE and 
government agency and nonagency mortgage-backed 
securities, collateralized loan obligations, obligations of U.S. 
states and municipalities and other ABS. At December 31, 
2022, the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, 
net of the allowance for credit losses, was $629.3 billion, 
and the average credit rating of the securities comprising 
the portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where 
available and, where not available, based primarily upon 
internal risk ratings). Refer to Note 10 for further 
information on the Firm’s investment securities portfolio 
and internal risk ratings.

Management’s discussion and analysis

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business 
activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale 
loan, advises customers and clients on their investment 
decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other 
products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. 
The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its business, and 
the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the 
interests of its clients, customers and investors, and 
protecting the safety and soundness of the Firm. 
The Firm believes that effective risk management requires, 
among other things: 
Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and 
escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm; 
Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and 
management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; 
and 
A Firmwide risk governance and oversight structure.
The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation 
framework with strong internal governance and 
independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the 
“Board”). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully 
considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and 
incentive compensation processes. 
Risk governance framework
The Firm’s risk governance framework involves 
understanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and impacts of 
risks. 
Drivers of risks are factors that cause a risk to exist. Drivers 
of risks include, but are not limited to, the economic 
environment, regulatory or government policy, competitor 
or market evolution, business decisions, process or 
judgment error, deliberate wrongdoing, dysfunctional 
markets, and natural disasters.
Types of risks are categories by which risks manifest 
themselves. The Firm’s risks are generally categorized in 
the following four risk types: 
Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or 
reputation associated with poorly designed or failed 
business plans or inadequate responses to changes in 
the operating environment. 
Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the 
default or change in credit profile of a client, 
counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a 
reduction in expected returns on investments, including 
consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and 
investment portfolio risk. 
Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of 
changes in market factors, such as interest and foreign 
exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit 
spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and 
liabilities held for both the short and long term. 
Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome 
resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or 
systems; human factors; or external events impacting 
the Firm’s processes or systems. Operational risk 
includes compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and 
model risk.
Impacts of risks are consequences of risks, both quantitative 
and qualitative. There may be many consequences of risks 
manifesting, including quantitative impacts such as a 
reduction in earnings and capital, liquidity outflows, and 
fines or penalties, or qualitative impacts such as damage to 
the Firm’s reputation, loss of clients and customers, and 
regulatory and enforcement actions.
The Firm’s risk governance framework is managed on a 
Firmwide basis. The Firm has an Independent Risk 
Management (“IRM”) function, which is comprised of Risk 
Management and Compliance. The Firm’s Chief Executive 
Officer (“CEO”) appoints, subject to approval by the Risk 
Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Board Risk 
Committee”), the Firm’s Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”) to lead 
the IRM function and maintain the risk governance 
framework of the Firm. The framework is subject to 
approval by the Board Risk Committee through its review 
and approval of the Risk Governance and Oversight Policy. 
The Firm’s CRO oversees and delegates authority to the 
Firmwide Risk Executives (“FREs”), the Chief Risk Officers of 
the LOBs and Corporate (“LOB CROs”), and the Firm’s Chief 
Compliance Officer (“CCO”), who, in turn, establish Risk 
Management and Compliance organizations, develop the 
Firm’s risk governance policies and standards, and define 
and oversee the implementation of the Firm’s risk 
governance framework. The LOB CROs oversee risks that 
arise in their LOBs and Corporate, while FREs oversee risks 
that span across the LOBs and Corporate, functions and 
regions. Each area of the Firm giving rise to risk is expected 
to operate within the parameters identified by the IRM 
function, and within its own management-identified risk and 
control standards. 
Three lines of defense
The Firm’s “three lines of defense” are as follows: 
The first line of defense consists of each LOB, Treasury and 
CIO, and certain Other Corporate initiatives, including their 
aligned Operations, Technology and Control Management. 
The first line of defense own the identification of risks 
within their respective organizations and the design and 
execution of controls to manage those risks. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Responsibilities also include adherence to applicable laws, 
rules and regulations and implementation of the risk 
governance framework established by IRM, which may 
include policies, standards, limits, thresholds and controls. 
The second line of defense is the IRM function, which is 
separate from, and independently assesses and challenges, 
the first line of defense risk management practices. IRM is 
also responsible for the identification of risks within its 
respective organization, adherence to applicable laws, rules 
and regulations and for the development and 
implementation of policies and standards with respect to its 
own processes. 
The third line of defense is Internal Audit, an independent 
function that provides objective assessment of the 
adequacy and effectiveness of Firmwide processes, 
controls, governance and risk management. The Internal 
Audit function is headed by the General Auditor, who 
reports to the Audit Committee and administratively to the 
CEO. 
In addition, there are other functions that contribute to the 
Firmwide control environment but are not considered part 
of a particular line of defense, including Finance, Human 
Resources and Legal. These other functions are responsible 
for the identification of risks within their respective 
organizations, adherence to applicable laws, rules and 
regulations and implementation of the risk governance 
framework established by IRM.
Risk identification and ownership
The LOBs and Corporate own the identification of risks 
within their respective organizations, as well as the design 
and execution of controls, including IRM-specified controls, 
to manage those risks. To support this activity, the Firm has 
a risk identification framework designed to facilitate each 
LOB and Corporate’s responsibility to identify material risks 
inherent to the Firm’s business and operational activities, 
catalog them in a central repository and review material 
risks on a regular basis. The IRM function reviews and 
challenges the LOB and Corporate’s identified risks, 
maintains the central repository and provides the 
consolidated Firmwide results to the Firmwide Risk 
Committee (“FRC”) and the Board Risk Committee. 
Risk appetite
The Firm’s overall appetite for risk is governed by “Risk 
Appetite” frameworks for quantitative and qualitative risks. 
Periodically the Firm’s risk appetite is set and approved by 
senior management (including the CEO and CRO) and 
approved by the Board Risk Committee. Quantitative and 
qualitative risks are assessed to monitor and measure the 
Firm’s capacity to take risk consistent with its stated risk 
appetite. Risk appetite results are reported to the Board 
Risk Committee. 
Management’s discussion and analysis

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Risk governance and oversight structure
The independent status of the IRM function is supported by a risk governance and oversight structure that provides channels 
for the escalation of risks and issues to senior management, the FRC, and the Board of Directors, as appropriate. 
The chart below illustrates the committees of the Board of Directors and key senior management-level committees in the 
Firm’s risk governance and oversight structure. In addition, there are other committees, forums and channels of escalation 
that support the oversight of risk that are not shown in the chart below or described in this Form 10-K.
The Firm’s Operating Committee, which consists of the 
Firm’s CEO, CRO, Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), General 
Counsel, CEOs of the LOBs and other senior executives, is 
accountable to and may refer matters to the Firm’s Board of 
Directors. The Operating Committee is responsible for 
escalating to the Board the information necessary to 
facilitate the Board’s exercise of its duties.
Board oversight
The Firm’s Board of Directors actively oversees the business 
and affairs of the Firm. This includes monitoring the Firm’s 
financial performance and condition and reviewing the 
strategic objectives and plans of the Firm. The Board carries 
out a significant portion of its oversight responsibilities 
through its principal standing committees, each of which 
consists solely of independent members of the Board. The 
Board Risk Committee is the principal committee that 
oversees risk matters. The Audit Committee oversees the 
control environment, and the Compensation & Management 
Development Committee oversees compensation and other 
management-related matters. Each committee of the Board 
oversees reputational risks, conduct risks, and ESG matters 
within its scope of responsibility.
The JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Board of Directors is 
responsible for the oversight of management of the bank, 
which it discharges both acting directly and through the 
principal standing committees of the Firm’s Board of 
Directors. Risk and control oversight on behalf of JPMorgan 
Chase Bank N.A. is primarily the responsibility of the Board 
Risk Committee and the Audit Committee, respectively, and, 
with respect to compensation and other managementrelated matters, the Compensation & Management 
Development Committee.
The Board Risk Committee assists the Board in its oversight 
of management’s responsibility to implement a global risk 
management framework reasonably designed to identify, 
assess and manage the Firm’s risks. The Board Risk 
Committee’s responsibilities include approval of applicable 
primary risk policies and review of certain associated 
frameworks, analysis and reporting established by 
management. Breaches in risk appetite and parameters, 
issues that may have a material adverse impact on the Firm, 
including capital and liquidity issues, and other significant 
risk-related matters are escalated to the Board Risk 
Committee, as appropriate.
The Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of 
management’s responsibility to ensure that there is an 
effective system of controls reasonably designed to 
safeguard the Firm’s assets and income, ensure the 
integrity of the Firm’s financial statements, and maintain 
compliance with the Firm’s ethical standards, policies, plans 
and procedures, and with laws and regulations. It also 
assists the Board in its oversight of the qualifications, 
independence and performance of the Firm’s independent 
registered public accounting firm, and of the performance 
of the Firm’s Internal Audit function.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

The Compensation & Management Development Committee 
(“CMDC”) assists the Board in its oversight of the Firm’s 
compensation principles and practices. The CMDC reviews 
and approves the Firm’s compensation and qualified 
benefits programs. The Committee reviews the performance 
of Operating Committee members against their goals, and 
approves their compensation awards. In addition, the CEO’s 
award is subject to ratification by the independent directors 
of the Board. The CMDC also reviews the development of 
and succession for key executives. As part of the Board’s 
role of reinforcing, demonstrating and communicating the 
“tone at the top,” the CMDC oversees the Firm’s culture, 
including reviewing updates from management regarding 
significant conduct issues and any related actions with 
respect to employees, including compensation actions.
The Public Responsibility Committee oversees and reviews 
the Firm's positions and practices on public responsibility 
matters such as community investment, fair lending, 
sustainability, consumer practices and other public policy 
issues that reflect the Firm's values and character and could 
impact the Firm's reputation among its stakeholders. The 
Committee also provides guidance on these matters to 
management and the Board, as appropriate.
The Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee 
exercises general oversight with respect to the governance 
of the Board of Directors. It reviews the qualifications of 
and recommends to the Board proposed nominees for 
election to the Board. The Committee evaluates and 
recommends to the Board corporate governance practices 
applicable to the Firm. It also reviews the framework for 
assessing the Board’s performance and self-evaluation. 
Management oversight
The Firm’s senior management-level committees that are 
primarily responsible for key risk-related functions include:
The Firmwide Risk Committee (“FRC”) is the Firm’s highest 
management-level risk committee. It oversees the risks 
inherent in the Firm’s business and provides a forum for 
discussion of topics, and issues that are raised or escalated 
by its members and other committees.
The Firmwide Control Committee (“FCC”) is an escalation 
committee for senior management to review and discuss 
the Firmwide operational risk environment including 
identified issues, operational risk metrics and significant 
events that have been escalated. 
Line of Business and Regional Risk Committees are 
responsible for overseeing the governance, limits, and 
controls that have been established within the scope of 
their respective activities. These committees review the 
ways in which the particular LOB or the businesses 
operating in a particular region could be exposed to 
adverse outcomes, with a focus on identifying, accepting, 
escalating and/or requiring remediation of matters brought 
to these committees. 
Line of Business and Corporate Function Control Committees 
oversee the operational risk and control environment of 
their respective business or function, inclusive of 
Operational Risk, Compliance and Conduct Risks. As part of 
that mandate, they are responsible for reviewing indicators 
of elevated or emerging risks and other data that may 
impact the level of operational risk in a business or 
function, addressing key operational risk issues, with an 
emphasis on processes with control concerns and 
overseeing control remediation. 
The Asset and Liability Committee (“ALCO”) is responsible for 
overseeing the Firm’s asset and liability management 
(“ALM”), including the activities and frameworks supporting 
management of the balance sheet, liquidity risk, interest 
rate risk, and capital risk. 
The Firmwide Valuation Governance Forum (“VGF”) is 
composed of senior finance and risk executives and is 
responsible for overseeing the management of risks arising 
from valuation activities conducted across the Firm. 
Risk governance and oversight functions
The Firm manages its risk through risk governance and 
oversight functions. The scope of a particular function or 
business activity may include one or more drivers, types 
and/or impacts of risk. For example, Country Risk 
Management oversees country risk which may be a driver of 
risk or an aggregation of exposures that could give rise to 
multiple risk types such as credit or market risk. 
The following sections discuss the risk governance and 
oversight functions that have been established to manage 
the risks inherent in the Firm’s business activities.

STRATEGIC RISK MANAGEMENT
Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or 
reputation associated with poorly designed or failed 
business plans or inadequate responses to changes in the 
operating environment. 
Management and oversight
The Operating Committee, together with the senior 
leadership of each LOB and Corporate, is responsible for 
managing the Firm’s most significant strategic risks. IRM 
engages regularly in strategic business discussions and 
decision-making, including participation in relevant 
business reviews and senior management meetings, risk 
and control committees and other relevant governance 
forums, and acquisition and new business initiative reviews. 
The Board of Directors oversees management’s strategic 
decisions, and the Board Risk Committee oversees IRM and 
the Firm’s risk governance framework.
In the process of developing business plans and strategic 
initiatives, LOB and Corporate senior management identify 
the associated risks that are incorporated into the Firmwide 
Risk Identification framework and their impact on risk 
appetite. 
In addition, IRM conducts a qualitative assessment of the 
LOB and Corporate strategic initiatives to assess their 
impact on the risk profile of the Firm. 
The Firm’s strategic planning process, which includes the 
development of the Firm’s strategic plan and other strategic 
initiatives, is one component of managing the Firm’s 
strategic risk. The strategic plan outlines the Firm’s 
strategic framework and initiatives, and includes 
components such as budget, risk appetite, capital, earnings 
and asset-liability management objectives. Guided by the 
Firm’s How We Do Business Principles, the Operating 
Committee and senior management teams in each LOB and 
Corporate review and update the strategic plan periodically, 
including evaluating the strategic framework and 
performance against prior-year initiatives, assessing the 
operating environment, refining existing strategies and 
developing new strategies.
The Firm’s strategic plan, together with IRM’s assessment, 
are provided to the Board as part of its review and approval 
of the Firm’s strategic plan, and the plan is also reflected in 
the Firm's budget. 
The Firm’s balance sheet strategy, which focuses on riskadjusted returns, strong capital and robust liquidity, is also 
a component in the management of strategic risk. Refer to 
Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for further 
information on capital risk. Refer to Liquidity Risk 
Management on pages 97-104 for further information on 
liquidity risk. Refer to Reputation Risk Management on page 
105 for further information on reputation risk.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

 CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or 
composition of capital to support the Firm’s business 
activities and associated risks during normal economic 
environments and under stressed conditions.
A strong capital position is essential to the Firm’s business 
strategy and competitive position. Maintaining a strong 
balance sheet to manage through economic volatility is 
considered a strategic imperative of the Firm’s Board of 
Directors, CEO and Operating Committee. The Firm’s 
fortress balance sheet philosophy focuses on risk-adjusted 
returns, strong capital and robust liquidity. The Firm’s 
capital risk management strategy focuses on maintaining 
long-term stability to enable the Firm to build and invest in 
market-leading businesses, including in highly stressed 
environments. Senior management considers the 
implications on the Firm’s capital prior to making significant 
decisions that could impact future business activities. In 
addition to considering the Firm’s earnings outlook, senior 
management evaluates all sources and uses of capital with 
a view to ensuring the Firm’s capital strength.
Capital risk management
The Firm has a Capital Risk Management function whose 
primary objective is to provide independent oversight of 
capital risk across the Firm. 
Capital Risk Management’s responsibilities include:
Defining, monitoring and reporting capital risk metrics;
Establishing, calibrating and monitoring capital risk 
limits and indicators, including capital risk appetite;
Developing a process to classify, monitor and report 
capital limit breaches; 
Performing an assessment of the Firm’s capital 
management activities, including changes made to the 
Contingency Capital Plan described below; and
Conducting assessments of the Firm's regulatory capital 
framework intended to ensure compliance with 
applicable regulatory capital rules.
Capital management
Treasury and CIO is responsible for capital management. 
The primary objectives of the Firm’s capital management 
are to:
Maintain sufficient capital in order to continue to build 
and invest in the Firm’s businesses through the cycle 
and in stressed environments;
Retain flexibility to take advantage of future investment 
opportunities;
Promote the Firm’s ability to serve as a source of 
strength to its subsidiaries;
Ensure the Firm operates above the minimum regulatory 
capital ratios as well as maintain “well-capitalized” 
status for the Firm and its insured depository institution 
(“IDI”) subsidiaries at all times under applicable 
regulatory capital requirements;
Meet capital distribution objectives; and
Maintain sufficient capital resources to operate 
throughout a resolution period in accordance with the 
Firm’s preferred resolution strategy.
The Firm addresses these objectives through: 
Establishing internal minimum capital requirements and 
maintaining a strong capital governance framework. The 
internal minimum capital levels consider the Firm’s 
regulatory capital requirements as well as an internal 
assessment of capital adequacy, in normal economic 
cycles and in stress events;
Retaining flexibility in order to react to a range of 
potential events; and
Regular monitoring of the Firm’s capital position and 
following prescribed escalation protocols, both at the 
Firm and material legal entity levels.
Governance
Committees responsible for overseeing the Firm’s capital 
management include the Capital Governance Committee, 
the Firmwide ALCO and LOB and regional ALCOs, and the 
CIO, Treasury and Corporate (“CTC”) Risk Committee. In 
addition, the Board Risk Committee periodically reviews the 
Firm’s capital risk tolerance. Refer to Firmwide Risk 
Management on pages 81-84 for additional discussion of 
the Firmwide ALCO and other risk-related committees.
Capital planning and stress testing
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review 
The Federal Reserve requires large Bank Holding 
Companies (“BHCs”), including the Firm, to submit at least 
annually a capital plan that has been reviewed and 
approved by the Board of Directors. The Federal Reserve 
uses Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) 
and other stress testing processes to ensure that large BHCs 
have sufficient capital during periods of economic and 
financial stress, and have robust, forward-looking capital 
assessment and planning processes in place that address 
each BHC’s unique risks to enable it to absorb losses under 
certain stress scenarios. Through CCAR, the Federal Reserve 
evaluates each BHC’s capital adequacy and internal capital 
adequacy assessment processes (“ICAAP”), as well as its 
plans to make capital distributions, such as dividend 
payments or stock repurchases. The Federal Reserve uses 
results under the severely adverse scenario from its 
supervisory stress test to determine each firm’s Stress 
Capital Buffer (“SCB”) requirement for the coming year. 
On June 27, 2022, the Firm announced that it had 
completed the Federal Reserve's 2022 CCAR stress test 
process. On August 4, 2022, the Federal Reserve affirmed 
the Firm's 2022 SCB requirement of 4.0% (up from 3.2%), 
and the Firm’s Standardized CET1 capital ratio requirement, 
including regulatory buffers, of 12.0% (up from 11.2%). 
The 2022 SCB requirement became effective on October 1, 
2022, and will remain in effect until September 30, 2023. 
Management’s discussion and analysis

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Refer to Capital actions on page 94 for information on 
actions taken by the Firm’s Board of Directors.
Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process 
Annually, the Firm prepares the ICAAP, which informs the 
Board of Directors of the ongoing assessment of the Firm’s 
processes for managing the sources and uses of capital as 
well as compliance with supervisory expectations for capital 
planning and capital adequacy. The Firm’s ICAAP integrates 
stress testing protocols with capital planning. The Firm’s 
Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving 
the capital planning framework.
Stress testing assesses the potential impact of alternative 
economic and business scenarios on the Firm’s earnings 
and capital. Economic scenarios, and the parameters 
underlying those scenarios, are defined centrally and 
applied uniformly across the businesses. These scenarios 
are articulated in terms of macroeconomic factors, which 
are key drivers of business results; global market shocks, 
which generate short-term but severe trading losses; and 
idiosyncratic operational risk events. The scenarios are 
intended to capture and stress key vulnerabilities and 
idiosyncratic risks facing the Firm. In addition to CCAR and 
other periodic stress testing, management also considers 
tailored stress scenarios and sensitivity analyses, as 
necessary. 
Contingency Capital Plan
The Firm’s Contingency Capital Plan establishes the capital 
management framework for the Firm and specifies the 
principles underlying the Firm’s approach towards capital 
management in normal economic conditions and in stressed 
environments. The Contingency Capital Plan defines how 
the Firm calibrates its targeted capital levels and meets 
minimum capital requirements, monitors the ongoing 
appropriateness of planned capital distributions, and sets 
out the capital contingency actions that are expected to be 
taken or considered at various levels of capital depletion 
during a period of stress.
Regulatory capital
The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, 
including well-capitalized standards, for the consolidated 
financial holding company. The OCC establishes similar 
minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm’s 
IDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The 
U.S. capital requirements generally follow the Capital 
Accord of the Basel Committee, as amended from time to 
time.
Basel III Overview
The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital 
ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and 
internationally active U.S. BHCs and banks, including the 
Firm and its IDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of regulatory capital that 
must be held by BHCs and banks is determined by 
calculating RWA, which are on-balance sheet assets and offbalance sheet exposures, weighted according to risk. Two 
comprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating 
RWA: a standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), 
and an advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each 
of the risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the 
Firm is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or 
Advanced approaches compared to their respective 
regulatory capital ratio requirements. The Firm’s Basel III 
Standardized risk-based ratios are currently more binding 
than the Basel III Advanced risk-based ratios.
Basel III establishes capital requirements for calculating 
credit risk RWA and market risk RWA, and in the case of 
Basel III Advanced, operational risk RWA. Key differences in 
the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized 
and Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced, 
credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which 
largely rely on the use of internal credit models and 
parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk 
RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-weightings 
which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. 
Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally consistent 
basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced. 
In addition to the RWA calculated under these approaches, 
the Firm may supplement such amounts to incorporate 
management judgment and feedback from its regulators. 
Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced 
Approaches banking organizations, including the Firm, to 
calculate the SLR. Refer to SLR on page 93 for additional 
information.
Key Regulatory Developments 
CECL regulatory capital transition. 
Until December 31, 2021, the Firm’s capital reflected a two 
year delay of the effects of CECL provided by the Federal 
Reserve Board in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Beginning January 1, 2022, the $2.9 billion CECL capital 
benefit is being phased out at 25% per year over a threeyear period. As of December 31, 2022, the Firm’s CET1 
capital reflected the remaining $2.2 billion benefit 
associated with the CECL capital transition provisions. 
Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, the Firm phased 
out 25% of the other CECL capital transition provisions 
which impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets, 
total leverage exposure and RWA, as applicable. 
Refer to Note 1 for further information on the CECL 
accounting guidance.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk. On 
January 1, 2022, the Firm adopted “Standardized Approach 
for Counterparty Credit Risk” (“SA-CCR”), which replaced 
the Current Exposure Method used to measure derivatives 
counterparty exposure under the Standardized and 
Advanced approach RWA where internal models are not 
used, as well as leverage exposure used to calculate the SLR 
in the regulatory capital framework. The rule issued by the 
U.S. banking regulators in November 2019 applies to Basel 
III Advanced Approaches banking organizations, such as the 
Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
The adoption of SA-CCR on January 1, 2022 increased the 
Firm’s Standardized RWA by approximately $40 billion 
based on the Firm's derivatives exposure as of December 
31, 2021, which resulted in a decrease of approximately 30 
bps to the Firm's CET1 capital ratio and a modest decrease 
in its total leverage exposure. In addition, the adoption of 
SA-CCR increased the Firm's Advanced RWA, but to a lesser 
extent than Standardized RWA.
Management’s discussion and analysis

Risk-based Capital Regulatory Requirements 
The following chart presents the Firm’s Basel III CET1 capital ratio requirements under the Basel III rules currently in effect.
All banking institutions are currently required to have a 
minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted 
assets.
Certain banking organizations, including the Firm, are 
required to hold additional levels of capital to serve as a 
“capital conservation buffer”. The capital conservation 
buffer incorporates a GSIB surcharge, a discretionary 
countercyclical capital buffer and a fixed capital 
conservation buffer of 2.5% for Advanced regulatory 
capital requirements and a variable SCB requirement, 
floored at 2.5%, for Standardized regulatory capital 
requirements. 
Under the Federal Reserve’s GSIB rule, the Firm is required 
to assess its GSIB surcharge on an annual basis under two 
separately prescribed methods based on data for the 
previous fiscal year-end, and is subject to the higher of the 
two. “Method 1” reflects the GSIB surcharge as prescribed 
by the Basel Committee’s assessment methodology, and is 
calculated by the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”) across 
five criteria: size, cross-jurisdictional activity, 
interconnectedness, complexity and substitutability. 
“Method 2”, calculated by the Firm, modifies the Method 1 
requirements to include a measure of short-term wholesale 
funding in place of substitutability, and introduces a GSIB 
score “multiplication factor”. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

The following table presents the Firm’s effective GSIB 
surcharge for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 
and 2021. For 2023, the Firm’s effective GSIB surcharge 
under Method 1 and Method 2 has increased to 2.5% and 
4.0%, respectively.

Method 1
 2.5 %
 2.0 %
 2.0 %
Method 2
 4.0 %
 3.5 %
 3.5 %
On November 21, 2022, the FSB released its annual GSIB 
list based upon data as of December 31, 2021, which 
affirmed the Firm’s Method 1 GSIB surcharge of 2.5% (up 
from 2.0%), effective January 1, 2023.
The Firm’s Method 2 surcharge calculated using data as of 
December 31, 2021 is 4.5%, which will be effective 
January 1, 2024. The Firm’s estimated Method 2 surcharge 
calculated using data as of December 31, 2022 is 4.5%. 
Accordingly, based on the GSIB rule currently in effect, the 
Firm’s effective GSIB surcharge is expected to increase to 
4.5% on January 1, 2024.
The U.S. federal regulatory capital standards include a 
framework for setting a discretionary countercyclical capital 
buffer taking into account the macro financial environment 
in which large, internationally active banks function. As of 
December 31, 2022, the U.S. countercyclical capital buffer 
remained at 0%. The Federal Reserve will continue to 
review the buffer at least annually. The buffer can be 
increased if the Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC determine 
that systemic risks are meaningfully above normal and can 
be calibrated up to an additional 2.5% of RWA subject to a 
12-month implementation period. 
Failure to maintain regulatory capital equal to or in excess 
of the risk-based regulatory capital minimum plus the 
capital conservation buffer (inclusive of the GSIB surcharge) 
and any countercyclical buffer will result in limitations to 
the amount of capital that the Firm may distribute, such as 
through dividends and common share repurchases, as well 
as certain executive discretionary bonus payments.
Risk-based Capital Targets
The Firm’s current target for its Basel III Standardized CET1 
capital ratio is 13.0% for the first quarter of 2023, 
increasing to 13.5% for the first quarter of 2024 with 
consideration for an increase in the GSIB surcharge in 
2024, and assuming no change in the Stress Capital Buffer. 
The Firm’s quarterly capital ratios may vary from these 
targets dependent on market conditions. These targets are 
based on the Basel III capital rules currently in effect.
Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity
The Federal Reserve’s TLAC rule requires the U.S. GSIB toptier holding companies, including the Firm, to maintain 
minimum levels of external TLAC and eligible long-term 
debt (“eligible LTD”). Refer to TLAC on page 95 for 
additional information.
Leverage-based Capital Regulatory Requirements
Supplementary leverage ratio
Banking organizations subject to the Basel III Advanced 
approach are currently required to have a minimum SLR of 
3.0%. Certain banking organizations, including the Firm, 
are also required to hold an additional 2.0% leverage 
buffer.
The SLR is defined as Tier 1 capital under Basel III divided 
by the Firm’s total leverage exposure. Total leverage 
exposure is calculated by taking the Firm’s total average 
on-balance sheet assets, less amounts permitted to be 
deducted for Tier 1 capital, and adding certain off-balance 
sheet exposures, such as undrawn commitments and 
derivatives potential future exposure. 
Failure to maintain an SLR equal to or greater than the 
regulatory requirement will result in limitations on the 
amount of capital that the Firm may distribute such as 
through dividends and common share repurchases, as well 
as on certain executive discretionary bonus payments.
Other regulatory capital
In addition to meeting the capital ratio requirements of 
Basel III, the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries must also 
maintain minimum capital and leverage ratios in order to be 
“well-capitalized” under the regulations issued by the 
Federal Reserve and the Prompt Corrective Action (“PCA”) 
requirements of the FDIC Improvement Act (“FDICIA”), 
respectively. Refer to Note 27 for additional information. 
Additional information regarding the Firm’s capital ratios, 
as well as the U.S. federal regulatory capital standards to 
which the Firm is subject, is presented in Note 27. Refer to 
the Firm’s Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, 
which are available on the Firm’s website, for further 
information on the Firm’s Basel III measures.

Line of business equity 
Each business segment is allocated capital by taking into 
consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of 
similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital 
requirements. ROE is measured and internal targets for 
expected returns are established as key measures of a 
business segment’s performance. 
The Firm’s allocation methodology incorporates Basel III 
Standardized RWA, Basel III Advanced RWA, the GSIB 
surcharge, and a simulation of capital in a severe stress 
environment. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments 
and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed 
and, as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may 
change. As of January 1, 2023, the Firm has changed its 
line of business capital allocations primarily as a result of 
updates to the Firm’s capital requirements and changes in 
RWA for each LOB.

Effective May 1, 2022, the Firm is authorized to purchase 
up to $30 billion of common shares under its common 
share repurchase program, which superseded the 
previously approved repurchase program under which the 
Firm was authorized to purchase up to $30 billion of 
common shares. 
On July 14, 2022, the Firm announced that it had 
temporarily suspended share repurchases in anticipation of 
the increase in the Firm's regulatory capital requirements. 
The Firm had set a target for achieving CET1 capital of 
13.0% by the first quarter of 2023. The Firm met and 
exceeded that target in the fourth quarter of 2022, and 
resumed repurchasing shares under its common share 
repurchase program in the first quarter of 2023.

(a) As directed by the Federal Reserve, total net repurchases and common 
stock dividends in the first and second quarter of 2021 were restricted 
and could not exceed the average of the Firm’s net income for the four 
preceding calendar quarters. Effective July 1, 2021, the Firm became 
subject to the normal capital distribution restrictions provided under 
the regulatory capital framework.
(b) On March 15, 2020, in response to the economic disruptions caused 
by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm temporarily suspended 
repurchases of its common stock. Subsequently, the Federal Reserve 
directed all large banks, including the Firm, to discontinue net share 
repurchases through the end of 2020. 
The Board of Directors’ authorization to repurchase 
common shares is utilized at management’s discretion, and 
the timing of purchases and the exact amount of common 
shares that may be repurchased is subject to various 
factors, including market conditions; legal and regulatory 
considerations affecting the amount and timing of 
repurchase activity; the Firm’s capital position (taking into 
account goodwill and intangibles); internal capital 
generation; and alternative investment opportunities. The 
$30 billion common share repurchase program approved 
by the Board does not establish specific price targets or 
timetables. The repurchase program may be suspended by 
management at any time; and may be executed through 
open market purchases or privately negotiated 
transactions, or utilizing Rule 10b5-1 plans, which are 
written trading plans that the Firm may enter into from 
time to time under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934 and which allow the Firm to repurchase its 
common shares during periods when it may otherwise not 
be repurchasing common shares — for example, during 
internal trading blackout periods.
Refer to Part II, Item 5: Market for Registrant’s Common 
Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of 
Equity Securities on page 34 of the 2022 Form 10-K for 
additional information regarding repurchases of the Firm’s 
equity securities.

Other capital requirements 
Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity
The Federal Reserve’s TLAC rule requires the U.S. GSIB toptier holding companies, including the Firm, to maintain 
minimum levels of external TLAC and eligible long-term 
debt.
The external TLAC requirements and the minimum level of 
eligible long-term debt requirements are shown below:
(a) RWA is the greater of Standardized and Advanced compared to their 
respective regulatory capital ratio requirements.
Failure to maintain TLAC equal to or in excess of the 
regulatory minimum plus applicable buffers will result in 
limitations on the amount of capital that the Firm may 
distribute, such as through dividends and common share 
repurchases, as well as on certain executive discretionary 
bonus payments.
The following table presents the eligible external TLAC and 
eligible LTD amounts, as well as a representation of these 
amounts as a percentage of the Firm’s total RWA and total 
leverage exposure applying the impact of the CECL capital 
transition provisions as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Management’s discussion and analysis

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet 
its contractual and contingent financial obligations as they 
arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount, 
composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to support 
its assets and liabilities. 
Liquidity risk management
The Firm has a Liquidity Risk Management (“LRM”) function 
whose primary objective is to provide independent 
oversight of liquidity risk across the Firm. Liquidity Risk 
Management’s responsibilities include: 
Defining, monitoring and reporting liquidity risk metrics; 
Independently establishing and monitoring limits and 
indicators, including liquidity risk appetite; 
Developing a process to classify, monitor and report 
limit breaches; 
Performing an independent review of liquidity risk 
management processes to evaluate their adequacy and 
effectiveness based on LRM’s Independent Review 
Framework; 
Monitoring and reporting internal Firmwide and legal 
entity liquidity stress tests, regulatory defined metrics, 
as well as liquidity positions, balance sheet variances 
and funding activities; and 
Approving or escalating for review new or updated 
liquidity stress assumptions.
Liquidity management 
Treasury and CIO is responsible for liquidity management.
The primary objectives of the Firm’s liquidity management 
are to: 
Ensure that the Firm’s core businesses and material 
legal entities are able to operate in support of client 
needs and meet contractual and contingent financial 
obligations through normal economic cycles as well as 
during stress events, and 
Manage an optimal funding mix and availability of 
liquidity sources. 
The Firm addresses these objectives through: 
Analyzing and understanding the liquidity characteristics 
of the assets and liabilities of the Firm, LOBs and legal 
entities, taking into account legal, regulatory, and 
operational restrictions; 
Developing internal liquidity stress testing assumptions; 
Defining and monitoring Firmwide and legal entityspecific liquidity strategies, policies, reporting and 
contingency funding plans; 
Managing liquidity within the Firm’s approved liquidity 
risk appetite tolerances and limits; 
Managing compliance with regulatory requirements 
related to funding and liquidity risk; and 
Setting FTP in accordance with underlying liquidity 
characteristics of balance sheet assets and liabilities as 
well as certain off-balance sheet items. 
As part of the Firm’s overall liquidity management strategy, 
the Firm manages liquidity and funding using a centralized, 
global approach designed to: 
Optimize liquidity sources and uses; 
Monitor exposures; 
Identify constraints on the transfer of liquidity between 
the Firm’s legal entities; and 
Maintain the appropriate amount of surplus liquidity at 
a Firmwide and legal entity level, where relevant. 
Governance
Committees responsible for liquidity governance include the 
Firmwide ALCO as well as LOB and regional ALCOs, the 
Treasurer Committee, and the CTC Risk Committee. In 
addition, the Board Risk Committee reviews and 
recommends to the Board of Directors, for formal approval, 
the Firm’s liquidity risk tolerances, liquidity strategy, and 
liquidity policy. Refer to Firmwide Risk Management on 
pages 81-84 for further discussion of ALCO and other riskrelated committees. 
Internal stress testing
Liquidity stress tests are intended to ensure that the Firm 
has sufficient liquidity under a variety of adverse scenarios, 
including scenarios analyzed as part of the Firm’s resolution 
and recovery planning. Stress scenarios are produced for 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“Parent Company”) and the Firm’s 
material legal entities on a regular basis, and other stress 
tests are performed in response to specific market events 
or concerns. Liquidity stress tests assume all of the Firm’s 
contractual financial obligations are met and take into 
consideration: 
Varying levels of access to unsecured and secured 
funding markets; 
Estimated non-contractual and contingent cash 
outflows;
Considerations of credit rating downgrades; 
Collateral haircuts; and 
Potential impediments to the availability and 
transferability of liquidity between jurisdictions and 
material legal entities such as regulatory, legal or other 
restrictions. 
Liquidity outflows are modeled across a range of time 
horizons and currency dimensions and contemplate both 
market and idiosyncratic stresses. 
Results of stress tests are considered in the formulation of 
the Firm’s funding plan and assessment of its liquidity 
position. The Parent Company acts as a source of funding 
for the Firm through equity and long-term debt issuances, 
and its intermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase 
Holdings LLC (the “IHC”), provides funding support to the 
ongoing operations of the Parent Company and its 
subsidiaries. The Firm maintains liquidity at the Parent 
Company, the IHC, and operating subsidiaries at levels 
sufficient to comply with liquidity risk tolerances and 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

minimum liquidity requirements, and to manage through 
periods of stress when access to normal funding sources 
may be disrupted.
Contingency funding plan
The Firm’s Contingency Funding Plan (“CFP”) sets out the 
strategies for addressing and managing liquidity resource 
needs during a liquidity stress event and incorporates 
liquidity risk limits, indicators and risk appetite tolerances. 
The CFP also identifies the alternative contingent funding 
and liquidity resources available to the Firm and its legal 
entities in a period of stress. 
LCR and HQLA
The LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is 
sufficient to meet their respective estimated total net cash 
outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of 
significant stress. Eligible HQLA, for purposes of calculating 
the LCR, is the amount of unencumbered HQLA that satisfy 
certain operational considerations as defined in the LCR 
rule. HQLA primarily consist of cash and certain high-quality 
liquid securities as defined in the LCR rule. 
Under the LCR rule, the amount of eligible HQLA held by 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its standalone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that is not 
transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded from 
the Firm’s reported eligible HQLA. 
Estimated net cash outflows are based on standardized 
stress outflow and inflow rates prescribed in the LCR rule, 
which are applied to the balances of the Firm’s assets, 
sources of funds, and obligations. The LCR for both the Firm 
and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a 
minimum of 100%. 
The following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended 
December 31, 2022, September 30, 2022 and 
December 31, 2021 based on the Firm’s interpretation of

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR decreased during 
the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared 
with the three months ended September 30, 2022 
reflecting a decrease in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s HQLA, 
primarily due to a reduction in cash associated with a 
decline in deposits, and loan growth.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three 
months ended December 31, 2022 decreased when 
compared with the same period in the prior year, reflecting 
a decrease in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s HQLA as a result 
of a reduction in cash from loan growth and a decline in 
deposits as well as lower market values of HQLA-eligible 
investment securities. Refer to Note 10 for additional 
information on the Firm's investment securities portfolio.
The Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR 
fluctuates from period to period due to changes in its 
eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of 
ongoing business activity. Refer to the Firm’s U.S. LCR 
Disclosure reports, which are available on the Firm’s 
website, for a further discussion of the Firm’s LCR.
Other liquidity sources
In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s eligible 
HQLA discussed above, the Firm had unencumbered 
marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities, 
that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity. 
This includes excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank 
affiliates. The fair value of these securities was 
approximately $694 billion and $914 billion as of 
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, although the 
amount of liquidity that could be raised at any particular 
time would be dependent on prevailing market conditions. 
The fair value decreased compared to December 31, 2021, 
primarily due to a decrease in excess eligible HQLA 
securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as noted above.
The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the 
FHLBs and the discount window at the Federal Reserve 
Banks as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such 
banks of approximately $323 billion and $308 billion as of 
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. This borrowing 
capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities 
reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered 
securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve 
Banks discount window and other central banks. Available 
borrowing capacity increased from December 31, 2021 
primarily due to increased credit card receivables pledged 
at the Federal Reserve Banks. Although available, the Firm 
does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal 
Reserve Banks discount window and the other central banks 
as a primary source of liquidity.

NSFR
The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity 
requirement for large banking organizations that is 
intended to measure the adequacy of “available” stable 
funding that is sufficient to meet their “required” amounts 
of stable funding over a one-year horizon. 
As of December 31, 2022, the Firm and JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. were compliant with the 100% minimum NSFR 
requirement, based on the Firm’s current interpretation of 
the final rule. The Firm will be required to publicly disclose 
its quarterly average NSFR semiannually beginning in the 
second half of 2023.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Funding
Sources of funds
Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and 
secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and 
off-balance sheet obligations, which includes both shortand long-term cash requirements.
The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse 
sources of funding including stable deposits, secured and 
unsecured funding in the capital markets and stockholders’ 
equity. Deposits are the primary funding source for 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. may access funding through short- or long-term 
secured borrowings, through the issuance of unsecured 
long-term debt, or from borrowings from the IHC. The 
Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries are primarily funded from 
long-term unsecured borrowings and short-term secured 
borrowings which are primarily securities loaned or sold 
under repurchase agreements. Excess funding is invested 
by Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment securities 
portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term liquid 
investments based on their interest rate and liquidity risk 
characteristics. 
Refer to Note 28 for additional information on off–balance 
sheet obligations.

Deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the 
Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A 
significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are consumer 
deposits and wholesale operating deposits, which are both 
considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale 
operating deposits are considered to be stable sources of 
liquidity because they are generated from customers that 
maintain operating service relationships with the Firm. 
The Firm believes that average deposit balances are 
generally more representative of deposit trends than 
period-end deposit balances. However, during periods of 
market disruption those trends could be affected.
Average deposits were higher for the year ended December 
31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, 
reflecting:
• growth in CCB from existing and new accounts across 
both consumer and small business customers, partially 
offset by a decline in deposits starting in the second half 
of 2022, impacted by growth in customer spending, and 
• net inflows in AWM resulting from the residual effects of 
certain government actions, partially offset by migration 
into investments starting in the second quarter of 2022 
as a result of the rising interest rate environment
partially offset by
• lower average deposits in CIB and CB due to attrition, also 
as a result of the rising interest rate environment. 
Period-end deposits decreased reflecting:
• attrition in CB and CIB, particularly non-operating 
deposits in CB, partially offset by net issuances of 
structured notes in Markets, 
• net outflows into investments in AWM amid the rising 
interest rate environment, and
• a decline in balances in existing accounts in CCB due to 
higher customer spending, predominantly offset by net 
inflows into new accounts.
The increase in deposits for both spot and averages in 
Corporate was driven by the Firm's international consumer 
growth initiatives.
Refer to the discussion of the Firm’s Consolidated Balance 
Sheets Analysis and the Business Segment Results on pages 
55-56 and pages 61-80, respectively, for further 
information on deposit and liability balance trends.
Certain deposits are covered by insurance protection that 
provides additional funding stability and results in a benefit 
to the LCR. Deposit insurance protection may be available 
to depositors in the countries in which the deposits are 
placed. For example, the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation (“FDIC”) provides deposit insurance protection 
for deposits placed in a U.S. depository institution. At 
December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Firmwide estimated 
uninsured deposits were $1,383.7 billion and $1,489.6 
billion, respectively, primarily reflecting wholesale 
operating deposits.

Total uninsured deposits include time deposits. The table 
below presents an estimate of uninsured U.S. and non-U.S. 
time deposits, and their remaining maturities. The Firm’s 
estimates of its uninsured U.S. time deposits are based on

Short-term funding 
The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding primarily 
consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to 
repurchase. These instruments are secured predominantly 
by high-quality securities collateral, including governmentissued debt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS. 
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased 
at December 31, 2022, compared with December 31, 
2021, due to higher secured financing of trading assets in 
Markets, partially offset by lower secured financing of AFS 
investment securities in Treasury and CIO. 
The balances associated with securities loaned or sold 
under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to 
investment and financing activities of clients, the Firm’s 
demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix 
of the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured 
financing (for both the investment securities and marketmaking portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors.
The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding 
primarily consist of issuances of wholesale commercial 
paper and other borrowed funds. 
The decrease in period-end commercial paper and the 
increase in average balances for the year ended 
December 31, 2022 compared to the respective prior year 
periods, was due to changes in net issuance levels primarily 
for short-term liquidity management.
Management’s discussion and analysis

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Long-term funding and issuance
Long-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term funding plan 
is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements, including TLAC. Long-term 
funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm 
evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan. 
The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide flexibility in 
support of the funding needs of both bank and non-bank subsidiaries. The Parent Company advances substantially all net 
funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external counterparties. The following table 
summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
Refer to Note 20 for additional information on the IHC and long-term debt.

Credit ratings
The cost and availability of financing are influenced by 
credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an 
adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources, 
increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or 
funding requirements and decrease the number of investors 
and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature 
and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades 
depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors,
which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk 
and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it 
maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential 
decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades.
Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and 
other third-party commitments may be adversely affected 
by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to liquidity risk and 
credit-related contingent features in Note 5 for additional 
information on the impact of a credit ratings downgrade on 
the funding requirements for VIEs, and on derivatives and 
collateral agreements.
The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of December 31, 2022,

On September 29, 2022, Moody’s upgraded the Parent 
Company’s long-term issuer rating to A1 (previously A2) 
and changed the long-term outlook to stable (previously 
positive). All other ratings and outlooks of the Parent 
Company and those of the Firm's principal bank and nonbank subsidiaries were affirmed by Moody's.
JPMorgan Chase’s unsecured debt does not contain 
requirements that would call for an acceleration of 
payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the 
existing debt, provide any limitations on future borrowings 
or require additional collateral, based on unfavorable 
changes in the Firm’s credit ratings, financial ratios, 
earnings, or stock price.
Critical factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a 
stable and diverse earnings stream, strong capital and 
liquidity ratios, strong credit quality and risk management 
controls, and diverse funding sources. Rating agencies 
continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, 
regulatory developments, future profitability, risk 
management practices, and litigation matters, as well as 
their broader ratings methodologies. Changes in any of 
these factors could lead to changes in the Firm’s credit 
ratings.

REPUTATION RISK MANAGEMENT
Reputation risk is the risk that an action or inaction may 
negatively impact perception of the Firm’s integrity and 
reduce confidence in the Firm’s competence by various 
constituents, including clients, counterparties, customers, 
investors, regulators, employees, communities or the 
broader public.
Organization and management 
Reputation Risk Management establishes the governance 
framework for managing reputation risk across the Firm’s 
LOBs and Corporate. Reputation risk is inherently 
challenging to identify, manage, and quantify.
The Firm’s reputation risk management function includes 
the following activities:
Maintaining a Firmwide Reputation Risk Governance 
policy and a standard consistent with the reputation 
risk framework 
Overseeing the governance execution through 
processes and infrastructure that support consistent 
identification, escalation, management and monitoring 
of reputation risk issues Firmwide
The types of events that result in reputation risk are wideranging and may be introduced by the Firm’s employees 
and the clients, customers and counterparties with which 
the Firm does business. These events could result in 
financial losses, litigation, regulatory enforcement actions, 
fines, penalties or other sanctions, as well as other harm to 
the Firm. 
Governance and oversight
The Reputation Risk Governance policy establishes the 
principles for managing reputation risk for the Firm. It is 
the responsibility of employees in each LOB and Corporate 
to consider the reputation of the Firm when deciding 
whether to offer a new product, engage in a transaction or 
client relationship, enter a new jurisdiction, initiate a 
business process or consider any other activity. 
Environmental impacts and social concerns are increasingly 
important considerations in assessing the Firm’s reputation 
risk, and are a component of the Firm’s reputation risk 
governance.
Reputation risk issues that are deemed to be material are 
escalated as appropriate.

CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT
Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the 
default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty 
or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected 
returns on investments, including consumer credit risk, 
wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk.
Credit risk management
Credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change 
in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer. The 
Firm provides credit to a variety of clients and customers, 
ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to 
individual consumers and small businesses. In its consumer 
businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily 
through its home lending, credit card, auto, and business 
banking businesses. In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is 
exposed to credit risk through its underwriting, lending, 
market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients 
and counterparties, as well as through its operating services 
activities (such as cash management and clearing 
activities), and securities financing activities. The Firm is 
also exposed to credit risk through its investment securities 
portfolio and cash placed with banks.
Credit Risk Management monitors, measures and manages 
credit risk throughout the Firm and defines credit risk 
policies and procedures. The Firm’s credit risk management 
governance includes the following activities:
• Maintaining a credit risk policy framework
• Monitoring, measuring and managing credit risk across 
all portfolio segments, including transaction and 
exposure approval
• Setting industry and geographic concentration limits, as 
appropriate, and establishing underwriting guidelines 
• Assigning and managing credit authorities in connection 
with the approval of credit exposure
• Managing criticized exposures and delinquent loans, and
• Estimating credit losses and supporting appropriate 
credit risk-based capital management
Risk identification and measurement
To measure credit risk, the Firm employs several 
methodologies for estimating the likelihood of obligor or 
counterparty default. Methodologies for measuring credit 
risk vary depending on several factors, including type of 
asset (e.g., consumer versus wholesale), risk measurement 
parameters (e.g., delinquency status and borrower’s credit 
score versus wholesale risk-rating) and risk management 
and collection processes (e.g., retail collection center 
versus centrally managed workout groups). Credit risk 
measurement is based on the probability of default of an 
obligor or counterparty, the loss severity given a default 
event and the exposure at default.
Based on these factors and the methodology and estimates 
described in Note 13 and Note 10, the Firm estimates credit 
losses for its exposures. The allowance for loan losses 
reflects estimated credit losses related to the consumer and 
wholesale held-for-investment loan portfolios, the 
allowance for lending-related commitments reflects 
estimated credit losses related to the Firm’s lending-related 
commitments and the allowance for investment securities 
reflects estimated credit losses related to the investment 
securities portfolio. Refer to Note 13, Note 10 and Critical 
Accounting Estimates used by the Firm on pages 149-152 
for further information.
In addition, potential and unexpected credit losses are 
reflected in the allocation of credit risk capital and 
represent the potential volatility of actual losses relative to 
the established allowances for loan losses and lendingrelated commitments. The analyses for these losses include 
stress testing that considers alternative economic scenarios 
as described below.
Stress testing
Stress testing is important in measuring and managing 
credit risk in the Firm’s credit portfolio. The stress testing 
process assesses the potential impact of alternative 
economic and business scenarios on estimated credit losses 
for the Firm. Economic scenarios and the underlying 
parameters are defined centrally, articulated in terms of 
macroeconomic factors and applied across the businesses. 
The stress test results may indicate credit migration, 
changes in delinquency trends and potential losses in the 
credit portfolio. In addition to the periodic stress testing 
processes, management also considers additional stresses 
outside these scenarios, including industry and countryspecific stress scenarios, as necessary. The Firm uses stress 
testing to inform decisions on setting risk appetite both at a 
Firm and LOB level, as well as to assess the impact of stress 
on individual counterparties.
Management’s discussion and analysis

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Risk monitoring and management
The Firm has developed policies and practices that are 
designed to preserve the independence and integrity of the 
approval and decision-making process for extending credit 
so that credit risks are assessed accurately, approved 
properly, monitored regularly and managed actively at both 
the transaction and portfolio levels. The policy framework 
establishes credit approval authorities, concentration limits, 
risk-rating methodologies, portfolio review parameters and 
guidelines for management of distressed exposures. In 
addition, certain models, assumptions and inputs used in 
evaluating and monitoring credit risk are independently 
validated by groups that are separate from the LOBs.
Consumer credit risk is monitored for delinquency and 
other trends, including any concentrations at the portfolio 
level, as certain of these trends can be addressed through 
changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. 
Consumer Risk Management evaluates delinquency and 
other trends against business expectations, current and 
forecasted economic conditions, and industry benchmarks. 
Historical and forecasted economic performance and trends 
are incorporated into the modeling of estimated consumer 
credit losses and are part of the monitoring of the credit 
risk profile of the portfolio. 
Wholesale credit risk is monitored regularly at an aggregate 
portfolio, industry, and individual client and counterparty 
level with established concentration limits that are 
reviewed and revised periodically as deemed appropriate 
by management. Industry and counterparty limits, as 
measured in terms of exposure and economic risk appetite, 
are subject to stress-based loss constraints. Wrong-way risk 
is the risk that exposure to a counterparty is positively 
correlated with the impact of a default by the same 
counterparty, which could cause exposure to increase at the 
same time as the counterparty’s capacity to meet its 
obligations is decreasing.
Management of the Firm’s wholesale credit risk exposure is 
accomplished through a number of means, including:
• Loan underwriting and credit approval processes
• Loan syndications and participations
• Loan sales and securitizations
• Credit derivatives
• Master netting agreements, and
• Collateral and other risk-reduction techniques
In addition to Credit Risk Management, an independent 
Credit Review function is responsible for: 
• Independently validating or changing the risk grades 
assigned to exposures in the Firm’s wholesale credit 
portfolio, and assessing the timeliness of risk grade 
changes initiated by responsible business units; and 
• Evaluating the effectiveness of the credit management 
processes of the LOBs and Corporate, including the 
adequacy of credit analyses and risk grading/loss given 
default (“LGD”) rationales, proper monitoring and 
management of credit exposures, and compliance with 
applicable grading policies and underwriting guidelines. 
Refer to Note 12 for further discussion of consumer and 
wholesale loans.
Risk reporting
To enable monitoring of credit risk and effective decisionmaking, aggregate credit exposure, credit quality forecasts, 
concentration levels and risk profile changes are reported 
regularly to senior members of Credit Risk Management. 
Detailed portfolio reporting of industry, clients, 
counterparties and customers, product and geography are 
prepared, and the appropriateness of the allowance for 
credit losses is reviewed by senior management at least on 
a quarterly basis. Through the risk reporting and 
governance structure, credit risk trends and limit 
exceptions are provided regularly to, and discussed with, 
risk committees, senior management and the Board of 
Directors.

Maturities and sensitivity to changes in interest rates
The table below sets forth loan maturities by scheduled repayments, by class of loan and the distribution between fixed and 
floating interest rates based on the stated terms of the loan agreements. Effective December 31, 2022, the Firm revised its 
methodology from contractual maturities to scheduled repayments. The Firm estimated the principal repayment amounts for 
both the residential real estate and auto and other loan classes by calculating the weighted-average loan balance and interest 
rates for loan pools based on remaining loan term.

Consumer, excluding credit card
Portfolio analysis
Loans decreased from December 31, 2021 driven by 
residential real estate loans at fair value and auto and other 
loans, largely offset by higher retained residential real 
estate loans.
The following discussions provide information concerning 
individual loan products. Refer to Note 12 for further 
information about this portfolio, including information 
about delinquencies, loan modifications and other credit 
quality indicators.
Residential real estate: The residential real estate 
portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair 
value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and 
home equity lines of credit. 
Retained loans increased compared to December 31, 2021 
reflecting originations, net of paydowns. Retained 
nonaccrual loans decreased from December 31, 2021 
reflecting improved credit performance and loan sales. Net 
recoveries were lower for the year ended December 31, 
2022 compared to the prior year driven by lower 
prepayments due to higher interest rates, partially offset by 
lower gross charge-offs.
Loans at fair value decreased from December 31, 2021, as 
warehouse loan sales in Home Lending outpaced 
originations due to higher interest rates and loan sales in 
CIB outpaced loan purchase activity. Nonaccrual loans at 
fair value decreased from December 31, 2021 driven by 
net portfolio activity in CIB.
The carrying value of home equity lines of credit 
outstanding was $15.7 billion at December 31, 2022. This 
amount included $5.1 billion of HELOCs that have recast 
from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have 
been modified and $5.0 billion of interest-only balloon 
HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm 
manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by 
closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent 
permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material 
deterioration in their credit risk profile. 
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying value of 
interest-only residential mortgage loans were $36.3 billion 
and $30.0 billion, respectively. These loans have an 
interest-only payment period generally followed by an 
adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment 
period to maturity and are typically originated as higherbalance loans to higher-income borrowers, predominantly 
in AWM. The interest-only residential mortgage loan 
portfolio reflected net recoveries for the year ended 
December 31, 2022. The credit performance of this 
portfolio is comparable with the performance of the 
broader prime mortgage portfolio.
The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s
residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed
by U.S. government agencies, predominantly loans held-forsale and loans at fair value. The Firm monitors its exposure 
to certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related 
to government-insured loans and considers this exposure in 
estimating the allowance for loan losses.

Geographic composition and current estimated loan-tovalue ratio of residential real estate loans
At December 31, 2022, $152.7 billion, or 64% of the total 
retained residential real estate loan portfolio, excluding 
mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies, were 
concentrated in California, New York, Florida, Texas and 
Illinois, compared with $145.5 billion, or 65% at 
December 31, 2021.
Average current estimated loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios 
were relatively flat.
Refer to Note 12 for information on the geographic 
composition and current estimated LTVs of the Firm’s 
residential real estate loans.
Modified residential real estate loans
The following table presents information relating to 
modified retained residential real estate loans for which 
concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing 
financial difficulty, which include both TDRs and modified 
PCD loans not accounted for as TDRs. The following table 
does not include loans with short-term or other insignificant 
modifications that are not considered concessions and, 
therefore, are not TDRs. Refer to Note 12 for further 
information on modifications for the years ended 
December 31, 2022 and 2021.

modified in a TDR that are on nonaccrual status.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio, 
including loans at fair value consists of prime-quality scored 
auto and business banking loans, as well as overdrafts. The 
portfolio decreased when compared with December 31, 
2021 due to paydowns of scored Auto loans and PPP loan 
forgiveness in Business Banking predominantly offset by 
originations of scored Auto loans. Net charge-offs for the 
year ended December 31, 2022 increased compared to the 
prior year due to higher scored Auto and overdraft chargeoffs, as the prior year benefited from government stimulus 
and payment assistance programs. The scored Auto net 
charge-off rates were 0.24% and 0.04% for the years 
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Management’s discussion and analysis

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Credit card
Total credit card loans increased from December 31, 2021 
driven by growth in balances on higher consumer spending 
and net new originations. The December 31, 2022 30+ and 
90+ day delinquency rates of 1.45% and 0.68%, 
respectively, increased compared to the December 31, 
2021 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.04% and 
0.50%, but remain below pre-pandemic levels. Net chargeoffs decreased for the year ended December 31, 2022 
compared to the prior year. Delinquency and net charge-off 
rates continue to benefit from the ongoing financial 
strength of U.S. consumers. However, median deposit 
balances declined in the second half of 2022, impacted by 
the growth in consumer spending.
Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans 
typically remain on accrual status until charged off. 
However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses includes the 
estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed 
interest and fee income. 
Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans
At December 31, 2022, $85.4 billion, or 46% of the total 
retained credit card loan portfolio, was concentrated in 
California, Texas, New York, Florida and Illinois, compared 
with $70.5 billion, or 46%, at December 31, 2021. 
Modifications of credit card loans
At December 31, 2022, the Firm had $796 million of credit 
card loans outstanding that have been modified in TDRs, 
compared to $1.0 billion at December 31, 2021. These 
TDRs do not include loans with short-term or other 
insignificant modifications that are not considered TDRs. 
Refer to Note 12 for further information about this 
portfolio, including information about delinquencies, 
geographic and FICO composition, and modifications.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit 
risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, marketmaking, and hedging activities with and for clients and 
counterparties, as well as through various operating 
services (such as cash management and clearing activities), 
securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. A 
portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s 
wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance 
sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the 
loans that it originates into the market as part of its 
syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio 
concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is 
actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth 
reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure, 
inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, 
product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry 
discussion on pages 118-121 for further information.
The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held 
in CIB, CB, AWM, and Corporate, as well as the risk-rated 
BWM and auto dealer exposure held in CCB, for which the 
wholesale methodology is applied when determining the 
allowance for loan losses.
In 2022, wholesale credit continued to perform well with 
charge-offs remaining low. 
As of December 31, 2022, retained loans increased by 
$43.3 billion driven by CIB and CB, including higher 
revolver utilization, partially offset by a decline in AWM. 
Lending-related commitments decreased $14.5 billion, 
driven by net portfolio activity in CIB, including a decrease 
in held-for-sale positions in the bridge financing portfolio, 
largely offset by net portfolio activity in AWM and CB.
As of December 31, 2022, the investment-grade 
percentage of the portfolio remained relatively flat at 70%, 
while criticized exposure decreased by $6.9 billion from 
$38.2 billion to $31.3 billion. As of December 31, 2022, 
nonperforming exposure decreased by $406.0 million 
driven by a decline in lending-related commitments in CIB 
and loans in AWM as a result of client-specific upgrades, 
paydowns and cancelled commitments, largely offset by 
client-specific downgrades in CIB including downgrades to 
certain Russia and Russia-associated clients in the first 
quarter of 2022. Refer to Business Developments on page 
50 and Country Risk on pages 139-140 for additional 
information. Refer to Wholesale credit exposure – industry

(a) Loans held-for-sale are primarily related to syndicated loans and loans transferred from the retained portfolio.
(b) These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP.
(c) The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference entity and the ratings profile shown is based on the ratings of the reference 
entity on which protection has been purchased. Predominantly all of the credit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased protection used 
in credit portfolio management activities are executed with investment-grade counterparties. In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection against 
certain loans in the retained loan portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes. 
(d) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.
(e) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is generally based on remaining contractual 
maturity. Derivative contracts that are in a receivable position at December 31, 2022, may become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow 
profile or changes in market conditions.

Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to industries 
with actual or potential credit concerns.
Exposures that are deemed to be criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which 
consist of the special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized exposure, excluding loans held-for-sale 
and loans at fair value, was $31.3 billion at December 31, 2022 and $38.2 billion at December 31, 2021, representing 
approximately 2.7% and 3.5% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively. Criticized exposure decreased driven by net 
portfolio activity and client-specific upgrades concentrated in Consumer & Retail, Technology, Media & Telecommunications 
and Real Estate, largely offset by client-specific downgrades. Of the $31.3 billion of criticized exposure at December 31, 2022, 
approximately half was undrawn and $28.6 billion was performing.
The table below summarizes by industry the Firm’s exposures as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The industry of risk 
category is generally based on the client or counterparty’s primary business activity. Refer to Note 4 for additional information 
on industry concentrations.

Lending-related commitments
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as 
commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and 
guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients. The 
contractual amounts of these financial instruments 
represent the maximum possible credit risk should the 
clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm 
fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the 
clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms 
of these contracts. Most of these commitments and 
guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, 
cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default 
occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the 
total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related 
commitments is representative of the Firm’s expected 
future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to 
Note 28 for further information on wholesale lendingrelated commitments.
Receivables from customers
Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment 
margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that 
are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’ 
brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, and liquid and 
readily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of 
this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is 
generally held against these receivables. To manage its 
credit risk, the Firm establishes margin requirements and 
monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, 
and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other 
collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These 
receivables are reported within accrued interest and 
accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance 
sheets.
Derivative contracts
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage 
risk, including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations 
in interest rates, foreign exchange and equities and 
commodities prices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives 
in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to 
manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions 
from its market-making activities, including the 
counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. 
The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own 
credit risk and other market risk exposure. The nature of the 
counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the 
derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. 
For OTC derivatives, the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of 
the derivative counterparty. For exchange-traded 
derivatives (“ETD”), such as futures and options, and 
cleared over-the-counter (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the 
Firm can also be exposed to the credit risk of the relevant 
CCP. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit 
risk exposures arising from derivative contracts through the 
use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and 
collateral agreements. The percentage of the Firm’s OTC 
derivative transactions subject to collateral agreements — 
excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not 
typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short 
maturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily — 
was approximately 87% and 88% at December 31, 2022 
and 2021, respectively. Refer to Note 5 for additional 
information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements and 
further discussion of derivative contracts, counterparties 
and settlement types.
The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the 
Consolidated balance sheets were $70.9 billion and $57.1 
billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The 
increase was primarily driven by higher foreign exchange as 
a result of market movements. Derivative receivables 
represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after 
giving effect to legally enforceable master netting 
agreements and the related cash collateral held by the 
Firm.
In addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other cash 
collateral that may be used as security when the fair value 
of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor. For these 
purposes, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with 
the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the 
LCR rule.
In management’s view, the appropriate measure of current 
credit risk should also take into consideration other 
collateral, which generally represents securities that do not 
qualify as high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The 
benefits of these additional collateral amounts for each 
counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable master 
netting agreement and limited to the net amount of the 
derivative receivables for each counterparty.
The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 
government securities, other liquid government agency and 
guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity 
securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of 
transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that 
have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm 
has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the 
reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the 
balances and is not included in the tables below, it is 
available as security against potential exposure that could 
arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative contracts 
move in the Firm’s favor. Refer to Note 5 for additional 
information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements.

While useful as a current view of credit exposure, the net 
fair value of the derivative receivables does not capture the 
potential future variability of that credit exposure. To 
capture the potential future variability of credit exposure, 
the Firm calculates, on a client-by-client basis, three 
measures of potential derivatives-related credit loss: Peak, 
Derivative Risk Equivalent (“DRE”), and Average exposure 
(“AVG”). These measures all incorporate netting and 
collateral benefits, where applicable.
Peak represents a conservative measure of potential 
derivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, to a 
counterparty calculated in a manner that is broadly 
equivalent to a 97.5% confidence level over the life of the 
transaction. Peak is the primary measure used by the Firm 
for setting credit limits for derivative contracts, senior 
management reporting and derivatives exposure 
management.
DRE exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of 
derivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, on a 
basis intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan 
exposures. DRE is a less extreme measure of potential 
credit loss than Peak and is used as an input for 
aggregating derivative credit risk exposures with loans and 
other credit risk.
Finally, AVG is a measure of the expected fair value of the 
Firm’s derivative exposure, including the benefit of 
collateral, at future time periods. AVG over the total life of 
the derivative contract is used as the primary metric for 
pricing purposes and is used to calculate credit risk capital 
and CVA, as further described below. 
The fair value of the Firm’s derivative receivables 
incorporates CVA to reflect the credit quality of 
counterparties. CVA is based on the Firm’s AVG to a 
counterparty and the counterparty’s credit spread in the 
credit derivatives market. The Firm believes that active risk 
management is essential to controlling the dynamic credit 
risk in the derivatives portfolio. In addition, the Firm’s risk 
management process for derivatives exposures takes into 
consideration the potential impact of wrong-way risk, which 
is broadly defined as the risk that exposure to a 
counterparty is positively correlated with the impact of a 
default by the same counterparty, which could cause 
exposure to increase at the same time as the counterparty’s 
capacity to meet its obligations is decreasing. Many factors 
may influence the nature and magnitude of these 
correlations over time. To the extent that these correlations 
are identified, the Firm may adjust the CVA associated with 
a particular counterparty’s AVG. The Firm risk manages 
exposure to changes in CVA by entering into credit 
derivative contracts, as well as interest rate, foreign 
exchange, equity and commodity derivative contracts.
The below graph shows exposure profiles to the Firm’s 
current derivatives portfolio over the next 10 years as 
calculated by the Peak, DRE and AVG metrics. The three 
measures generally show that exposure will decline after 
the first year, if no new trades are added to the portfolio.

Credit derivatives
The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: 
first, in its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an 
end-user to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated 
with various exposures.
Credit portfolio management activities
Included in the Firm’s end-user activities are credit 
derivatives used to mitigate the credit risk associated with 
traditional lending activities (loans and lending-related 
commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the 
Firm’s wholesale businesses (collectively, “credit portfolio 
management activities”). Information on credit portfolio 
management activities is provided in the table below. 
The Firm also uses credit derivatives as an end-user to 
manage other exposures, including credit risk arising from 
certain securities held in the Firm’s market-making 
businesses. These credit derivatives are not included in 
credit portfolio management activities.

The credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management 
activities do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. 
GAAP; these derivatives are reported at fair value, with 
gains and losses recognized in principal transactions 
revenue. In contrast, the loans and lending-related 
commitments being risk-managed are accounted for on an 
accrual basis. This asymmetry in accounting treatment, 
between loans and lending-related commitments and the 
credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management 
activities, causes earnings volatility that is not 
representative, in the Firm’s view, of the true changes in 
value of the Firm’s overall credit exposure.
The effectiveness of credit default swaps (“CDS”) as a hedge 
against the Firm’s exposures may vary depending on a 
number of factors, including the named reference entity 
(i.e., the Firm may experience losses on specific exposures 
that are different than the named reference entities in the 
purchased CDS); the contractual terms of the CDS (which 
may have a defined credit event that does not align with an 
actual loss realized by the Firm); and the maturity of the 
Firm’s CDS protection (which in some cases may be shorter 
than the Firm’s exposures). However, the Firm generally 
seeks to purchase credit protection with a maturity date 
that is the same or similar to the maturity date of the 
exposure for which the protection was purchased, and 
remaining differences in maturity are actively monitored 
and managed by the Firm. Refer to Credit derivatives in 
Note 5 for further information on credit derivatives and 
derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities.
Management’s discussion and analysis

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents 
management's estimate of expected credit losses over the 
remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets 
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet 
lending-related commitments. The Firm’s allowance for 
credit losses comprises:
• the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s 
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is 
presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,
• the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is 
reflected in accounts payable and other liabilities on the 
Consolidated balance sheets, and
• the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, 
which is reflected in investment securities on the 
Consolidated balance sheets.
Discussion of changes in the allowance
The allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2022 
was $22.2 billion, reflecting a net addition of $3.5 billion 
from December 31, 2021, consisting of: 
• $2.3 billion in wholesale, driven by deterioration in the 
Firm’s macroeconomic outlook and loan growth, 
predominantly in CB and CIB, and
• $1.2 billion in consumer, predominantly driven by Card 
Services, reflecting higher outstanding balances and 
deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, 
partially offset by a reduction in the allowance related to 
a decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower 
behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede. 
Deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook included 
both updates to the central scenario in the fourth quarter of 
2022, which now reflects a mild recession, as well as the 
impact of the increased weight placed on the adverse 
scenarios beginning in the first quarter of 2022 due to the 
effects associated with higher inflation, changes in 
monetary policy, and geopolitical risks, including the war in 
Ukraine. 
The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a 
weighted average of five internally developed 
macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios 
incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the 
central case assumptions provided in the table below, 
resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate 
peaking at 5.6% in the second quarter of 2024, and a 
1.2% lower U.S. real GDP exiting the second quarter of 
2024.
The Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S. 
unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:

Subsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates
will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future
periods.

 INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT 
Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss 
of principal or a reduction in expected returns on 
investments arising from the investment securities portfolio 
or from principal investments. The investment securities 
portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in 
connection with the Firm's balance sheet and asset-liability 
management objectives. Principal investments are 
predominantly privately-held financial instruments and are 
managed in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are 
typically intended to be held over extended periods and, 
accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term 
realized gains with respect to these investments.
Investment securities risk 
Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated 
with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This 
risk is mitigated given that the investment securities 
portfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly consists 
of high-quality securities. At December 31, 2022, the 
Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of the 
allowance for credit losses, was $629.3 billion, and the 
average credit rating of the securities comprising the 
portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where 
available, and where not available, based primarily upon 
internal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on 
pages 79-80 and Note 10 for further information on the 
investment securities portfolio and internal risk ratings. 
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 for 
further information on related liquidity risk. Refer to Market 
Risk Management on pages 131-138 for further 
information on the market risk inherent in the portfolio.
Governance and oversight
Investment securities risks are governed by the Firm’s Risk 
Appetite framework, and reviewed at the CTC Risk 
Committee with regular updates provided to the Board Risk 
Committee. 
The Firm’s independent control functions are responsible 
for reviewing the appropriateness of the carrying value of 
investment securities in accordance with relevant policies. 
Approved levels for investment securities are established 
for each risk category, including capital and credit risks.
Principal investment risk 
Principal investments are typically privately-held financial 
instruments representing ownership interests or other 
forms of junior capital. In general, principal investments 
include tax-oriented investments and investments made to 
enhance or accelerate the Firm’s business strategies and 
exclude those that are consolidated on the Firm's balance 
sheets. These investments are made by dedicated investing 
businesses or as part of a broader business strategy. The 
Firm’s principal investments are managed by the LOBs and 
Corporate and are reflected within their respective financial 
results. The Firm’s investments will continue to evolve in 
line with its strategies, including the Firm’s commitment to 
support underserved communities and minority-owned 
businesses.

The Firm’s approach to managing principal risk is consistent 
with the Firm’s risk governance structure. The Firm has 
established a Firmwide risk policy framework for all 
principal investing activities that includes approval by 
executives who are independent from the investing 
businesses, as appropriate. 
The Firm’s independent control functions are responsible 
for reviewing the appropriateness of the carrying value of 
investments in accordance with relevant policies. As part of 
the risk governance structure, approved levels for 
investments are established and monitored for each 
relevant business or segment in order to manage the 
overall size of the portfolios. The Firm also conducts stress 
testing on these portfolios using specific scenarios that 
estimate losses based on significant market moves and/or 
other risk events.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT
Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes 
in market factors such as interest and foreign exchange 
rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or 
implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held 
for both the short and long term. 
Market Risk Management
Market Risk Management monitors market risks throughout 
the Firm and defines market risk policies and procedures. 
Market Risk Management seeks to manage risk, facilitate 
efficient risk/return decisions, reduce volatility in operating 
performance and provide transparency into the Firm’s 
market risk profile for senior management, the Board of 
Directors and regulators. Market Risk Management is 
responsible for the following functions:
• Maintaining a market risk policy framework
• Independently measuring, monitoring and controlling 
LOB, Corporate, and Firmwide market risk
• Defining, approving and monitoring of limits
• Performing stress testing and qualitative risk 
assessments
Risk measurement
Measures used to capture market risk 
There is no single measure to capture market risk and 
therefore Market Risk Management uses various metrics, 
both statistical and nonstatistical, to assess risk including:
• Value-at-risk (VaR) 
• Stress testing
• Profit and loss drawdowns 
• Earnings-at-risk 
• Other sensitivity-based measures
Risk monitoring and control 
Market risk exposure is managed primarily through a series 
of limits set in the context of the market environment and 
business strategy. In setting limits, Market Risk 
Management takes into consideration factors such as 
market volatility, product liquidity, accommodation of client 
business, and management judgment. Market Risk 
Management maintains different levels of limits. Firm level 
limits include VaR and stress limits. Similarly, LOB and 
Corporate limits include VaR and stress limits and may be 
supplemented by certain nonstatistical risk measures such 
as profit and loss drawdowns. Limits may also be set within 
the LOBs and Corporate, as well as at the legal entity level.
Market Risk Management sets limits and regularly reviews 
and updates them as appropriate. Senior management is 
responsible for reviewing and approving certain of these 
risk limits on an ongoing basis. Limits that have not been 
reviewed within specified time periods by Market Risk 
Management are reported to senior management. The LOBs 
and Corporate are responsible for adhering to established 
limits against which exposures are monitored and reported.
Limit breaches are required to be reported in a timely 
manner to limit approvers, which include Market Risk 
Management and senior management. In the event of a 
breach, Market Risk Management consults with senior 
members of appropriate groups within the Firm to 
determine the suitable course of action required to return 
the applicable positions to compliance, which may include a 
reduction in risk in order to remedy the breach or granting 
a temporary increase in limits to accommodate an expected 
increase in client activity and/or market volatility. Certain 
Firm, Corporate or LOB-level limit breaches are escalated as 
appropriate.
Models used to measure market risk are inherently 
imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure certain 
risks or to predict losses. This imprecision may be 
heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market 
conditions occur. For additional discussion on model 
uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk 
Management on page 148.
Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s 
existing market risk measures to identify opportunities for 
enhancement, and to the extent appropriate, will calibrate 
those measures accordingly over time.

Management’s discussion and analysis

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Value-at-risk
JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a statistical 
risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse 
market moves in the current market environment. The Firm 
has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating 
Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR.
The framework is employed across the Firm using historical 
simulation based on data for the previous 12 months. The 
framework’s approach assumes that historical changes in 
market values are representative of the distribution of 
potential outcomes in the immediate future. The Firm 
believes the use of Risk Management VaR provides a daily 
measure of risk that is closely aligned to risk management 
decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate and, along with 
other market risk measures, provides the appropriate 
information needed to respond to risk events. 
The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a 
one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss 
methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level. 
Risk Management VaR provides a consistent framework to 
measure risk profiles and levels of diversification across 
product types and is used for aggregating risks and 
monitoring limits across businesses. VaR results are 
reported to senior management, the Board of Directors and 
regulators. 
Underlying the overall VaR model framework are individual 
VaR models that simulate historical market returns for 
individual risk factors and/or product types. To capture 
material market risks as part of the Firm’s risk management 
framework, comprehensive VaR model calculations are 
performed daily for businesses whose activities give rise to 
market risk. These VaR models are granular and 
incorporate numerous risk factors and inputs to simulate 
daily changes in market values over the historical period; 
inputs are selected based on the risk profile of each 
portfolio, as sensitivities and historical time series used to 
generate daily market values may be different across 
product types or risk management systems. The VaR model 
results across all portfolios are aggregated at the Firm 
level.
As VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect 
measure of market risk exposure and potential future 
losses. In addition, based on their reliance on available 
historical data, limited time horizons, and other factors, 
VaR measures are inherently limited in their ability to 
measure certain risks and to predict losses, particularly 
those associated with market illiquidity and sudden or 
severe shifts in market conditions. 
For certain products, specific risk parameters are not 
captured in VaR due to the lack of liquidity and availability 
of appropriate historical data. The Firm uses proxies to 
estimate the VaR for these and other products when daily 
time series are not available. It is likely that using an actual 
price-based time series for these products, if available, 
would affect the VaR results presented. The Firm therefore 
considers other nonstatistical measures such as stress 
testing, in addition to VaR, to capture and manage its 
market risk positions. 
The daily market data used in VaR models may be different 
than the independent third-party data collected for VCG 
price testing in its monthly valuation process. For example, 
in cases where market prices are not observable, or where 
proxies are used in VaR historical time series, the data 
sources may differ. Refer to Valuation process in Note 2 for 
further information on the Firm’s valuation process. As VaR 
model calculations require daily data and a consistent 
source for valuation, it may not be practical to use the data 
collected in the VCG monthly valuation process for VaR 
model calculations. 
The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically 
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the 
composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market 
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling 
techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such 
changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results. 
Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 
148 for information regarding model reviews and 
approvals.
The Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR in 
accordance with regulatory rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which 
is used to derive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital 
requirements under Basel III capital rules. This Regulatory 
VaR model framework currently assumes a ten business-day 
holding period and an expected tail loss methodology which 
approximates a 99% confidence level. Regulatory VaR is 
applied to “covered” positions as defined by Basel III capital 
rules, which may be different than the positions included in 
the Firm’s Risk Management VaR. For example, credit 
derivative hedges of accrual loans are included in the Firm’s 
Risk Management VaR, while Regulatory VaR excludes these 
credit derivative hedges. In addition, in contrast to the 
Firm’s Risk Management VaR, Regulatory VaR currently 
excludes the diversification benefit for certain VaR models.
Refer to JPMorgan Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory 
Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the 
Firm’s website, for additional information on Regulatory 
VaR and the other components of market risk regulatory 
capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed 
VaR-based measure and the respective backtesting).

(a) Diversification benefit represents the difference between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its individual components. This reflects the non-additive nature 
of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and risk types.
(b) In the first quarter of 2022, in line with the Firm's internal model governance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties was 
removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening of the credit spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also 
removed to maintain consistency. This exposure is now reflected in other sensitivity-based measures.
(c) In March 2022, the effects of nickel price increases and the associated volatility in the nickel market resulted in elevated average and maximum Credit 
Portfolio VaR.
(d) The decrease in Corporate and other LOB VaR was driven by lower market values for a legacy private equity position in Corporate which is publicly traded.
(e) The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components, and consequently, diversification 
benefit is not meaningful.
Average Total VaR increased by $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 when compared with the prior year. The 
increase was driven by the effects of nickel price increases and the associated volatility in the nickel market observed in March 
2022 impacting Credit Portfolio VaR, predominantly offset by a decrease in Corporate and other LOB VaR.
The following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR for the four trailing quarters. The movement in VaR in March 2022 
was driven by changes in nickel-related counterparty exposure in the Firm's Credit Portfolio.

VaR backtesting
The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily gains 
and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below do not reflect the 
Firm’s reported revenue as they exclude certain components of total net revenue, such as those associated with the execution 
of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, other 
valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded components of total net revenue may more than offset the 
backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the 
requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.
A backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior day. 
Under the Firm’s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent with the 
historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions five times every 100 
trading days on average. The number of VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the statistically expected number 
of backtesting exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially different from the level of market volatility 
during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR calculation.
For the 12 months ended December 31, 2022, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 136 of the 259 days, and observed 17 
VaR backtesting exceptions. Firmwide backtesting loss days can differ from the loss days for which Fixed Income Markets and 
Equity Markets posted losses, as disclosed in CIB Markets revenue, as the population of positions which compose each metric 
are different and due to the exclusion of certain components of total net revenue in backtesting gains and losses as described 
above. For more information on CIB Markets revenue, refer to pages 70-71.
The following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12 months and 
three months ended December 31, 2022. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the corresponding 
daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point 
intervals. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one hundred percent. The results in 
the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 
Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm’s covered positions.

Other risk measures 
Stress testing 
Along with VaR, stress testing is an important tool used to 
assess risk. While VaR reflects the risk of loss due to 
adverse changes in markets using recent historical market 
behavior, stress testing reflects the risk of loss from 
hypothetical changes in the value of market risk sensitive 
positions applied simultaneously. Stress testing measures 
the Firm’s vulnerability to losses under a range of stressed 
but possible economic and market scenarios. The results 
are used to understand the exposures responsible for those 
potential losses and are measured against limits. 
The Firm’s stress framework covers market risk sensitive 
positions in the LOBs and Corporate. The framework is used 
to calculate multiple magnitudes of potential stress for both 
market rallies and market sell-offs, assuming significant 
changes in market factors such as credit spreads, equity 
prices, interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, 
and combines them in multiple ways to capture an array of 
hypothetical economic and market scenarios. 
The Firm generates a number of scenarios that focus on tail 
events in specific asset classes and geographies, including 
how the event may impact multiple market factors 
simultaneously. Scenarios also incorporate specific 
idiosyncratic risks and stress basis risk between different 
products. The flexibility in the stress framework allows the 
Firm to construct new scenarios that can test the outcomes 
against possible future stress events. Stress testing results 
are reported periodically to senior management of the 
Firm, as appropriate. 
Stress scenarios are governed by the overall stress 
framework, under the oversight of Market Risk 
Management, and the models to calculate the stress results 
are subject to the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk 
Management Policy. The Firmwide Market Risk Stress 
Methodology Committee reviews and approves changes to 
stress testing methodology and scenarios across the Firm. 
Significant changes to the framework are escalated to 
senior management, as appropriate. 
The Firm’s stress testing framework is utilized in calculating 
the Firm’s CCAR and other stress test results, which are 
reported periodically to the Board of Directors. In addition, 
stress testing results are incorporated into the Firm’s Risk 
Appetite framework, and are reported periodically to the 
Board Risk Committee. 
Profit and loss drawdowns 
Profit and loss drawdowns are used to highlight trading 
losses above certain levels of risk tolerance. A profit and 
loss drawdown is a decline in revenue from its year-to-date 
peak level.
Earnings-at-risk
The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported 
net income is important as interest rate risk represents one 
of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk 
arises not only from trading activities but also from the 
Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include 
extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits, 
issuing debt and the investment securities portfolio. Refer 
to the table on page 132 for a summary by LOB and 
Corporate, identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk.
The CTC Risk Committee establishes the Firm’s structural 
interest rate risk policy and related limits, which are subject 
to approval by the Board Risk Committee. Treasury and CIO, 
working in partnership with the LOBs, calculates the Firm’s 
structural interest rate risk profile and reviews it with 
senior management, including the CTC Risk Committee. In 
addition, oversight of structural interest rate risk is 
managed through a dedicated risk function reporting to the 
CTC CRO. This risk function is responsible for providing 
independent oversight and governance around assumptions 
and establishing and monitoring limits for structural 
interest rate risk. The Firm manages structural interest rate 
risk generally through its investment securities portfolio 
and interest rate derivatives.
Structural interest rate risk can arise due to a variety of 
factors, including:
• Differences in timing among the maturity or repricing of 
assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments
• Differences in the amounts of assets, liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments that are maturing or repricing 
at the same time
• Differences in the amounts by which short-term and longterm market interest rates change (for example, changes 
in the slope of the yield curve)
• The impact of changes in the maturity of various assets, 
liabilities or off-balance sheet instruments as interest 
rates change
The Firm manages interest rate exposure related to its 
assets and liabilities on a consolidated, Firmwide basis. 
Business units transfer their interest rate risk to Treasury 
and CIO through funds transfer pricing, which takes into 
account the elements of interest rate exposure that can be 
risk-managed in financial markets. These elements include 
asset and liability balances and contractual rates of 
interest, contractual principal payment schedules, expected 
prepayment experience, interest rate reset dates and 
maturities, rate indices used for repricing, and any interest 
rate ceilings or floors for adjustable rate products.
One way that the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate 
risk is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates 
the Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate 
scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which 
includes net interest income and certain interest rate 
sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and, 
in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm 
conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest 
rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. 
dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). 
These simulations primarily include retained loans, 
Management’s discussion and analysis

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, longterm debt and any related interest rate hedges, and funds 
transfer pricing of other positions in risk management VaR 
and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page 
132. 
Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to 
a net interest income baseline over the following 12 months 
utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios include a 
parallel shift involving changes to both short-term and longterm rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield curve 
involving holding short-term rates constant and increasing 
long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve involving 
increasing short-term rates and holding long-term rates 
constant or holding short-term rates constant and 
decreasing long-term rates. These scenarios consider many 
different factors, including: 
• The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous 
changes in interest rates from baseline rates.
• Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled 
prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding 
assumptions about actions that could be taken by the 
Firm or its clients and customers in response to 
instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment 
assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the 
scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates, 
the time since origination, and other factors which are 
updated periodically based on historical experience. 
Deposit forecasts are a key assumption in the Firm’s 
earnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects certain 
assumptions relating to the reversal of Quantitative 
Easing that are highly uncertain and require management 
judgment. Therefore, the actual amount of deposits held 
by the Firm, at any particular time, could be impacted by 
actions the Federal Reserve may take as part of monetary 
policy, including through the use of the Reverse 
Repurchase Facility. In addition, there are other factors 
that impact the amount of deposits held at the Firm such 
as the level of loans across the industry and competition 
for deposits.
• The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit 
betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates paid 
could change upon a given change in market interest 
rates. The deposit rates paid in these scenarios differ 
from actual deposit rates paid, due to repricing lags and 
other factors.
The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically 
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the 
composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market 
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and 
other factors. The Firm is currently evaluating the modeling 
of repricing lags for deposits in its earnings-at-risk 
scenarios. Incorporating repricing lags, in the current 
environment, would significantly affect the U.S. dollar 
interest rate scenarios, with higher interest rate scenarios 
expected to result in a positive impact, and lower interest 
rate scenarios expected to result in a negative impact, on 
the Firm’s earnings-at-risk. While a relevant measure of the 
Firm’s interest rate exposure, the earnings-at-risk analysis 
does not represent a forecast of the Firm’s net interest 
income (Refer to Outlook on page 49 for additional 
information).

Non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk 
Non-U.S. dollar FX risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates affect the value of the Firm’s assets or liabilities or 
future results. The Firm has structural non-U.S. dollar FX exposures arising from capital investments, forecasted expense and 
revenue, the investment securities portfolio and non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt issuance. Treasury and CIO, working in 
partnership with the LOBs, primarily manage these risks on behalf of the Firm. Treasury and CIO may hedge certain of these 
risks using derivatives. Refer to Business Segment Results on page 62 for additional information.
Other sensitivity-based measures
The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by assessing the 
potential impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to changes in relevant 
market variables. Refer to the predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on page 132 for additional 
information on the positions captured in other sensitivity-based measures.
The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk sensitive

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT
The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed 
to country risk resulting from financial, economic, political 
or other significant developments which adversely affect 
the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a particular 
country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management 
group actively monitors the various portfolios which may be 
impacted by these developments and measures the extent 
to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified given the 
Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.
Organization and management
Country Risk Management is an independent risk 
management function that assesses, manages and monitors 
exposure to country risk across the Firm. 
The Firm’s country risk management function includes the 
following activities:
Maintaining policies, procedures and standards 
consistent with a comprehensive country risk framework
Assigning sovereign ratings, assessing country risks and 
establishing risk tolerance relative to a country
Measuring and monitoring country risk exposure and 
stress across the Firm
Managing and approving country limits and reporting 
trends and limit breaches to senior management
Developing surveillance tools, such as signaling models 
and ratings indicators, for early identification of 
potential country risk concerns
Providing country risk scenario analysis
Sources and measurement
The Firm is exposed to country risk through its lending and 
deposits, investing, and market-making activities, whether 
cross-border or locally funded. Country exposure includes 
activity with both government and private-sector entities in 
a country. 
Under the Firm’s internal country risk management 
approach, attribution of exposure to an individual country is 
based on the country where the largest proportion of the 
assets of the counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor are 
located or where the largest proportion of its revenue is 
derived, which may be different than the domicile (i.e. legal 
residence) or country of incorporation. 
Individual country exposures reflect an aggregation of the 
Firm’s risk to an immediate default, with zero recovery, of 
the counterparties, issuers, obligors or guarantors 
attributed to that country. Activities which result in 
contingent or indirect exposure to a country are not 
included in the country exposure measure (for example, 
providing clearing services or secondary exposure to 
collateral on securities financing receivables).
Assumptions are sometimes required in determining the 
measurement and allocation of country exposure, 
particularly in the case of certain non-linear or index 
products, or where the nature of the counterparty, issuer, 
obligor or guarantor is not suitable for attribution to an 
individual country. The use of different measurement 
approaches or assumptions could affect the amount of 
reported country exposure.
Under the Firm’s internal country risk measurement 
framework:
Deposits with banks are measured as the cash balances 
placed with central banks, commercial banks, and other 
financial institutions
Lending exposures are measured at the total committed 
amount (funded and unfunded), net of the allowance for 
credit losses and eligible cash and marketable securities 
collateral received
Securities financing exposures are measured at their 
receivable balance, net of eligible collateral received
Debt and equity securities are measured at the fair value 
of all positions, including both long and short positions
Counterparty exposure on derivative receivables is 
measured at the derivative’s fair value, net of the fair 
value of the eligible collateral received
Credit derivatives exposure is measured at the net 
notional amount of protection purchased or sold for the 
same underlying reference entity, inclusive of the fair 
value of the derivative receivable or payable, reflecting 
the manner in which the Firm manages these exposures
The Firm’s internal country risk reporting differs from the 
reporting provided under the FFIEC bank regulatory 
requirements.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Stress testing
Stress testing is an important component of the Firm’s 
country risk management framework, which aims to 
estimate and limit losses arising from a country crisis by 
measuring the impact of adverse asset price movements to 
a country based on market shocks combined with 
counterparty specific assumptions. Country Risk 
Management periodically designs and runs tailored stress 
scenarios to test vulnerabilities to individual countries or 
sets of countries in response to specific or potential market 
events, sector performance concerns, sovereign actions and 
geopolitical risks. These tailored stress results are used to 
inform potential risk reduction across the Firm, as 
necessary.
Risk reporting
Country exposure and stress are measured and reported 
regularly, and used by Country Risk Management to identify 
trends and monitor high usages and breaches against limits. 
For country risk management purposes, the Firm may 
report exposure to jurisdictions that are not fully 
autonomous, including Special Administrative Regions 
(“SAR”) and dependent territories, separately from the 
independent sovereign states with which they are 
associated.
The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by 
country (excluding the U.S.) as of December 31, 2022, and 
their comparative exposures as of December 31, 2021. The 
selection of countries represents the Firm’s largest total 
exposures by individual country, based on the Firm’s 
internal country risk management approach, and does not 
represent the Firm’s view of any existing or potentially 
adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate 
from period to period due to client activity and market 
flows. 
The increase in exposure to Germany and the decrease in 
exposure to the U.K. were primarily due to changes in cash 
placements with the central banks of those countries driven 
by balance sheet and liquidity management activities.
The decrease in exposure to Australia was driven by 
reductions in cash placed with the central bank of Australia 
and government debt securities, due to client-driven 
market-making activities and lower client cash deposits 
resulting from higher interest rates. 
As of December 31, 2022, exposure to Russia was 
approximately $500 million. This amount excludes certain 
deposits placed on behalf of clients, largely at the Russian 
National Settlement Depository. In accordance with 
requirements of the Bank of Russia, these deposits were 
transferred to the Depository Insurance Agency of Russia on 
February 3, 2023.

CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT
Climate risk is the risk associated with the impacts of 
climate change on the Firm’s clients, customers, operations 
and business strategy. Climate change is viewed as a driver 
of risk that may impact existing types of risks managed by 
the Firm. Climate risk is categorized into physical risk and 
transition risk.
Physical risk refers to economic costs and financial loss 
associated with a changing climate. Acute physical risk 
drivers include the increased frequency or severity of 
climate and weather events, such as floods, wildfires and 
tropical storms. Chronic physical risk drivers include more 
gradual shifts in the climate, such as rising sea levels, 
persistent changes in precipitation levels and increases in 
average ambient temperatures.
Transition risk refers to the financial and economic 
implications associated with a societal adjustment to a lowcarbon economy. Transition risk drivers include possible 
changes in public policy, adoption of new technologies and 
shifts in consumer preferences. Transition risks may also be 
influenced by changes in the physical climate.
Organization and management
The Firm has a Climate Risk Management function that is 
responsible for establishing the Firmwide framework and 
strategy for managing climate risk. The Climate Risk 
Management function engages across the Firm to help 
integrate climate risk considerations into existing risk 
management frameworks, as appropriate.
Other responsibilities of Climate Risk Management include:
Setting policies, standards, procedures and processes to 
support identification, escalation, monitoring and 
management of climate risk across the Firm
Developing metrics, scenarios, and stress testing 
mechanisms designed to assess the range of potential 
climate-related financial and economic impacts to the 
Firm
Establishing a Firmwide climate risk data strategy and 
the supporting climate risk technology infrastructure
The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the 
identification, assessment and management of climate risks 
present in their business activities and for adherence to 
applicable climate-related laws, rules and regulations.
Governance and oversight
The Firm’s approach to managing climate risk is consistent 
with the Firm’s risk governance structure. The LOBs and 
Corporate are responsible for integrating climate risk 
management into existing governance frameworks, or 
creating new governance frameworks, as appropriate.
The LOBs, Corporate and Climate Risk Management are 
responsible for providing the Board Risk Committee with 
information on significant climate risks and climate-related 
initiatives, as appropriate.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting 
from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems; 
human factors; or external events impacting the Firm’s 
processes or systems. Operational Risk includes 
compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk. 
Operational risk is inherent in the Firm’s activities and can 
manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts, 
business disruptions (including those caused by 
extraordinary events beyond the Firm's control), cyber 
attacks, inappropriate employee behavior, failure to comply 
with applicable laws, rules and regulations or failure of 
vendors or other third party providers to perform in 
accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk 
Management attempts to manage operational risk at 
appropriate levels in light of the Firm’s financial position, 
the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and 
regulatory environments in which it operates. 
Operational Risk Management Framework
The Firm’s Compliance, Conduct, and Operational Risk 
(“CCOR”) Management Framework is designed to enable 
the Firm to govern, identify, measure, monitor and test, 
manage and report on the Firm’s operational risk. 
Operational Risk Governance
The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the 
management of operational risk. The Control Management 
Organization, which consists of control managers within 
each LOB and Corporate, is responsible for the day-to-day 
execution of the CCOR Framework. 
The Firm’s Global Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”) and FRE 
for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite is 
responsible for defining the CCOR Management Framework 
and establishing the minimum standards for its execution. 
The LOB and Corporate aligned CCOR Lead Officers report 
to the Global CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and 
Qualitative Risk Appetite and are independent of the 
respective businesses or functions they oversee. The CCOR 
Management Framework is included in the Risk Governance 
and Oversight Policy that is reviewed and approved by the 
Board Risk Committee periodically.
Operational Risk Identification
The Firm utilizes a structured risk and control selfassessment process that is executed by the LOBs and 
Corporate. As part of this process, the LOBs and Corporate 
evaluate the effectiveness of their respective control 
environment to assess where controls have failed, and to 
determine where remediation efforts may be required. The 
Firm’s Operational Risk and Compliance organization 
(“Operational Risk and Compliance”) provides oversight of 
and challenge to these evaluations and may also perform 
independent assessments of significant operational risk 
events and areas of concentrated or emerging risk.
Operational Risk Measurement
Operational Risk and Compliance performs an independent 
assessment of the operational risks inherent within the 
LOBs and Corporate, which includes evaluating the 
effectiveness of the control environments and reporting the 
results to senior management.
In addition, Operational Risk and Compliance assesses 
operational risks through quantitative means, including 
operational risk-based capital and estimation of operational 
risk losses under both baseline and stressed conditions. 
The primary component of the operational risk capital 
estimate is the Loss Distribution Approach (“LDA”) 
statistical model, which simulates the frequency and 
severity of future operational risk loss projections based on 
historical data. The LDA model is used to estimate an 
aggregate operational risk loss over a one-year time 
horizon, at a 99.9% confidence level. The LDA model 
incorporates actual internal operational risk losses in the 
quarter following the period in which those losses were 
realized, and the calculation generally continues to reflect 
such losses even after the issues or business activities 
giving rise to the losses have been remediated or reduced.
As required under the Basel III capital framework, the 
Firm’s operational risk-based capital methodology, which 
uses the Advanced Measurement Approach (“AMA”), 
incorporates internal and external losses as well as 
management’s view of tail risk captured through 
operational risk scenario analysis, and evaluation of key 
business environment and internal control metrics. The 
Firm does not reflect the impact of insurance in its AMA 
estimate of operational risk capital. 
The Firm considers the impact of stressed economic 
conditions on operational risk losses and develops a 
forward looking view of material operational risk events 
that may occur in a stressed environment. The Firm’s 
operational risk stress testing framework is utilized in 
calculating results for the Firm’s CCAR and other stress 
testing processes. 
Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for 
information related to operational risk RWA, and CCAR.
Operational Risk Monitoring and testing
The results of risk assessments performed by Operational 
Risk and Compliance are used in connection with their 
independent monitoring and testing compliance of the LOBs 
and Corporate with laws, rules and regulations. Through 
monitoring and testing, Operational Risk and Compliance 
independently identify areas of heightened operational risk 
and tests the effectiveness of controls within the LOBs and 
Corporate. 
Management’s discussion and analysis

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Management of Operational Risk
The operational risk areas or issues identified through 
monitoring and testing are escalated to the LOBs and 
Corporate to be remediated through action plans, as 
needed, to mitigate operational risk. Operational Risk and 
Compliance may advise the LOBs and Corporate in the 
development and implementation of action plans.
Operational Risk Reporting
All employees of the Firm are expected to escalate risks 
appropriately. Risks identified by Operational Risk and 
Compliance are escalated to the appropriate LOB and 
Corporate Control Committees, as needed. Operational Risk 
and Compliance has established standards designed to 
ensure that consistent operational risk reporting and 
operational risk reports are produced on a Firmwide basis 
as well as by the LOBs and Corporate. Reporting includes 
the evaluation of key risk and performance indicators 
against established thresholds as well as the assessment of 
different types of operational risk against stated risk 
appetite. The standards reinforce escalation protocols to 
senior management and to the Board of Directors.
Subcategories and examples of operational risks
Operational risk can manifest itself in various ways. 
Operational risk subcategories include Compliance risk, 
Conduct risk, Legal risk, and Estimations and Model risk. 
Refer to pages 145, 146, 147 and 148, respectively for 
more information on Compliance, Conduct, Legal, and 
Estimations and Model risk. Details on other select 
examples of operational risks such as cybersecurity, 
business and technology resiliency, payment fraud and 
third-party outsourcing are provided below.
War in Ukraine and Sanctions
In response to the war in Ukraine, numerous financial and 
economic sanctions have been imposed on Russia and 
Russia-associated entities and individuals by various 
governments around the world, including the authorities in 
the U.S., U.K. and EU. These sanctions are complex and 
continue to evolve. The Firm continues to face increased 
operational risk associated with addressing these complex 
compliance-related matters. To manage this increased risk, 
the Firm has implemented controls reasonably designed to 
mitigate the risk of non-compliance and to prevent dealing 
with sanctioned persons or in property subject to sanctions, 
as well as to block or restrict payments as required by the 
applicable regulations.
Cybersecurity risk 
Cybersecurity risk is the risk of the Firm’s exposure to harm 
or loss resulting from misuse or abuse of technology by 
malicious actors. Cybersecurity risk is an important and 
continuously evolving focus for the Firm. Significant 
resources are devoted to protecting and enhancing the 
security of computer systems, software, networks, storage 
devices, and other technology assets. The Firm’s security 
efforts are designed to protect against, among other things, 
cybersecurity attacks by unauthorized parties attempting to 
obtain access to confidential information, destroy data, 
disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other 
damage. 
The Firm has experienced, and expects that it will continue 
to experience, a higher volume and complexity of cyber 
attacks against the backdrop of heightened geopolitical 
tensions. The Firm has implemented precautionary 
measures and controls reasonably designed to address this 
increased risk, such as enhanced threat monitoring. There 
can be no assurance that the measures taken by the Firm 
will be successful in defending against cyber attacks.
Ongoing business expansions may expose the Firm to 
potential new threats as well as expanded regulatory 
scrutiny including the introduction of new cybersecurity 
requirements. The Firm continues to make significant 
investments in enhancing its cyber defense capabilities and 
to strengthen its partnerships with the appropriate 
government and law enforcement agencies and other 
businesses in order to understand the full spectrum of 
cybersecurity risks in the operating environment, enhance 
defenses and improve resiliency against cybersecurity 
threats. The Firm actively participates in discussions and 
simulations of cybersecurity risks both internally and with 
law enforcement, government officials, peer and industry 
groups, and has significantly increased efforts to educate 
employees and certain clients on the topic of cybersecurity 
risks.
Third parties with which the Firm does business or that 
facilitate the Firm’s business activities (e.g., vendors, supply 
chain, exchanges, clearing houses, central depositories, and 
financial intermediaries) are also sources of cybersecurity 
risk to the Firm. Third party cybersecurity incidents such as 
system breakdowns or failures, misconduct by the 
employees of such parties, or cyber attacks, including 
ransomware and supply-chain compromises, could affect 
their ability to deliver a product or service to the Firm or 
result in lost or compromised information of the Firm or its 
clients. Clients are also sources of cybersecurity risk to the 
Firm and its information assets, particularly when their 
activities and systems are beyond the Firm’s own security 
and control systems. As a result, the Firm engages in 
regular and ongoing discussions with certain vendors and 
clients regarding cybersecurity risks and opportunities to 
improve security. However, where cybersecurity incidents 
occur as a result of client failures to maintain the security of 
their own systems and processes, clients are responsible for 
losses incurred. 
To help safeguard the confidentiality, integrity and 
availability of the Firm’s infrastructure, resources and 
information, the Firm maintains a Information Security 
Program designed to prevent, detect, and respond to 
cyberattacks. The Board of Directors is periodically 
provided with updates on the Firm’s Information Security 
Program, recommended changes, cybersecurity policies and 
practices, ongoing efforts to improve security, as well as the 
Firm’s efforts regarding significant cybersecurity events. In 
addition, the Firm has a cybersecurity incident response 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

plan (“IRP”) designed to enable the Firm to respond to 
attempted cybersecurity incidents, coordinate such 
responses with law enforcement and other government 
agencies, and notify clients and customers, as applicable. 
Among other key focus areas, the IRP is designed to 
mitigate the risk of insider trading connected to a 
cybersecurity incident, and includes various escalation 
points. 
The Global Cybersecurity and Technology Controls 
organization, working with each of the Firm’s LOBs and 
Corporate, is responsible for identifying technology and 
cybersecurity risks and is responsible for the controls to 
manage threats. The organization consists of business 
aligned information security personnel that are supported 
within the organization by the following products and 
services that execute the Information Security Program for 
the Firm:
Cyber Operations
Identity & Access Management
Governance, Risk & Controls
Global Technology Product Security 
The Global Cybersecurity and Technology Controls 
governance structure is designed to identify, escalate, and 
mitigate information security risks. This structure uses key 
governance forums to disseminate information and monitor 
technology efforts. These forums are established at multiple 
levels throughout the Firm. The forums are used to escalate 
information security risks or other matters as appropriate. 
The IRM function provides oversight of the activities 
designed to identify, assess, measure, and mitigate 
cybersecurity risk. 
The Firm’s Security Awareness Program includes training 
that reinforces the Firm's Information Technology Risk and 
Security Management policies, standards and practices, as 
well as the expectation that employees comply with these 
policies. The Security Awareness Program engages 
personnel through training on how to identify potential 
cybersecurity risks and protect the Firm’s resources and 
information. This training is mandatory for all employees 
globally on a periodic basis, and it is supplemented by 
Firmwide testing initiatives, including periodic phishing 
tests. The Firm provides specialized security training for 
certain employee roles such as application developers. 
Finally, the Firm’s Global Privacy Program requires all 
employees to take periodic awareness training on data 
privacy. This privacy-focused training includes information 
about confidentiality and security, as well as responding to 
unauthorized access to or use of information.
Business and technology resiliency risk 
Disruptions can occur due to forces beyond the Firm’s 
control such as the spread of infectious diseases or 
pandemics, severe weather, power or telecommunications 
loss, failure of a third party to provide expected services, 
cyberattacks and terrorism. The Firmwide Business 
Resiliency Program is designed to enable the Firm to 
prepare for, adapt to, withstand and recover from business 
disruptions including occurrence of an extraordinary event 
beyond its control that may impact critical business 
functions and supporting assets (i.e., staff, technology, 
facilities and third parties). The program includes 
governance, awareness training, planning and testing of 
recovery strategies, as well as strategic and tactical 
initiatives to identify, assess, and manage business 
interruption and public safety risks.
Payment fraud risk
Payment fraud risk is the risk of external and internal 
parties unlawfully obtaining personal monetary benefit 
through misdirected or otherwise improper payment. The 
Firm employs various controls for managing payment fraud 
risk as well as providing employee and client education and 
awareness trainings.
Third-party outsourcing risk
The Firm‘s Third-Party Oversight (“TPO”) and Inter-affiliates 
Oversight (“IAO”) frameworks assist the LOBs and 
Corporate in selecting, documenting, onboarding, 
monitoring and managing their supplier relationships 
including services provided by affiliates. The objectives of 
the TPO framework are to hold suppliers and other third 
parties to a high level of operational performance and to 
mitigate key risks, including data loss and business 
disruptions. The Corporate Third-Party Oversight group 
is responsible for Firmwide training, monitoring, reporting 
and standards.
Insurance
One of the ways in which operational risk may be mitigated 
is through insurance maintained by the Firm. The Firm 
purchases insurance from commercial insurers and 
maintains a wholly-owned captive insurer, Park Assurance 
Company. Insurance may also be required by third parties 
with whom the Firm does business.

COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT
Compliance risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the 
risk of failing to comply with laws, rules, regulations or 
codes of conduct and standards of self-regulatory 
organizations. 
Overview
Each of the LOBs and Corporate hold primary ownership of 
and accountability for managing their compliance risk. The 
Firm’s Operational Risk and Compliance Organization 
(“Operational Risk and Compliance”), which is independent 
of the LOBs and Corporate, provides independent review, 
monitoring and oversight of business operations with a 
focus on compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations 
applicable to the delivery of the Firm’s products and 
services to clients and customers.
These compliance risks relate to a wide variety of laws, 
rules and regulations varying across the LOBs and 
Corporate, and jurisdictions, and include risks related to 
financial products and services, relationships and 
interactions with clients and customers, and employee 
activities. For example, compliance risks include those 
associated with anti-money laundering compliance, trading 
activities, market conduct, and complying with the laws, 
rules, and regulations related to the offering of products 
and services across jurisdictional borders. Compliance risk 
is also inherent in the Firm’s fiduciary activities, including 
the failure to exercise the applicable standard of care to act 
in the best interest of fiduciary clients and customers or to 
treat fiduciary clients and customers fairly.
Other functions provide oversight of significant regulatory 
obligations that are specific to their respective areas of 
responsibility.
Operational Risk and Compliance implements policies and 
standards designed to govern, identify, measure, monitor 
and test, manage, and report on compliance risk.
Governance and oversight
Operational Risk and Compliance is led by the Firm’s Global 
CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk 
Appetite.
The Firm maintains oversight and coordination of its 
compliance risk through the implementation of the CCOR 
Management Framework. The Firm’s Global CCO and FRE 
for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite also 
provides regular updates to the Board Risk Committee and 
the Audit Committee on significant compliance risk issues, 
as appropriate. 
Code of Conduct
The Firm has a Code of Conduct (the “Code”) that sets forth 
the Firm’s expectation that employees will conduct 
themselves with integrity at all times and provides the 
principles that govern employee conduct with clients, 
customers, shareholders and one another, as well as with 
the markets and communities in which the Firm does 
business. The Code requires employees to promptly report 
any potential or actual violation of the Code, any Firm 
policy, or any law or regulation applicable to the Firm’s 
business. It also requires employees to report any illegal 
conduct, or conduct that violates the underlying principles 
of the Code, by any of the Firm’s employees, clients, 
customers, suppliers, contract workers, business partners, 
or agents. Training is assigned to newly hired employees 
upon joining the Firm, and to current employees 
periodically on an ongoing basis. Employees are required to 
affirm their compliance with the Code annually. 
Employees can report any potential or actual violations of 
the Code through the Firm’s Conduct Hotline by phone or 
the internet. The Hotline is anonymous, except in certain 
non-U.S. jurisdictions where laws prohibit anonymous 
reporting, and is available at all times globally, with 
translation services. It is administered by an outside service 
provider. The Code prohibits retaliation against anyone who 
raises an issue or concern in good faith. Periodically, the 
Audit Committee receives reports on the Code of Conduct 
program.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

CONDUCT RISK MANAGEMENT
Conduct risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk 
that any action or misconduct by an employee could lead to 
unfair client or customer outcomes, impact the integrity of 
the markets in which the Firm operates, harm employees or 
the Firm, or compromise the Firm’s reputation.
Overview
Each LOB and Corporate is accountable for identifying and 
managing its conduct risk to provide appropriate 
engagement, ownership and sustainability of a culture 
consistent with the Firm’s How We Do Business Principles 
(the “Principles”). The Principles serve as a guide for how 
employees are expected to conduct themselves. With the 
Principles serving as a guide, the Firm’s Code sets out the 
Firm’s expectations for each employee and provides 
information and resources to help employees conduct 
business ethically and in compliance with applicable laws, 
rules and regulations everywhere the Firm operates. Refer 
to Compliance Risk Management on page 145 for further 
discussion of the Code.
Governance and oversight
The Conduct Risk Program is governed by the CCOR 
Management policy, which establishes the framework for 
governance, identification, measurement, monitoring and 
testing, management and reporting conduct risk in the 
Firm.
The Firm has a senior forum that provides oversight of the 
Firm’s conduct initiatives to develop a more holistic view of 
conduct risks and to connect key programs across the Firm 
in order to identify opportunities and emerging areas of 
focus. This forum is responsible for setting overall program 
direction for strategic enhancements to the Firm's 
employee conduct framework and reviewing the 
consolidated Firmwide Conduct Risk Appetite Assessment.
Conduct risk management encompasses various aspects of 
people management practices throughout the employee life 
cycle, including recruiting, onboarding, training and 
development, performance management, promotion and 
compensation processes. Each LOB, Treasury and CIO, and 
each designated corporate function completes an 
assessment of conduct risk periodically, reviews metrics 
and issues which may involve conduct risk, and provides 
conduct education as appropriate.

LEGAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Legal risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk of 
loss primarily caused by the actual or alleged failure to 
meet legal obligations that arise from the rule of law in 
jurisdictions in which the Firm operates, agreements with 
clients and customers, and products and services offered by 
the Firm. 
Overview
The global Legal function (“Legal”) provides legal services 
and advice to the Firm. Legal is responsible for managing 
the Firm’s exposure to legal risk by:
managing actual and potential litigation and 
enforcement matters, including internal reviews and 
investigations related to such matters
advising on products and services, including contract 
negotiation and documentation
advising on offering and marketing documents and new 
business initiatives
managing dispute resolution
interpreting existing laws, rules and regulations, and 
advising on changes to them
advising on advocacy in connection with contemplated 
and proposed laws, rules and regulations, and 
providing legal advice to the LOBs, Corporate and the 
Board. 
Legal selects, engages and manages outside counsel for the 
Firm on all matters in which outside counsel is engaged. In 
addition, Legal advises the Firm’s Conflicts Office which 
reviews the Firm’s wholesale transactions that may have 
the potential to create conflicts of interest for the Firm. 
Governance and oversight
The Firm’s General Counsel reports to the CEO and is a 
member of the Operating Committee, the Firmwide Risk 
Committee and the Firmwide Control Committee. The Firm’s 
General Counsel and other members of Legal report on 
significant legal matters to the Firm’s Board of Directors 
and to the Audit Committee. 
Legal serves on and advises various committees and advises 
the Firm’s LOBs and Corporate on potential reputation risk 
issues.

ESTIMATIONS AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT
Estimations and Model risk, a subcategory of operational 
risk, is the potential for adverse consequences from 
decisions based on incorrect or misused estimation outputs. 
The Firm uses models and other analytical and judgmentbased estimations across various businesses and functions. 
The estimation methods are of varying levels of 
sophistication and are used for many purposes, such as the 
valuation of positions and measurement of risk, assessing 
regulatory capital requirements, conducting stress testing, 
evaluating the allowance for credit losses and making 
business decisions. A dedicated independent function, 
Model Risk Governance and Review (“MRGR”), defines and 
governs the Firm’s policies relating to the management of 
model risk and risks associated with certain analytical and 
judgment-based estimations, such as those used in risk 
management, budget forecasting and capital planning and 
analysis. 
The governance of analytical and judgment-based 
estimations within MRGR’s scope follows a consistent 
approach which is used for models, as described in detail 
below. 
Model risks are owned by the users of the models within the 
Firm based on the specific purposes of such models. Users 
and developers of models are responsible for developing, 
implementing and testing their models, as well as referring 
models to MRGR for review and approval. Once models have 
been approved, model users and developers are responsible 
for maintaining a robust operating environment, and must 
monitor and evaluate the performance of the models on an 
ongoing basis. Model users and developers may seek to 
enhance models in response to changes in the portfolios 
and in product and market developments, as well as to 
capture improvements in available modeling techniques 
and systems capabilities. 
Models are tiered based on an internal standard according 
to their complexity, the exposure associated with the model 
and the Firm’s reliance on the model. This tiering is subject 
to the approval of MRGR. In its review of a model, MRGR 
considers whether the model is suitable for the specific 
purposes for which it will be used. When reviewing a model, 
MRGR analyzes and challenges the model methodology and 
the reasonableness of model assumptions, and may 
perform or require additional testing, including back-testing 
of model outcomes. Model reviews are approved by the 
appropriate level of management within MRGR based on the 
relevant model tier.
Under the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk Management 
Policy, MRGR reviews and approves new models, as well as 
material changes to existing models, prior to their use. In 
certain circumstances, exceptions may be granted to the 
Firm’s policy to allow a model to be used prior to review or 
approval. MRGR may also require the user to take 
appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be 
used in the interim. These actions will depend on the model 
and may include, for example, limitation of trading activity.
While models are inherently imprecise, the degree of 
imprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the market 
or economic environment. This is particularly true when the 
current and forecasted environments are significantly 
different from the historical environments upon which the 
models were developed, as the Firm experienced during the 
early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. This increased 
uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of judgment 
and analytics to inform any adjustments that the Firm may 
make to model outputs than would otherwise be the case. 
Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on 
pages 149-152 and Note 2 for a summary of model-based 
valuations and other valuation techniques.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM 
JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of estimates 
are integral to understanding its reported results. The 
Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require 
management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate 
carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has 
established policies and control procedures intended to 
ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments 
made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, 
independently reviewed and applied consistently from 
period to period. The methods used and judgments made 
reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or 
liabilities and the related business and risk management 
strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and 
portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are 
intended to ensure that the process for changing 
methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm 
believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of 
its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a 
brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates 
involving significant judgments.
Allowance for credit losses
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents 
management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the 
remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial assets 
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet 
lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit 
losses comprises:
• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s 
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),
• The allowance for lending-related commitments, and
• The allowance for credit losses on investment securities.
The allowance for credit losses involves significant 
judgment on a number of matters including development 
and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of 
historical loss experience, assessment of risk 
characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of 
collateral, and the determination of remaining expected 
life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for further information 
on these judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and 
methodologies used to determine the Firm’s allowance for 
credit losses.
One of the most significant judgments involved in 
estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to 
the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses 
over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm’s 
methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates 
hundreds of macroeconomic variables (“MEVs”) that are 
relevant for exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit 
losses being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty 
variables. The specific variables that have the greatest 
effect on the modeled losses of each portfolio vary by 
portfolio and geography.
• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include regional U.S. 
unemployment rates, HPI and U.S. real GDP.
• Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. real 
GDP, U.S. unemployment, U.S. equity prices, U.S. interest 
rates, corporate credit spreads, oil prices, commercial 
real estate prices and HPI.
Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of 
economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of 
expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet 
date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one 
reporting period to the next.
It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one 
factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit 
losses because management considers a wide variety of 
factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit 
losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may 
not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across 
all geographies or product types, and changes in factors 
and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that 
improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration 
in others.
To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate 
macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled 
credit losses determined using its central and relative 
adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five 
scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan 
losses and lending-related commitments. The central and 
relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of 
MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of 
those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period. 
For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario 
shown on page 127 and in Note 13, the Firm’s relative 
adverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. unemployment 
rate, averaging approximately 1.9% higher over the eightquarter forecast, with a peak difference of approximately 
2.8% in the fourth quarter of 2023; lower U.S. real GDP 
with a slower recovery, remaining nearly 3.1% lower at the 
end of the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of 
approximately 3.9% in the fourth quarter of 2023; and 
lower national HPI with a peak difference of approximately 
8.4% in the third quarter of 2024.
This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future 
changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of 
reasons, including:
• The allowance as of December 31, 2022, reflects credit 
losses beyond those estimated under the central scenario 
due to the weight placed on the adverse scenarios.
• The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both 
interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this analysis 
cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes 
in macroeconomic variables. 
• Expectations of future changes in portfolio composition 
and borrower behavior can significantly affect the 
allowance for credit losses.
To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to 
macroeconomic forecasts as of December 31, 2022, the 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Firm compared the modeled estimates under its relative 
adverse scenario to its central scenario. Without 
considering offsetting or correlated effects in other 
qualitative components of the Firm’s allowance for credit 
losses, the comparison between these two scenarios for the 
exposures below reflect the following differences:
• An increase of approximately $500 million for residential 
real estate loans and lending-related commitments
• An increase of approximately $2.2 billion for credit card 
loans
• An increase of approximately $3.9 billion for wholesale 
loans and lending-related commitments
This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss 
estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the 
overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any 
potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative 
calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment 
management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates 
to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled 
lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances 
and conditions.
Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are 
inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the recent 
economic conditions, the Firm believes that its process to 
consider the available information and associated risks and 
uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its 
estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and 
appropriate for the period ended December 31, 2022.
Fair value
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities 
at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are 
measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including 
derivatives, structured note products and certain securities 
financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities are 
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including 
certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the 
carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying 
collateral.
Assets measured at fair value 
The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at 
fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified 
within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for

Management’s discussion and analysis

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Valuation
Details of the Firm’s processes for determining fair value 
are set out in Note 2. Estimating fair value requires the 
application of judgment. The type and level of judgment 
required is largely dependent on the amount of observable 
market information available to the Firm. For instruments 
valued using internally developed valuation models and 
other valuation techniques that use significant 
unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within 
level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to 
estimate fair value are more significant than those required 
when estimating the fair value of instruments classified 
within levels 1 and 2.
In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument 
within level 3, management must first determine the 
appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to 
use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant 
inputs requires management to assess relevant empirical 
data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, 
transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment 
speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such 
as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of 
comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit 
curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the 
valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable 
inputs used.
For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management 
judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of 
valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, 
the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity 
considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios 
that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk 
position. The judgments made are typically affected by the 
type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the 
level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a 
whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and 
uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider 
variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for 
positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further 
discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm.
Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or 
other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded 
for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm 
believes its valuation methods are appropriate and 
consistent with those of other market participants, the 
methods and assumptions used reflect management 
judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and 
portfolios.
The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in 
the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or 
assumptions different than those used by the Firm could 
result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting 
date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s 
valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of 
fair value for individual financial instruments.
Goodwill impairment 
Under U.S. GAAP, goodwill must be allocated to reporting 
units and tested for impairment at least annually. The 
Firm’s process and methodology used to conduct goodwill 
impairment testing is described in Note 15.
Management applies significant judgment when testing 
goodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with each 
business combination is allocated to the related reporting 
units for goodwill impairment testing.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Firm reviewed 
current economic conditions, estimated market cost of 
equity, as well as actual business results and projections of 
business performance. Based on such reviews, the Firm has 
concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of 
December 31, 2022. For each of the reporting units, fair 
value exceeded carrying value by at least 10% and there 
was no indication of a significant risk of goodwill 
impairment based on current projections and valuations. 
The projections for the Firm’s reporting units are consistent 
with management’s current business outlook assumptions 
in the short term, and the Firm’s best estimates of longterm growth and return on equity in the longer term. Where 
possible, the Firm uses third-party and peer data to 
benchmark its assumptions and estimates.
Refer to Note 15 for additional information on goodwill, 
including the goodwill impairment assessment as of 
December 31, 2022.
Credit card rewards liability
JPMorgan Chase offers credit cards with various rewards 
programs which allow cardholders to earn rewards points 
based on their account activity and the terms and 
conditions of the rewards program. Generally, there are no 
limits on the points that an eligible cardholder can earn, nor 
do the points expire, and the points can be redeemed for a 
variety of rewards, including cash (predominantly in the 
form of account credits), gift cards and travel. The Firm 
maintains a rewards liability which represents the 
estimated cost of rewards points earned and expected to be 
redeemed by cardholders. The liability is accrued as the 
cardholder earns the benefit and is reduced when the 
cardholder redeems points. This liability was $11.3 billion 
and $9.8 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, 
respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other 
liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. The increase 
in the liability was driven by continued growth in rewards 
points earned on increased cardholder spending and 
promotional offers outpacing redemptions throughout 
2022.
The rewards liability is sensitive to redemption rate (“RR”) 
and cost per point (“CPP”) assumptions. The RR assumption 
is used to estimate the number of points earned by 
customers that will be redeemed over the life of the 
account. The CPP assumption is used to estimate the cost of 
future point redemptions. These assumptions are evaluated 
periodically considering historical actuals, cardholder 
redemption behavior and management judgment. Updates 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

to these assumptions will impact the rewards liability. As of 
December 31, 2022, a combined increase of 25 basis 
points in RR and 1 basis point in CPP would increase the 
rewards liability by approximately $315 million.
Income taxes 

various jurisdictions in which it operates, including U.S. 
federal, state and local, and non-U.S. jurisdictions. These 
laws are often complex and may be subject to different 
interpretations. To determine the financial statement 
impact of accounting for income taxes, including the 
provision for income tax expense and unrecognized tax 
benefits, JPMorgan Chase must make assumptions and 
judgments about how to interpret and apply these complex 
tax laws to numerous transactions and business events, as 
well as make judgments regarding the timing of when 
certain items may affect taxable income in the U.S. and 
non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.
JPMorgan Chase’s interpretations of tax laws around the 
world are subject to review and examination by the various 
taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where the Firm 
operates, and disputes may occur regarding its view on a 
tax position. These disputes over interpretations with the 
various taxing authorities may be settled by audit, 
administrative appeals or adjudication in the court systems 
of the tax jurisdictions in which the Firm operates. 
JPMorgan Chase regularly reviews whether it may be 
assessed additional income taxes as a result of the 
resolution of these matters, and the Firm records additional 
unrecognized tax benefits, as appropriate. In addition, the 
Firm may revise its estimate of income taxes due to changes 
in income tax laws, legal interpretations, and business 
strategies. It is possible that revisions in the Firm’s estimate 
of income taxes may materially affect the Firm’s results of 
operations in any reporting period.
Deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and 
liabilities measured for financial reporting versus income 
tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, 
in management’s judgment, their realizability is determined 
to be more likely than not. Deferred taxes are measured 
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income 
in the years in which those temporary differences are 
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred 
taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized within the 
provision for income taxes in the period enacted.
The Firm has also recognized deferred tax assets in 
connection with certain tax attributes, including net 
operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and foreign tax credit 
(“FTC”) carryforwards. The Firm performs regular reviews 
to ascertain whether its deferred tax assets are realizable. 
These reviews include management’s estimates and 
assumptions regarding future taxable income, including 
foreign source income, and may incorporate various tax 
planning strategies, including strategies that may be 
available to utilize NOLs and FTCs before they expire. In 
connection with these reviews, if it is determined that a 
deferred tax asset is not realizable, a valuation allowance is 
established. The valuation allowance may be reversed in a 
subsequent reporting period if the Firm determines that, 
based on revised estimates of future taxable income or 
changes in tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not 
that all or part of the deferred tax asset will become 
realizable. As of December 31, 2022, management has 
determined it is more likely than not that the Firm will 
realize its deferred tax assets, net of the existing valuation 
allowance.
The Firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as necessary 
when new information becomes available, including 
changes in tax law and regulations, and interactions with 
taxing authorities. Uncertain tax positions that meet the 
more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured to 
determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain 
tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit 
that management believes is more likely than not to be 
realized upon settlement. It is possible that the 
reassessment of JPMorgan Chase’s unrecognized tax 
benefits may have a material impact on its effective income 
tax rate in the period in which the reassessment occurs. 
Although the Firm believes that its estimates are 
reasonable, the final tax amount could be different from the 
amounts reflected in the Firm’s income tax provisions and 
accruals. To the extent that the final outcome of these 
amounts is different than the amounts recorded, such 
differences will generally impact the Firm’s provision for 
income taxes in the period in which such a determination is 
made.
The Firm’s provision for income taxes is composed of 
current and deferred taxes. The current and deferred tax 
provisions are calculated based on estimates and 
assumptions that could differ from the actual results 
reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent 
year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally 
recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and 
the global tax implications are known, which could impact 
the Firm’s effective tax rate.

taxes.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
From time to time, the Firm has made and will make 
forward-looking statements. These statements can be 
identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to 
historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often 
use words such as “anticipate,” “target,” “expect,” 
“estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “believe,” or other 
words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements 
provide JPMorgan Chase’s current expectations or forecasts 
of future events, circumstances, results or aspirations. 
JPMorgan Chase’s disclosures in this 2022 Form 10-K

Firm also may make forward-looking statements in its other 
documents filed or furnished with the SEC. In addition, the 
Firm’s senior management may make forward-looking 
statements orally to investors, analysts, representatives of 
the media and others.
All forward-looking statements are, by their nature, subject 
to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the 
Firm’s control. JPMorgan Chase’s actual future results may 
differ materially from those set forth in its forward-looking 
statements. While there is no assurance that any list of risks 
and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, below are 
certain factors which could cause actual results to differ 
from those in the forward-looking statements:
Local, regional and global business, economic and 
political conditions and geopolitical events, including the 
war in Ukraine;

Management’s discussion and analysis

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Management of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” 
or the “Firm”) is responsible for establishing and 
maintaining adequate internal control over financial 
reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a 
process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Firm’s 
principal executive and principal financial officers, or 
persons performing similar functions, and effected by 
JPMorgan Chase’s Board of Directors, management and 
other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding 
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of 
financial statements for external purposes in accordance 
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to 
the maintenance of records, that, in reasonable detail, 
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of the Firm’s assets; (2) provide reasonable 
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to 
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the 
Firm are being made only in accordance with authorizations 
of JPMorgan Chase’s management and directors; and (3) 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or 
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or 
disposition of the Firm’s assets that could have a material 
effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over 
financial reporting may not prevent or detect 
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of 
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that 
controls may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the 
policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management has 
completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Firm’s 
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 
2022. In making the assessment, management used the 
“Internal Control — Integrated Framework” (“COSO 2013”) 
promulgated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations 
of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”).
Based upon the assessment performed, management 
concluded that as of December 31, 2022, JPMorgan 
Chase’s internal control over financial reporting was 
effective based upon the COSO 2013 framework. 
Additionally, based upon management’s assessment, the 
Firm determined that there were no material weaknesses in 
its internal control over financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2022.
The effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over 
financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, has been 
audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent 
registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report 
which appears herein.

Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of JPMorgan 
Chase & Co.:
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control 
over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance 
sheets of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries (the 
“Firm”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related 
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, 
changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of 
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, 
including the related notes (collectively referred to as the 
“consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited 
the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements 
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the 
financial position of the Firm as of December 31, 2022 and 
2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for 
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 
2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America. Also in our 
opinion, the Firm maintained, in all material respects, 
effective internal control over financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the 
COSO. 
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial 
statements, the Firm changed the manner in which it 
accounts for credit losses on certain financial instruments in 
2020. 
Basis for Opinions
The Firm’s management is responsible for these 
consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective 
internal control over financial reporting, and for its 
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over 
financial reporting, included in the accompanying 
Management’s report on internal control over financial 
reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the 
Firm’s consolidated financial statements and on the Firm’s 
internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. 
We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) 
(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to 
the Firm in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws 
and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities 
and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of 
the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the consolidated financial statements are free of 
material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and 
whether effective internal control over financial reporting 
was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included 
performing procedures to assess the risks of material 
misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, 
whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures 
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included 
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts 
and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our 
audits also included evaluating the accounting principles 
used and significant estimates made by management, as 
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the 
consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal 
control over financial reporting included obtaining an 
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and 
testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. 
Our audits also included performing such other procedures 
as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe 
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial 
Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a 
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding 
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of 
financial statements for external purposes in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s 
internal control over financial reporting includes those 
policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance 
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the 
company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts 
and expenditures of the company are being made only in 
accordance with authorizations of management and 
directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable 
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of 
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the 
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the 
financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over 
financial reporting may not prevent or detect 
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of 
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that 
controls may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the 
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters 
arising from the current period audit of the consolidated 
financial statements that were communicated or required 
to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) 
relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the 
consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our 
especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. 
The communication of critical audit matters does not alter 
in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by 
communicating the critical audit matters below, providing 
separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the 
accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Allowance for Loan Losses – Portfolio-based component of 
Wholesale Loan and Credit Card Loan Portfolios 
As described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial 
statements, the allowance for loan losses for the portfoliobased component of the wholesale and credit card loan 
portfolios was $17.0 billion on total portfolio-based 
retained loans of $785.9 billion at December 31, 2022. The 
Firm’s allowance for loan losses represents management’s 
estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining 
expected life of the Firm's loan portfolios and considers 
expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. The 
portfolio-based component of the Firm’s allowance for loan 
losses for the wholesale and credit card retained loan 
portfolios begins with a quantitative calculation of expected 
credit losses over the expected life of the loan by applying 
credit loss factors to the estimated exposure at default. The 
credit loss factors applied are determined based on the 
weighted average of five internally developed 
macroeconomic scenarios that take into consideration the 
Firm's economic outlook as derived through forecast 
macroeconomic variables, the most significant of which are 
U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product. 
This quantitative calculation is further adjusted to take into 
consideration model imprecision, emerging risk 
assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are 
not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate.
The principal considerations for our determination that 
performing procedures relating to the allowance for loan 
losses for the portfolio-based component of the wholesale 
and credit card loan portfolios is a critical audit matter are 
(i) the significant judgment and estimation by management 
in the forecast of macroeconomic variables, specifically U.S. 
unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product, as the 
Firm’s forecasts of economic conditions significantly affect 
its estimate of expected credit losses at the balance sheet 
date, (ii) the significant judgment and estimation by 
management in determining the quantitative calculation 
utilized in their credit loss estimates and the adjustments to 
take into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk 
assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are 
not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate, 
which both in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, 
subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and in 
evaluating audit evidence obtained relating to the credit 
loss estimates and the appropriateness of the adjustments 
to the credit loss estimates, and (iii) the audit effort 
involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and 
knowledge.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and 
evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our 
overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. 
These procedures included testing the effectiveness of 
controls relating to the Firm’s allowance for loan losses, 
including controls over model validation and generation of 
macroeconomic scenarios. These procedures also included, 
among others, testing management’s process for estimating 
the allowance for loan losses, which involved (i) evaluating 
the appropriateness of the models and methodologies used 
in quantitative calculations; (ii) evaluating the 
reasonableness of forecasts of U.S. unemployment and U.S. 
real gross domestic product; (iii) testing the completeness 
and accuracy of data used in the estimate; and (iv) 
evaluating the reasonableness of management’s 
adjustments to the quantitative output for the impacts of 
model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and 
other subjective factors that are not yet otherwise reflected 
in the credit loss estimate. These procedures also included 
the use of professionals with specialized skill and 
knowledge to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of 
certain models, methodologies and macroeconomic 
variables.
Fair Value of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments
As described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial 
statements, the Firm carries $1.1 trillion of its assets and 
$453.7 billion of its liabilities at fair value on a recurring 
basis. Included in these balances are $13.6 billion of 
trading assets and $37.8 billion of liabilities measured at 
fair value on a recurring basis, collectively financial 
instruments, which are classified as level 3 as they contain 
one or more inputs to valuation which are unobservable 
and significant to their fair value measurement. The Firm 
utilized internally developed valuation models and 
unobservable inputs to estimate fair value of the level 3 
financial instruments. The unobservable inputs used by 
management to estimate the fair value of certain of these 
financial instruments include volatility relating to interest 
rates, correlation relating to interest rates, equity prices, 
credit and foreign exchange rates, and Bermudan switch 
values.
The principal considerations for our determination that 
performing procedures relating to the fair value of certain 
level 3 financial instruments is a critical audit matter are (i) 
the significant judgment and estimation by management in 
determining the inputs to estimate fair value, which in turn 
led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and 
effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit 
evidence obtained related to the fair value of these financial 
instruments, and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of 
professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and 
evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our 
overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. 
These procedures included testing the effectiveness of 
controls relating to the Firm’s determination of the fair 
value, including controls over models, inputs, and data. 
These procedures also included, among others, the 
involvement of professionals with specialized skill and 
knowledge to assist in developing an independent estimate 
of fair value for a sample of these financial instruments and 
comparing management’s estimate to the independently 
developed estimate of fair value. Developing the 
independent estimate involved testing the completeness 
and accuracy of data provided by management, developing 
independent inputs and, as appropriate, evaluating and 
utilizing management’s aforementioned unobservable 
inputs.

JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Consolidated statements of cash flows
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Note 1 – Basis of presentation
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a 
financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law 
in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the 
U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in 
investment banking, financial services for consumers and 
small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction 
processing and asset management. Refer to Note 32 for a 
further discussion of the Firm’s business segments.
The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan 
Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. 
Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the 
accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by 
regulatory authorities.
Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been 
revised to conform with the current presentation. 
Consolidation 
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts 
of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has 
a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany 
balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by 
the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not 
included on the Consolidated balance sheets.
The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial 
interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is 
a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity. 
Voting interest entities
Voting interest entities are entities that have sufficient 
equity and provide the equity investors voting rights that 
enable them to make significant decisions relating to the 
entity’s operations. For these types of entities, the Firm’s 
determination of whether it has a controlling interest is 
primarily based on the amount of voting equity interests 
held. Entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial 
interest, through ownership of the majority of the entities’ 
voting equity interests, or through other contractual rights 
that give the Firm control, are consolidated by the Firm.
Investments in companies in which the Firm has significant 
influence over operating and financing decisions (but does 
not own a majority of the voting equity interests) are 
accounted for (i) in accordance with the equity method of 
accounting, or (ii) at fair value if the fair value option was 
elected. These investments are generally included in other 
assets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue.
Certain Firm-sponsored asset management funds are 
structured as limited partnerships or limited liability 
companies. For many of these entities, the Firm is the 
general partner or managing member, but the nonaffiliated partners or members have the ability to remove 
the Firm as the general partner or managing member 
without cause (i.e., kick-out rights), based on a simple 
majority vote, or the non-affiliated partners or members 
have rights to participate in important decisions. 
Accordingly, the Firm does not consolidate these voting 
interest entities. However, in the limited cases where the 
non-managing partners or members do not have 
substantive kick-out or participating rights, the Firm 
evaluates the funds as VIEs and consolidates the funds if 
the Firm is the general partner or managing member and 
has both power and a potentially significant interest. 
The Firm’s investment companies and asset management 
funds have investments in both publicly-held and privatelyheld entities, including investments in buyouts, growth 
equity and venture opportunities. These investments are 
accounted for under investment company guidelines and, 
accordingly, irrespective of the percentage of equity 
ownership interests held, are carried on the Consolidated 
balance sheets at fair value, and are recorded in other 
assets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue. 
If consolidated, the Firm retains the accounting under such 
specialized investment company guidelines.
Variable interest entities 
VIEs are entities that, by design, either (1) lack sufficient 
equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without 
additional subordinated financial support from other 
parties, or (2) have equity investors that do not have the 
ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s 
operations through voting rights, or do not have the 
obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have the 
right to receive the residual returns of the entity.
The most common type of VIE is an SPE. SPEs are commonly 
used in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain 
assets and distribute the cash flows from those assets to 
investors. The basic SPE structure involves a company 
selling assets to the SPE; the SPE funds the purchase of 
those assets by issuing securities to investors. The legal 
documents that govern the transaction specify how the cash 
earned on the assets must be allocated to the SPE’s 
investors and other parties that have rights to those cash 
flows. SPEs are generally structured to insulate investors 
from claims on the SPE’s assets by creditors of other 
entities, including the creditors of the seller of the assets. 
The primary beneficiary of a VIE (i.e., the party that has a 
controlling financial interest) is required to consolidate the 
assets and liabilities of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is 
the party that has both (1) the power to direct the activities 
of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic 
performance; and (2) through its interests in the VIE, the 
obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits 
from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
To assess whether the Firm has the power to direct the 
activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s 
economic performance, the Firm considers all the facts and 
circumstances, including its role in establishing the VIE and 
its ongoing rights and responsibilities. This assessment 
Notes to consolidated financial statements

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

includes, first, identifying the activities that most 
significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and 
second, identifying which party, if any, has power over 
those activities. In general, the parties that make the most 
significant decisions affecting the VIE (such as asset 
managers, collateral managers, servicers, or owners of call 
options or liquidation rights over the VIE’s assets) or have 
the right to unilaterally remove those decision-makers are 
deemed to have the power to direct the activities of a VIE.
To assess whether the Firm has the obligation to absorb 
losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the 
VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, the Firm 
considers all of its economic interests, including debt and 
equity investments, servicing fees, and derivatives or other 
arrangements deemed to be variable interests in the VIE. 
This assessment requires that the Firm apply judgment in 
determining whether these interests, in the aggregate, are 
considered potentially significant to the VIE. Factors 
considered in assessing significance include: the design of 
the VIE, including its capitalization structure; subordination 
of interests; payment priority; relative share of interests 
held across various classes within the VIE’s capital 
structure; and the reasons why the interests are held by the 
Firm.
The Firm performs on-going reassessments of: (1) whether 
entities previously evaluated under the majority votinginterest framework have become VIEs, based on certain 
events, and are therefore subject to the VIE consolidation 
framework; and (2) whether changes in the facts and 
circumstances regarding the Firm’s involvement with a VIE 
cause the Firm’s consolidation conclusion to change.
Refer to Note 14 for further discussion of the Firm’s VIEs.
Revenue recognition 
Interest income 
The Firm recognizes interest income on loans, debt 
securities, and other debt instruments, generally on a levelyield basis, based on the underlying contractual rate. Refer 
to Note 7 for further information.
Revenue from contracts with customers 
JPMorgan Chase recognizes noninterest revenue from 
certain contracts with customers, in investment banking 
fees, deposit-related fees, asset management 
administration and commissions, and components of card 
income, when the Firm’s related performance obligations 
are satisfied. Refer to Note 6 for further discussion of the 
Firm’s revenue from contracts with customers. 
Principal transactions revenue 
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities 
at fair value. Changes in fair value are reported primarily in 
principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for 
further discussion of fair value measurement. Refer to Note 
6 for further discussion of principal transactions revenue. 
Use of estimates in the preparation of consolidated 
financial statements
The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
revenue and expense, and disclosures of contingent assets 
and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these 
estimates.
Foreign currency translation
JPMorgan Chase revalues assets, liabilities, revenue and 
expense denominated in non-U.S. currencies into U.S. 
dollars using applicable exchange rates.
Gains and losses relating to translating functional currency 
financial statements for U.S. reporting are included in the 
Consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Gains 
and losses relating to nonfunctional currency transactions, 
including non-U.S. operations where the functional currency 
is the U.S. dollar, are reported in the Consolidated 
statements of income.
Offsetting assets and liabilities
U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables 
and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the 
related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net 
basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally 
enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP 
also permits securities sold and purchased under 
repurchase agreements and securities borrowed or loaned 
under securities loan agreements to be presented net when 
specified conditions are met, including the existence of a 
legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has 
elected to net such balances where it has determined that 
the specified conditions are met.
The Firm uses master netting agreements to mitigate 
counterparty credit risk in certain transactions, including 
derivative contracts, resale, repurchase, securities 
borrowed and securities loaned agreements. A master 
netting agreement is a single agreement with a 
counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed 
by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and 
settled through a single payment in a single currency in the 
event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a 
required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral 
or margin when due). Upon the exercise of derivatives 
termination rights by the non-defaulting party (i) all 
transactions are terminated, (ii) all transactions are valued 
and the positive values of “in the money” transactions are 
netted against the negative values of “out of the money” 
transactions and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation 
is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination 
amount. Upon exercise of default rights under repurchase 
agreements and securities loan agreements in general (i) 
all transactions are terminated and accelerated, (ii) all 
values of securities or cash held or to be delivered are 
calculated, and all such sums are netted against each other 
and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of 
the parties to pay the netted termination amount.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Typical master netting agreements for these types of 
transactions also often contain a collateral/margin 
agreement that provides for a security interest in, or title 
transfer of, securities or cash collateral/margin to the party 
that has the right to demand margin (the “demanding 
party”). The collateral/margin agreement typically requires 
a party to transfer collateral/margin to the demanding 
party with a value equal to the amount of the margin deficit 
on a net basis across all transactions governed by the 
master netting agreement, less any threshold. The 
collateral/margin agreement grants to the demanding 
party, upon default by the counterparty, the right to set-off 
any amounts payable by the counterparty against any 
posted collateral or the cash equivalent of any posted 
collateral/margin. It also grants to the demanding party the 
right to liquidate collateral/margin and to apply the 
proceeds to an amount payable by the counterparty.
Refer to Note 5 for further discussion of the Firm’s 
derivative instruments. Refer to Note 11 for further 
discussion of the Firm’s securities financing agreements.
Statements of cash flows
For JPMorgan Chase’s Consolidated statements of cash 
flows, cash is defined as those amounts included in cash 
and due from banks and deposits with banks on the 
Consolidated balance sheets.
Accounting standard adopted January 1, 2023
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses: Troubled Debt 
Restructurings (“TDRs”) 
The adoption of this guidance eliminates the accounting and 
disclosure requirements for TDRs, including the 
requirement to measure the allowance using a discounted 
cash flow (“DCF”) methodology, and allows the option of a 
non-DCF portfolio-based approach for modified loans to 
troubled borrowers. If a DCF methodology is still applied for 
these modified loans, the discount rate must be the postmodification effective interest rate, instead of the premodification effective interest rate. 
The Firm elected to apply its non-DCF, portfolio-based 
allowance approach for modified loans to troubled 
borrowers for all portfolios except modified nonaccrual 
risk-rated loans which the Firm elected to continue applying 
a DCF methodology. See Note 13 for a description of the 
portfolio-based allowance approach and the asset-specific 
allowance approach.
This guidance was adopted on January 1, 2023 under the 
modified retrospective method which resulted in a net 
decrease to the allowance for credit losses of approximately 
$600 million and an increase to retained earnings of 
approximately $450 million, after-tax predominantly driven 
by residential real estate and credit card.
Accounting standard adopted January 1, 2020
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (“CECL”)
The adoption of this guidance established a single 
allowance framework for all financial assets measured at 
amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet credit 
exposures. This framework requires that management’s 
estimate reflects credit losses over the instrument’s 
remaining expected life and considers expected future 
changes in macroeconomic conditions. Prior to the adoption 
of the CECL accounting guidance, the Firm’s allowance for 
credit losses represented management’s estimate of 
probable credit losses inherent in the Firm’s retained loan 
portfolios and certain lending-related commitments.

Note 2 – Fair value measurement
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities 
at fair value. These assets and liabilities are predominantly 
carried at fair value on a recurring basis (i.e., assets and 
liabilities that are measured and reported at fair value on 
the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets). Certain assets, 
liabilities and unfunded lending-related commitments are 
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, they 
are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are 
subject to fair value adjustments only in certain 
circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of 
impairment).
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to 
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date. Fair value is based on quoted market 
prices or inputs, where available. If prices or quotes are not 
available, fair value is based on valuation models and other 
valuation techniques that consider relevant transaction 
characteristics (such as maturity) and use, as inputs, 
observable or unobservable market parameters, including 
yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, prices (such as 
commodity, equity or debt prices), correlations, foreign 
exchange rates and credit curves. Valuation adjustments 
may be made to ensure that financial instruments are 
recorded at fair value, as described below. 
The level of precision in estimating unobservable market 
inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss 
recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the 
Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and 
consistent with those of other market participants, the 
methods and assumptions used reflect management 
judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and 
portfolios. 
The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in 
the determination of fair value. The use of different 
methodologies or assumptions by other market participants 
compared with those used by the Firm could result in the 
Firm deriving a different estimate of fair value at the 
reporting date. 
Valuation process 
Risk-taking functions are responsible for providing fair 
value estimates for assets and liabilities carried on the 
Consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The Firm’s 
Valuation Control Group (“VCG”), which is part of the Firm’s 
Finance function and independent of the risk-taking 
functions, is responsible for verifying these estimates and 
determining any fair value adjustments that may be 
required to ensure that the Firm’s positions are recorded at 
fair value. In addition, the Firm’s Valuation Governance 
Forum (“VGF”), which is composed of senior finance and 
risk executives, is responsible for overseeing the 
management of risks arising from valuation activities 
conducted across the Firm. The Firmwide VGF is chaired by 
the Firmwide head of the VCG (under the direction of the 
Firm’s Controller), and includes sub-forums covering the 
CIB, CCB, CB, AWM and certain corporate functions including 
Treasury and CIO. 
Price verification process 
The VCG verifies fair value estimates provided by the risktaking functions by leveraging independently derived 
prices, valuation inputs and other market data, where 
available. Where independent prices or inputs are not 
available, the VCG performs additional review to ensure the 
reasonableness of the estimates. The additional review may 
include evaluating the limited market activity including 
client unwinds, benchmarking valuation inputs to those 
used for similar instruments, decomposing the valuation of 
structured instruments into individual components, 
comparing expected to actual cash flows, reviewing profit 
and loss trends, and reviewing trends in collateral 
valuation. There are also additional levels of management 
review for more significant or complex positions.
The VCG determines any valuation adjustments that may be 
required to the estimates provided by the risk-taking 
functions. No adjustments to quoted prices are applied for 
instruments classified within level 1 of the fair value 
hierarchy (refer to the discussion below for further 
information on the fair value hierarchy). For other 
positions, judgment is required to assess the need for 
valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect liquidity 
considerations, unobservable parameters, and, for certain 
portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net 
open risk position. The determination of such adjustments 
follows a consistent framework across the Firm:
Liquidity valuation adjustments are considered where an 
observable external price or valuation parameter exists 
but is of lower reliability, potentially due to lower 
market activity. Liquidity valuation adjustments are 
made based on current market conditions. Factors that 
may be considered in determining the liquidity 
adjustment include analysis of: (1) the estimated bidoffer spread for the instrument being traded; (2) 
alternative pricing points for similar instruments in 
active markets; and (3) the range of reasonable values 
that the price or parameter could take. 
The Firm manages certain portfolios of financial 
instruments on the basis of net open risk exposure and, 
as permitted by U.S. GAAP, has elected to estimate the 
fair value of such portfolios on the basis of a transfer of 
the entire net open risk position in an orderly 
transaction. Where this is the case, valuation 
adjustments may be necessary to reflect the cost of 
exiting a larger-than-normal market-size net open risk 
position. Where applied, such adjustments are based on 
factors that a relevant market participant would 
consider in the transfer of the net open risk position, 
including the size of the adverse market move that is 
likely to occur during the period required to reduce the 
net open risk position to a normal market-size.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Uncertainty adjustments related to unobservable 
parameters may be made when positions are valued 
using prices or input parameters to valuation models 
that are unobservable due to a lack of market activity or 
because they cannot be implied from observable market 
data. Such prices or parameters must be estimated and 
are, therefore, subject to management judgment. 
Adjustments are made to reflect the uncertainty 
inherent in the resulting valuation estimate. 
Where appropriate, the Firm also applies adjustments to 
its estimates of fair value in order to appropriately 
reflect counterparty credit quality (CVA), the Firm’s own 
creditworthiness (DVA) and the impact of funding (FVA), 
using a consistent framework across the Firm. Refer to 
Credit and funding adjustments on page 184 of this Note 
for more information on such adjustments.
Valuation model review and approval 
If prices or quotes are not available for an instrument or a 
similar instrument, fair value is generally determined using 
valuation models that consider relevant transaction terms 
such as maturity and use as inputs market-based or 
independently sourced parameters. Where this is the case 
the price verification process described above is applied to 
the inputs in those models. 
Under the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk Management 
Policy, MRGR reviews and approves new models, as well as 
material changes to existing models, prior to 
implementation in the operating environment. In certain 
circumstances exceptions may be granted to the Firm’s 
policy to allow a model to be used prior to review or 
approval. MRGR may also require the user to take 
appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be 
used in the interim. These actions will depend on the model 
and may include, for example, limitation of trading activity. 
Fair value hierarchy 
A three-level fair value hierarchy has been established 
under U.S. GAAP for disclosure of fair value measurements. 
The fair value hierarchy is based on the observability of 
inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the 
measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows. 
Level 1 – inputs to the valuation methodology are 
quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or 
liabilities in active markets. 
Level 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology include 
quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active 
markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or 
liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the 
full term of the financial instrument.
Level 3 – one or more inputs to the valuation 
methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair 
value measurement. 
A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value 
hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is 
significant to the fair value measurement.

The following table describes the valuation methodologies generally used by the Firm to measure its significant products/
instruments at fair value, including the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the fair value hierarchy. 
Product/instrument
Valuation methodology
Classifications in the fair value 
hierarchy
Securities financing agreements
Valuations are based on discounted cash flows, which consider:
Predominantly level 2
• Derivative features: refer to the discussion of derivatives below 
for further information
• Market rates for the respective maturity
• Collateral characteristics
Loans and lending-related 
commitments — wholesale
Loans carried at fair value
(trading loans and non-trading 
loans) and associated
lending-related commitments
Where observable market data is available, valuations are based on:
Level 2 or 3
• Observed market prices (circumstances are infrequent)
• Relevant broker quotes
• Observed market prices for similar instruments
Where observable market data is unavailable or limited, valuations are 
based on discounted cash flows, which consider the following:
• Credit spreads derived from the cost of CDS; or benchmark credit 
curves developed by the Firm, by industry and credit rating
• Prepayment speed
• Collateral characteristics
Loans — consumer
Fair value is based on observable market prices for mortgage-backed 
securities with similar collateral and incorporates adjustments to 
these prices to account for differences between the securities and the 
value of the underlying loans, which include credit characteristics, 
portfolio composition, and liquidity.
Predominantly level 2
Loans carried at fair value — 
conforming residential 
mortgage loans expected to be 
sold
Investment and trading 
securities
Quoted market prices
Level 1
In the absence of quoted market prices, securities are valued based 
on:
Level 2 or 3
• Observable market prices for similar securities
• Relevant broker quotes
• Discounted cash flows
In addition, the following inputs to discounted cash flows are used for 
the following products:
Mortgage- and asset-backed securities specific inputs:
• Collateral characteristics
• Deal-specific payment and loss allocations
• Current market assumptions related to yield, prepayment speed, 
conditional default rates and loss severity
Collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”) specific inputs:
• Collateral characteristics
• Deal-specific payment and loss allocations
• Expected prepayment speed, conditional default rates, loss 
severity
• Credit spreads
• Credit rating data
Physical commodities
Valued using observable market prices or data.
Level 1 or 2
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Product/instrument
Valuation methodology
Classifications in the fair value 
hierarchy
Derivatives
Actively traded derivatives, e.g., exchange-traded derivatives, that are 
valued using quoted prices.
Level 1
Derivatives that are valued using models such as the Black-Scholes 
option pricing model, simulation models, or a combination of models 
that may use observable or unobservable valuation inputs as well as 
considering the contractual terms.
The key valuation inputs used will depend on the type of derivative and 
the nature of the underlying instruments and may include equity prices, 
commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, volatilities, correlations, CDS 
spreads, recovery rates and prepayment speed.
Level 2 or 3
In addition, specific inputs used for derivatives that are valued based on 
models with significant unobservable inputs are as follows:
Interest rate and FX exotic derivatives specific inputs include:
• Interest rate curve
• Interest rate volatility
• Interest rate spread volatility
• Bermudan switch value
• Interest rate correlation
• Interest rate-FX correlation
• Foreign exchange correlation
Credit derivatives specific inputs include:
• Credit correlation between the underlying debt instruments
Equity derivatives specific inputs include:
• Forward equity price
• Equity volatility
• Equity correlation
• Equity-FX correlation
• Equity-IR correlation
Commodity derivatives specific inputs include:
• Forward commodity price
• Commodity volatility
• Commodity correlation
Additionally, adjustments are made to reflect counterparty credit quality 
(CVA) and the impact of funding (FVA). Refer to page 184 of this Note.
Mortgage servicing rights
Refer to Mortgage servicing rights in Note 15.
Level 3
Private equity direct 
investments
Fair value is estimated using all available information; the range of 
potential inputs include:
Level 2 or 3
• Transaction prices
• Trading multiples of comparable public companies
• Operating performance of the underlying portfolio company
• Adjustments as required, since comparable public companies are 
not identical to the company being valued, and for company-specific 
issues and lack of liquidity
• Additional available inputs relevant to the investment
Fund investments (e.g., 
mutual/collective investment 
funds, private equity funds, 
hedge funds, and real estate 
funds)
Net asset value
• NAV is supported by the ability to redeem and purchase at the NAV 
level
Level 1
• Adjustments to the NAV as required, for restrictions on redemption 
(e.g., lock-up periods or withdrawal limitations) or where 
observable activity is limited
Level 2 or 3(a)
Beneficial interests issued by 
consolidated VIEs
Valued using observable market information, where available.
Level 2 or 3
In the absence of observable market information, valuations are based 
on the fair value of the underlying assets held by the VIE.
(a) Excludes certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient.

Valuation methodology
Classification in the fair value 
hierarchy
Structured notes (included in 
deposits, short-term 
borrowings and long-term 
debt)
Valuations are based on discounted cash flow analyses that consider the 
embedded derivative and the terms and payment structure of the note.
The embedded derivative features are considered using models such as 
the Black-Scholes option pricing model, simulation models, or a 
combination of models that may use observable or unobservable 
valuation inputs, depending on the embedded derivative. The specific 
inputs used vary according to the nature of the embedded derivative 
features, as described in the discussion above regarding derivatives 
valuation. Adjustments are then made to this base valuation to reflect 
the Firm’s own credit risk (DVA). Refer to page 184 of this Note.

(a) At December 31, 2022 and 2021, included total U.S. GSE obligations of $73.8 billion and $73.9 billion, respectively, which were mortgage-related.
(b) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net realizable value” is a term defined in U.S. 
GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not 
applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities 
inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities 
approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 5 for a further 
discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have 
been included in each period presented.
(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions).
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be 
classified in the fair value hierarchy. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private 
equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $950 million and $801 million, respectively. Included in these balances at December 31, 2022 and 2021, 
were trading assets of $43 million and $51 million, respectively, and other assets of $907 million and $750 million, respectively.
(e) At December 31, 2022 and 2021, included $9.7 billion and $26.2 billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $6.8 billion and $8.2 
billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell 
to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $2.4 billion and $13.6 billion, respectively.
(f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid 
when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit 
associated with cash collateral.

Level 3 valuations
The Firm has established well-structured processes for 
determining fair value, including for instruments where fair 
value is estimated using significant unobservable inputs 
(level 3). Refer to pages 167-171 of this Note for further 
information on the Firm’s valuation process and a detailed 
discussion of the determination of fair value for individual 
financial instruments. 
Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. 
The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent 
on the amount of observable market information available to 
the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed 
valuation models and other valuation techniques that use 
significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified 
within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to 
estimate fair value are more significant than those required 
when estimating the fair value of instruments classified 
within levels 1 and 2. 
In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument 
within level 3, management must first determine the 
appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to 
use. Second, due to the lack of observability of significant 
inputs, management must assess relevant empirical data in 
deriving valuation inputs including transaction details, yield 
curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates, 
volatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or 
debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments, foreign 
exchange rates and credit curves. 
The following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3 
financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to 
measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the 
significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those 
inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of such 
inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument 
within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable 
inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial 
instruments typically include observable components (that is, 
components that are actively quoted and can be validated to 
external sources) in addition to the unobservable 
components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not 
included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk 
of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments 
using securities and derivative positions that are classified 
within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
The range of values presented in the table is representative 
of the highest and lowest level input used to value the 
significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument 
classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the 
input values presented in the table are calculated based on 
the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used 
to value. 
In the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic 
average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty 
or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s 
estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the 
characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm 
and the relative distribution of instruments within the range 
of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may 
have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation 
uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied 
volatility levels because the option contracts have different 
underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and 
weighted average values will therefore vary from period-toperiod and parameter-to-parameter based on the 
characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each 
balance sheet date.

(a) The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from their classification on the Consolidated 
balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued 
using the technique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ.
(b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $752 million, nonagency securities of $5 million and non-trading loans of $892 million.
(c) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $7 million, nonagency securities of $7 million, trading loans of $40 million and non-trading loans of 
$369 million. 
(d) Comprises trading loans of $719 million and non-trading loans of $157 million.
(e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are financial instruments that typically contain 
embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant 
unobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.
(f) Includes equity securities of $880 million including $216 million in Other assets, for which quoted prices are not readily available and the fair value is 
generally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA multiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant 
both individually and in aggregate.
(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed on pricebased internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a par value of $100.
(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.
(i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are used.

Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs 
The following discussion provides a description of the impact 
on a fair value measurement of a change in each 
unobservable input in isolation, and the interrelationship 
between unobservable inputs, where relevant and significant. 
The impact of changes in inputs may not be independent, as a 
change in one unobservable input may give rise to a change 
in another unobservable input. Where relationships do exist 
between two unobservable inputs, those relationships are 
discussed below. Relationships may also exist between 
observable and unobservable inputs (for example, as 
observable interest rates rise, unobservable prepayment 
rates decline); such relationships have not been included in 
the discussion below. In addition, for each of the individual 
relationships described below, the inverse relationship would 
also generally apply. 
The following discussion also provides a description of 
attributes of the underlying instruments and external market 
factors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of 
the Firm’s positions. 
Yield – The yield of an asset is the interest rate used to 
discount future cash flows in a discounted cash flow 
calculation. An increase in the yield, in isolation, would result 
in a decrease in a fair value measurement. 
Credit spread – The credit spread is the amount of additional 
annualized return over the market interest rate that a market 
participant would demand for taking exposure to the credit 
risk of an instrument. The credit spread for an instrument 
forms part of the discount rate used in a discounted cash flow 
calculation. Generally, an increase in the credit spread would 
result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. 
The yield and the credit spread of a particular mortgagebacked security primarily reflect the risk inherent in the 
instrument. The yield is also impacted by the absolute level of 
the coupon paid by the instrument (which may not 
correspond directly to the level of inherent risk). Therefore, 
the range of yield and credit spreads reflects the range of risk 
inherent in various instruments owned by the Firm. The risk 
inherent in mortgage-backed securities is driven by the 
subordination of the security being valued and the 
characteristics of the underlying mortgages within the 
collateralized pool, including borrower FICO scores, LTV 
ratios for residential mortgages and the nature of the 
property and/or any tenants for commercial mortgages. For 
corporate debt securities, obligations of U.S. states and 
municipalities and other similar instruments, credit spreads 
reflect the credit quality of the obligor and the tenor of the 
obligation. 
Prepayment speed – The prepayment speed is a measure of 
the voluntary unscheduled principal repayments of a 
prepayable obligation in a collateralized pool. Prepayment 
speeds generally decline as borrower delinquencies rise. An 
increase in prepayment speeds, in isolation, would result in a 
decrease in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a 
premium to par and an increase in a fair value measurement 
of assets valued at a discount to par. 
Prepayment speeds may vary from collateral pool to 
collateral pool, and are driven by the type and location of the 
underlying borrower, and the remaining tenor of the 
obligation as well as the level and type (e.g., fixed or floating) 
of interest rate being paid by the borrower. Typically 
collateral pools with higher borrower credit quality have a 
higher prepayment rate than those with lower borrower 
credit quality, all other factors being equal. 
Conditional default rate – The conditional default rate is a 
measure of the reduction in the outstanding collateral 
balance underlying a collateralized obligation as a result of 
defaults. While there is typically no direct relationship 
between conditional default rates and prepayment speeds, 
collateralized obligations for which the underlying collateral 
has high prepayment speeds will tend to have lower 
conditional default rates. An increase in conditional default 
rates would generally be accompanied by an increase in loss 
severity and an increase in credit spreads. An increase in the 
conditional default rate, in isolation, would result in a 
decrease in a fair value measurement. Conditional default 
rates reflect the quality of the collateral underlying a 
securitization and the structure of the securitization itself. 
Based on the types of securities owned in the Firm’s marketmaking portfolios, conditional default rates are most typically 
at the lower end of the range presented. 
Loss severity – The loss severity (the inverse concept is the 
recovery rate) is the expected amount of future realized 
losses resulting from the ultimate liquidation of a particular 
loan, expressed as the net amount of loss relative to the 
outstanding loan balance. An increase in loss severity is 
generally accompanied by an increase in conditional default 
rates. An increase in the loss severity, in isolation, would 
result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. 
The loss severity applied in valuing a mortgage-backed 
security investment depends on factors relating to the 
underlying mortgages, including the LTV ratio, the nature of 
the lender’s lien on the property and other instrumentspecific factors.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Correlation – Correlation is a measure of the relationship 
between the movements of two variables. Correlation is a 
pricing input for a derivative product where the payoff is 
driven by one or more underlying risks. Correlation inputs are 
related to the type of derivative (e.g., interest rate, credit, 
equity, foreign exchange and commodity) due to the nature 
of the underlying risks. When parameters are positively 
correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in an 
increase in the other parameter. When parameters are 
negatively correlated, an increase in one parameter will 
result in a decrease in the other parameter. An increase in 
correlation can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair 
value measurement. Given a short correlation position, an 
increase in correlation, in isolation, would generally result in 
a decrease in a fair value measurement.
The level of correlation used in the valuation of derivatives 
with multiple underlying risks depends on a number of 
factors including the nature of those risks. For example, the 
correlation between two credit risk exposures would be 
different than that between two interest rate risk exposures. 
Similarly, the tenor of the transaction may also impact the 
correlation input, as the relationship between the underlying 
risks may be different over different time periods. 
Furthermore, correlation levels are very much dependent on 
market conditions and could have a relatively wide range of 
levels within or across asset classes over time, particularly in 
volatile market conditions. 
Volatility – Volatility is a measure of the variability in possible 
returns for an instrument, parameter or market index given 
how much the particular instrument, parameter or index 
changes in value over time. Volatility is a pricing input for 
options, including equity options, commodity options, and 
interest rate options. Generally, the higher the volatility of 
the underlying, the riskier the instrument. Given a long 
position in an option, an increase in volatility, in isolation, 
would generally result in an increase in a fair value 
measurement. 
The level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular 
option-based derivative depends on a number of factors, 
including the nature of the risk underlying the option (e.g., 
the volatility of a particular equity security may be 
significantly different from that of a particular commodity 
index), the tenor of the derivative as well as the strike price 
of the option. 
Bermudan switch value – The switch value is the difference 
between the overall value of a Bermudan swaption, which can 
be exercised at multiple points in time, and its most 
expensive European swaption and reflects the additional 
value that the multiple exercise dates provide the holder. 
Switch values are dependent on market conditions and can 
vary greatly depending on a number of factors, such as the 
tenor of the underlying swap as well as the strike price of the 
option. An increase in switch value, in isolation, would 
generally result in an increase in a fair value measurement.
Interest rate curve – represents the relationship of interest 
rates over differing tenors. The interest rate curve is used to 
set interest rate and foreign exchange derivative cash flows 
and is also a pricing input used in the discounting of any 
derivative cash flow. 
Forward price – Forward price is the price at which the buyer 
agrees to purchase the asset underlying a forward contract 
on the predetermined future delivery date, and is such that 
the value of the contract is zero at inception. 
The forward price is used as an input in the valuation of 
certain derivatives and depends on a number of factors 
including interest rates, the current price of the underlying 
asset, and the expected income to be received and costs to be 
incurred by the seller as a result of holding that asset until 
the delivery date. An increase in the forward can result in an 
increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement. 
Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements 
The following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated 
balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for 
financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of 
the fair value hierarchy for the years ended December 31, 
2022, 2021 and 2020. When a determination is made to 
classify a financial instrument within level 3, the 
determination is based on the significance of the 
unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. 
However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in 
addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, 
observable components (that is, components that are actively 
quoted and can be validated to external sources); 
accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include 
changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that 
are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm riskmanages the observable components of level 3 financial 
instruments using securities and derivative positions that are 
classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as 
these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are 
not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables 
do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management 
activities related to such level 3 instruments.

Credit and funding adjustments – derivatives
Derivatives are generally valued using models that use as 
their basis observable market parameters. These market 
parameters generally do not consider factors such as 
counterparty nonperformance risk, the Firm’s own credit 
quality, and funding costs. Therefore, it is generally 
necessary to make adjustments to the base estimate of fair 
value to reflect these factors.
CVA represents the adjustment, relative to the relevant 
benchmark interest rate, necessary to reflect counterparty 
nonperformance risk. The Firm estimates CVA using a 
scenario analysis to estimate the expected positive credit 
exposure across all of the Firm’s existing positions with 
each counterparty, and then estimates losses based on the 
probability of default and estimated recovery rate as a 
result of a counterparty credit event considering 
contractual factors designed to mitigate the Firm’s credit 
exposure, such as collateral and legal rights of offset. The 
key inputs to this methodology are (i) the probability of a 
default event occurring for each counterparty, as derived 
from observed or estimated CDS spreads; and (ii) estimated 
recovery rates implied by CDS spreads, adjusted to consider 
the differences in recovery rates as a derivative creditor 
relative to those reflected in CDS spreads, which generally 
reflect senior unsecured creditor risk.
FVA represents the adjustment to reflect the impact of 
funding and is recognized where there is evidence that a 
market participant in the principal market would 
incorporate it in a transfer of the instrument. The Firm’s 
FVA framework, applied to uncollateralized (including 
partially collateralized) over-the-counter (“OTC”) 
derivatives incorporates key inputs such as: (i) the expected 
funding requirements arising from the Firm’s positions with 
each counterparty and collateral arrangements; and (ii) the 
estimated market funding cost in the principal market 
which, for derivative liabilities, considers the Firm’s credit 
risk (DVA). For collateralized derivatives, the fair value is 
estimated by discounting expected future cash flows at the 
relevant overnight indexed swap rate given the underlying 
collateral agreement with the counterparty, and therefore a 
separate FVA is not necessary.
The following table provides the impact of credit and 
funding adjustments on principal transactions revenue in 
the respective periods, excluding the effect of any 
associated hedging activities. The FVA presented below 
includes the impact of the Firm’s own credit quality on the 
inception value of liabilities as well as the impact of changes 
in the Firm’s own credit quality over time.

Valuation adjustments on fair value option elected 
liabilities
The valuation of the Firm’s liabilities for which the fair value 
option has been elected requires consideration of the Firm’s 
own credit risk. DVA on fair value option elected liabilities 
reflects changes (subsequent to the issuance of the liability) 
in the Firm’s probability of default and LGD, which are 
estimated based on changes in the Firm’s credit spread 
observed in the bond market. Realized (gains)/losses due to 
DVA for fair value option elected liabilities are reported in 
principal transactions revenue. Unrealized (gains)/losses 
are reported in OCI. Refer to page 182 in this Note and Note 
24 for further information.

(a) Primarily includes equity securities without readily determinable fair values that were adjusted based on observable price changes in orderly transactions 
from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (measurement alternative). Of the $1.4 billion in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a 
nonrecurring basis as of December 31, 2022, $1.2 billion related to equity securities adjusted based on the measurement alternative. These equity 
securities are classified as level 3 due to the infrequency of the observable prices and/or the restrictions on the shares.
(b) Of the $627 million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of December 31, 2022, $83 million related to residential real 
estate loans carried at the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (e.g., collateral-dependent loans). These amounts are classified as level 3 as 
they are valued using information from broker’s price opinions, appraisals and automated valuation models and discounted based upon the Firm’s 
experience with actual liquidation values. These discounts ranged from 9% to 56% with a weighted average of 23%.

Equity securities without readily determinable fair values 
The Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or 
minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (i.e., measurement alternative), 
with such changes recognized in other income. 
In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if deemed 
necessary to arrive at the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect the different 
rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the Firm’s valuation techniques for 
private equity direct investments. 
The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held as of 
December 31, 2022 and 2021, that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments recorded 
during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are included in the 
nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.

(a) The period-end carrying values reflect cumulative purchases and sales in addition to upward and downward carrying value changes. 
(b) The cumulative upward carrying value changes between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2022 were $1.4 billion.
(c) The cumulative downward carrying value changes/impairment between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2022 were $(918) million. 
Included in other assets above is the Firm’s interest in Visa Class B common shares (“Visa B shares”) recorded at a nominal 
carrying value. In November 2022, the Firm sold approximately 3 million Visa B shares, resulting in a net pretax gain of 
$914 million recorded in other income. Visa B shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and are convertible into Visa 
Class A common shares (“Visa A shares”) at a specified conversion rate upon final resolution of certain litigation matters 
involving Visa. In connection with the sale, and consistent with the Firm’s sale of 20 million Visa B shares in 2013, the Firm 
entered into a derivative instrument with the purchaser of the shares, under which the Firm retains the risk associated with 
changes in the conversion rate. 
Under the terms of the derivative instrument, the Firm will (a) make or receive payments based on subsequent changes in the 
conversion rate and (b) make periodic interest payments to the purchaser of the Visa B shares. The payments under the 
derivative continue as long as the Visa B shares remain subject to transfer restrictions. The derivative is accounted for at fair 
value using a discounted cash flow methodology based upon the Firm’s estimate of the timing and magnitude of final 
resolution of the litigation matters. The derivative is recorded in trading liabilities and changes in fair value are recognized in 
other income. As of December 31, 2022, the Firm held derivative instruments associated with the 23 million Visa B shares 
that it has sold, which are all subject to similar terms and conditions.
As of December 31, 2022, the Firm’s remaining interest in Visa B shares was approximately 37 million shares. On January 5, 
2023, Visa filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC indicating that the conversion rate of Visa B shares to Visa A 
shares decreased from 1.6059 to 1.5991 effective December 29, 2022. The conversion rate may be further adjusted by Visa 
depending on developments related to the litigation matters. The outcome of those litigation matters, and the effect that the 
resolution of those matters may have on the conversion rate, is unknown, and accordingly, as of December 31, 2022, there is 
significant uncertainty regarding the date of the termination of transfer restrictions and the value of the final conversion rate. 
As a result of this, as well as differences in voting rights, Visa B shares are not considered to be similar to Visa A shares, and 
they continue to be held at their nominal carrying value. 
Additional disclosures about the fair value of financial 
instruments that are not carried on the Consolidated 
balance sheets at fair value 
U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of 
certain financial instruments, which are included in the 
following table. However, this table does not include other 
items, such as nonfinancial assets, intangible assets, certain 
financial instruments, and customer relationships. In the 
opinion of management, these items, in the aggregate, add 
significant value to JPMorgan Chase, but their fair value is 
not disclosed in this table. 
Financial instruments for which carrying value approximates 
fair value 
Certain financial instruments that are not carried at fair 
value on the Consolidated balance sheets are carried at 
amounts that approximate fair value, due to their shortterm nature and generally negligible credit risk. These 
instruments include cash and due from banks, deposits with

receivables and accrued interest receivable, short-term 
borrowings, federal funds purchased, securities loaned and 
sold under repurchase agreements, accounts payable, and

accrued liabilities. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires that the 
fair value of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., 
demand, savings and certain money market deposits) be 
equal to their carrying value; recognition of the inherent 
funding value of these instruments is not permitted. 
The following table presents, by fair value hierarchy classification, the carrying values and estimated fair values at

(a) Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of the underlying loans (including principal, 
contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and 
primary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. Carrying 
value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s expected credit losses over its remaining expected 
life. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including 
credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value. 
(b) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.
The majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated

follows for the periods indicated.

The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. In many cases, the Firm 
can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without 
notice. Refer to page 169 of this Note for a further discussion of the valuation of lending-related commitments.

Note 3 – Fair value option 
The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value 
for selected financial assets, financial liabilities, 
unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan 
commitments.
The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair 
value for several reasons including to mitigate income 
statement volatility caused by the differences between the 
measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain 
instruments that otherwise would be accounted for on an 
accrual basis) and the associated risk management 
arrangements that are accounted for on a fair value basis, 
as well as to better reflect those instruments that are 
managed on a fair value basis. 
The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following 
instruments: 
Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization 
warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting, 
or managed on a fair value basis, including lendingrelated commitments
Certain securities financing agreements
Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would 
otherwise be required to be separately accounted for as 
a derivative instrument 
Structured notes and other hybrid instruments, which 
are predominantly financial instruments that contain 
embedded derivatives, that are issued or transacted as 
part of client-driven activities 
Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by CIB’s 
consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying 
assets are carried at fair value

Determination of instrument-specific credit risk for items 
for which the fair value option was elected 
The following describes how the gains and losses that are 
attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, 
were determined. 
Loans and lending-related commitments: For floatingrate instruments, all changes in value are attributed to 
instrument-specific credit risk. For fixed-rate 
instruments, an allocation of the changes in value for 
the period is made between those changes in value that 
are interest rate-related and changes in value that are 
credit-related. Allocations are generally based on an 
analysis of borrower-specific credit spread and recovery 
information, where available, or benchmarking to 
similar entities or industries. 
Long-term debt: Changes in value attributable to 
instrument-specific credit risk were derived principally 
from observable changes in the Firm’s credit spread as 
observed in the bond market. 
Securities financing agreements: Generally, for these 
types of agreements, there is a requirement that 
collateral be maintained with a market value equal to or 
in excess of the principal amount loaned; as a result, 
there would be no adjustment or an immaterial 
adjustment for instrument-specific credit risk related to 
these agreements.

(b) There were no performing loans that were ninety days or more past due as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.
(c) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected 
structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipalprotected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for 
structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors 
are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.
(d) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity or, if 
applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date.
(e) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair value option was 
elected was $7.6 billion and $11.9 billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $24 million and $10 million, 
respectively. Refer to Note 28 for further information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments.

Note 4 – Credit risk concentrations
Concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of clients, 
counterparties or customers are engaged in similar 
business activities or activities in the same geographic 
region, or when they have similar economic features that 
would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to 
be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions.
JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its 
credit portfolios to assess potential credit risk 
concentrations and to obtain additional collateral when 
deemed necessary and permitted under the Firm’s 
agreements. Senior management is significantly involved in 
the credit approval and review process, and risk levels are 
adjusted as needed to reflect the Firm’s risk appetite.
In the Firm’s consumer portfolio, concentrations are 
managed primarily by product and by U.S. geographic 
region, with a key focus on trends and concentrations at the 
portfolio level, where potential credit risk concentrations 
can be remedied through changes in underwriting policies 
and portfolio guidelines. Refer to Note 12 for additional 
information on the geographic composition of the Firm’s 
consumer loan portfolios. In the wholesale portfolio, credit 
risk concentrations are evaluated primarily by industry and 
monitored regularly on both an aggregate portfolio level 
and on an individual client or counterparty basis. 
The Firm’s wholesale exposure is managed through loan 
syndications and participations, loan sales, securitizations, 
credit derivatives, master netting agreements, collateral 
and other risk-reduction techniques. Refer to Note 12 for 
additional information on loans. 
The Firm does not believe that its exposure to any 
particular loan product or industry segment results in a 
significant concentration of credit risk. 
Terms of loan products and collateral coverage are included 
in the Firm’s assessment when extending credit and 
establishing its allowance for loan losses.

(a) Also includes commercial card lending-related commitments primarily in CB and CIB.
(b) The industry rankings presented in the table as of December 31, 2021, are based on the industry rankings of the corresponding exposures at 
December 31, 2022, not actual rankings of such exposures at December 31, 2021.
(c) Individuals and Individual Entities predominantly consists of Global Private Bank clients within AWM and J.P. Morgan Wealth Management within CCB, and 
includes exposure to personal investment companies and personal and testamentary trusts.
(d) In addition to the credit risk exposure to states and municipal governments (both U.S. and non-U.S.) at December 31, 2022 and 2021, noted above, the 
Firm held: $6.6 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively, of trading assets; $6.8 billion and $15.9 billion, respectively, of AFS securities; and $19.7 billion and 
$14.0 billion, respectively, of HTM securities, issued by U.S. state and municipal governments. Refer to Note 2 and Note 10 for further information.
(e) All other includes: SPEs and Private education and civic organizations, representing approximately 95% and 5%, respectively, at December 31, 2022 and 
94% and 6%, respectively, at December 31, 2021. Refer to Note 14 for more information on exposures to SPEs.
(f) Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by assets 
maintained in the clients’ brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, liquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of this 
collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is generally held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk the Firm establishes margin 
requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to reduce 
positions, when appropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.
(g) Excludes cash placed with banks of $556.6 billion and $729.6 billion, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which is predominantly placed with 
various central banks, primarily Federal Reserve Banks.
(h) Credit exposure is net of risk participations and excludes the benefit of credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities held against 
derivative receivables or loans and liquid securities and other cash collateral held against derivative receivables.
(i) At December 31, 2022 and 2021, included $350 million and $5.4 billion of loans in Business Banking under the PPP, respectively. PPP loans are 
guaranteed by the SBA. Other than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm typically does not recognize charge-offs, classify as nonaccrual nor record an 
allowance for loan losses on these loans.
(j) Represents lending-related financial instruments.

Note 5 – Derivative instruments 
Derivative contracts derive their value from underlying 
asset prices, indices, reference rates, other inputs or a 
combination of these factors and may expose 
counterparties to risks and rewards of an underlying asset 
or liability without having to initially invest in, own or 
exchange the asset or liability. JPMorgan Chase makes 
markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives 
to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. Predominantly 
all of the Firm’s derivatives are entered into for marketmaking or risk management purposes. 
Market-making derivatives 
The majority of the Firm’s derivatives are entered into for 
market-making purposes. Clients use derivatives to mitigate 
or modify interest rate, credit, foreign exchange, equity and 
commodity risks. The Firm actively manages the risks from 
its exposure to these derivatives by entering into other 
derivative contracts or by purchasing or selling other 
financial instruments that partially or fully offset the 
exposure from client derivatives. 
Risk management derivatives 
The Firm manages certain market and credit risk exposures 
using derivative instruments, including derivatives in hedge 
accounting relationships and other derivatives that are used 
to manage risks associated with specified assets and 
liabilities. 
The Firm generally uses interest rate derivatives to manage 
the risk associated with changes in interest rates. Fixed-rate 
assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in market 
value as interest rates change. Similarly, interest income 
and expense increase or decrease as a result of variablerate assets and liabilities resetting to current market rates, 
and as a result of the repayment and subsequent 
origination or issuance of fixed-rate assets and liabilities at 
current market rates. Gains and losses on the derivative 
instruments related to these assets and liabilities are 
expected to substantially offset this variability. 
Foreign currency derivatives are used to manage the 
foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign 
currency–denominated (i.e., non-U.S. dollar) assets and 
liabilities and forecasted transactions, as well as the Firm’s 
net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches 
whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. As a 
result of fluctuations in foreign currencies, the U.S. dollar–
equivalent values of the foreign currency–denominated 
assets and liabilities or the forecasted revenues or expenses 
increase or decrease. Gains or losses on the derivative 
instruments related to these foreign currency–denominated 
assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions, are expected 
to substantially offset this variability. 
Commodities derivatives are used to manage the price risk 
of certain commodities inventories. Gains or losses on these 
derivative instruments are expected to substantially offset 
the depreciation or appreciation of the related inventory. 
Credit derivatives are used to manage the counterparty 
credit risk associated with loans and lending-related 
commitments. Credit derivatives compensate the purchaser 
when the entity referenced in the contract experiences a 
credit event, such as bankruptcy or a failure to pay an 
obligation when due. Credit derivatives primarily consist of 
CDS. Refer to the Credit derivatives section on pages 
205-207 of this Note for a further discussion of credit 
derivatives. 
Refer to the risk management derivatives gains and losses 
table on page 205 and the hedge accounting gains and 
losses tables on pages 202-204 of this Note for more 
information about risk management derivatives. 
Derivative counterparties and settlement types 
The Firm enters into OTC derivatives, which are negotiated 
and settled bilaterally with the derivative counterparty. The 
Firm also enters into, as principal, certain ETD such as 
futures and options, and OTC-cleared derivative contracts 
with CCPs. ETD contracts are generally standardized 
contracts traded on an exchange and cleared by the CCP, 
which is the Firm’s counterparty from the inception of the 
transactions. OTC-cleared derivatives are traded on a 
bilateral basis and then novated to the CCP for clearing. 
Derivative clearing services 
The Firm provides clearing services for clients in which the 
Firm acts as a clearing member at certain exchanges and 
clearing houses. The Firm does not reflect the clients’ 
derivative contracts in its Consolidated Financial 
Statements. Refer to Note 28 for further information on the 
Firm’s clearing services. 
Accounting for derivatives 
All free-standing derivatives that the Firm executes for its 
own account are required to be recorded on the 
Consolidated balance sheets at fair value. 
As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm nets derivative 
assets and liabilities, and the related cash collateral 
receivables and payables, when a legally enforceable 
master netting agreement exists between the Firm and the 
derivative counterparty. Refer to Note 1 for further 
discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities. The 
accounting for changes in value of a derivative depends on 
whether or not the transaction has been designated and 
qualifies for hedge accounting. Derivatives that are not 
designated as hedges are reported and measured at fair 
value through earnings. The tabular disclosures on pages 
198-205 of this Note provide additional information on the 
amount of, and reporting for, derivative assets, liabilities, 
gains and losses. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for a further 
discussion of derivatives embedded in structured notes. 
Notes to consolidated financial statements

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Derivatives designated as hedges 
The Firm applies hedge accounting to certain derivatives 
executed for risk management purposes – generally interest 
rate, foreign exchange and commodity derivatives. 
However, JPMorgan Chase does not seek to apply hedge 
accounting to all of the derivatives associated with the 
Firm’s risk management activities. For example, the Firm 
does not apply hedge accounting to purchased CDS used to 
manage the credit risk of loans and lending-related 
commitments, because of the difficulties in qualifying such 
contracts as hedges. For the same reason, the Firm does 
not apply hedge accounting to certain interest rate, foreign 
exchange, and commodity derivatives used for risk 
management purposes. 
To qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly 
effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure 
being hedged. In addition, for a derivative to be designated 
as a hedge, the risk management objective and strategy 
must be documented. Hedge documentation must identify 
the derivative hedging instrument, the asset or liability or 
forecasted transaction and type of risk to be hedged, and 
how the effectiveness of the derivative is assessed 
prospectively and retrospectively. To assess effectiveness, 
the Firm uses statistical methods such as regression 
analysis, nonstatistical methods such as dollar-value 
comparisons of the change in the fair value of the derivative 
to the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged 
item, and qualitative comparisons of critical terms and the 
evaluation of any changes in those terms. The extent to 
which a derivative has been, and is expected to continue to 
be, highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value or 
cash flows of the hedged item must be assessed and 
documented at least quarterly. If it is determined that a 
derivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated 
exposure, hedge accounting is discontinued. 
There are three types of hedge accounting designations: fair 
value hedges, cash flow hedges and net investment hedges. 
JPMorgan Chase uses fair value hedges primarily to hedge 
fixed-rate long-term debt, AFS securities and certain 
commodities inventories. For qualifying fair value hedges, 
the changes in the fair value of the derivative, and in the 
value of the hedged item for the risk being hedged, are 
recognized in earnings. Certain amounts excluded from the 
assessment of effectiveness are recorded in OCI and 
recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative. If the 
hedge relationship is terminated, then the adjustment to 
the hedged item continues to be reported as part of the 
basis of the hedged item, and for benchmark interest rate 
hedges, is amortized to earnings as a yield adjustment. 
Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized 
consistent with the classification of the hedged item – 
primarily net interest income and principal transactions 
revenue. 
JPMorgan Chase uses cash flow hedges primarily to hedge 
the exposure to variability in forecasted cash flows from 
floating-rate assets and liabilities and foreign currency–
denominated revenue and expense. For qualifying cash flow 
hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are 
recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings as the hedged 
item affects earnings. Derivative amounts affecting 
earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of 
the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue, net 
interest income and compensation expense. If the hedge 
relationship is terminated, then the change in value of the 
derivative recorded in AOCI is recognized in earnings when 
the cash flows that were hedged affect earnings. For hedge 
relationships that are discontinued because a forecasted 
transaction is expected to not occur according to the 
original hedge forecast, any related derivative values 
recorded in AOCI are immediately recognized in earnings. 
JPMorgan Chase uses net investment hedges to protect the 
value of the Firm’s net investments in certain non-U.S. 
subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are 
not the U.S. dollar. For qualifying net investment hedges, 
changes in the fair value of the derivatives due to changes 
in spot foreign exchange rates are recorded in OCI as 
translation adjustments. Amounts excluded from the 
assessment of effectiveness are recorded directly in 
earnings.

Derivatives netting
The following tables present, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, gross and net derivative receivables and payables by 
contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from the same 
counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion 
with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, amounts are 
not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are shown 
separately in the tables below. 
In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables and 
payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate 
counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation: 
• collateral that consists of liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are shown 
separately as "Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets" in the tables below, up to the fair value exposure 
amount. For the purpose of this disclosure, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality 
liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule; 
• the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty level, as of 
the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and 
• collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not 
been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from the tables below.

Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features
In addition to the specific market risks introduced by each derivative contract type, derivatives expose JPMorgan Chase to 
credit risk — the risk that derivative counterparties may fail to meet their payment obligations under the derivative contracts 
and the collateral, if any, held by the Firm proves to be of insufficient value to cover the payment obligation. It is the policy of 
JPMorgan Chase to actively pursue, where possible, the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral 
agreements to mitigate derivative counterparty credit risk inherent in derivative receivables.
While derivative receivables expose the Firm to credit risk, derivative payables expose the Firm to liquidity risk, as the 
derivative contracts typically require the Firm to post cash or securities collateral with counterparties as the fair value of the 
contracts moves in the counterparties’ favor or upon specified downgrades in the Firm’s and its subsidiaries’ respective credit 
ratings. Certain derivative contracts also provide for termination of the contract, generally upon a downgrade of either the 
Firm or the counterparty, at the fair value of the derivative contracts. The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net 
derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that 
may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of 
business, at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of JPMorgan 
Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at December 31, 2022 and 2021, related to OTC 
and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings 
downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the 
predefined rating threshold is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a 
preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral 
(except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination 
payment requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating 
of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.

Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset
In certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the economic exposure 
to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer. The 
Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note 11, but in limited 
circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers 
accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative was outstanding was not material at both December 31, 2022 and 
2021.

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of the benchmark (e.g., Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”)) interest rate 
risk of fixed-rate long-term debt and AFS securities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income. 
(b) Effective January 1, 2022, the Firm updated its presentation in the tables above to include the amortization of income/expense associated with the

Excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged items.
(c) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses 
related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were 
recorded primarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income.
(d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value (net 
realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.
(e) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward 
points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-currency basis spreads. Excluded components may impact earnings either through 
amortization of the initial amount over the life of the derivative or through fair value changes recognized in the current period. 
(f) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization approach, predominantly crosscurrency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative.

(a) Excludes physical commodities with a carrying value of $26.0 billion and $25.7 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, to which the Firm 
applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing 
unrealized gains and losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to net income in future 
periods.
(b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments related to foreign currency hedges will not 
reverse through the income statement in future periods. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying amount excluded for AFS securities is

The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the years ended 2022, 2021 and 2020.
Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $(1.5) billion (after-tax) of net losses recorded in AOCI at 
December 31, 2022, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have been 
terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized in earnings is 
approximately seven years, corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash flows. For open cash flow 
hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately seven years. The Firm’s 
longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities.

principal transactions revenue.
(c) Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate foreign exchange risk 
of specified foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Gains

Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making 
activities and other derivatives 
The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the 
needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain 
risks associated with net open risk positions from its 
market-making activities, including the counterparty credit 
risk arising from derivative receivables. All derivatives not 
included in the hedge accounting or specified risk 
management categories above are included in this 
category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are 
primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer 
to Note 6 for information on principal transactions revenue. 
Credit derivatives 
Credit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is 
derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a 
third-party issuer (the reference entity) and which allow 
one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to 
another party (the protection seller). Credit derivatives 
expose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of 
the protection seller, as the protection seller is required to 
make payments under the contract when the reference 
entity experiences a credit event, such as a bankruptcy, a 
failure to pay its obligation or a restructuring. The seller of 
credit protection receives a premium for providing 
protection but has the risk that the underlying instrument 
referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event. 
The Firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the 
credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two 
primary purposes. First, in its capacity as a market-maker, 
the Firm actively manages a portfolio of credit derivatives 
by purchasing and selling credit protection, predominantly 
on corporate debt obligations, to meet the needs of 
customers. Second, as an end-user, the Firm uses credit 
derivatives to manage credit risk associated with lending 
exposures (loans and unfunded commitments) in its 
wholesale and consumer businesses and derivatives 
counterparty exposures in its wholesale businesses, and to 
manage the credit risk arising from certain financial 
instruments in the Firm’s market-making businesses. 
Following is a summary of various types of credit 
derivatives. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Credit default swaps 
Credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single 
reference entity (“single-name”), broad-based index or 
portfolio. The Firm purchases and sells protection on both 
single- name and index-reference obligations. Single-name 
CDS and index CDS contracts are either OTC or OTC-cleared 
derivative contracts. Single-name CDS are used to manage 
the default risk of a single reference entity, while index CDS 
contracts are used to manage the credit risk associated with 
the broader credit markets or credit market segments. Like 
the S&P 500 and other market indices, a CDS index consists 
of a portfolio of CDS across many reference entities. New 
series of CDS indices are periodically established with a new 
underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes 
in the credit markets. If one of the reference entities in the 
index experiences a credit event, then the reference entity 
that defaulted is removed from the index. CDS can also be 
referenced against specific portfolios of reference names or 
against customized exposure levels based on specific client 
demands: for example, to provide protection against the 
first $1 million of realized credit losses in a $10 million 
portfolio of exposure. Such structures are commonly known 
as tranche CDS. 
For both single-name CDS contracts and index CDS 
contracts, upon the occurrence of a credit event, under the 
terms of a CDS contract neither party to the CDS contract 
has recourse to the reference entity. The protection 
purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the 
difference between the face value of the CDS contract and 
the fair value of the reference obligation at settlement of 
the credit derivative contract, also known as the recovery 
value. The protection purchaser does not need to hold the 
debt instrument of the underlying reference entity in order 
to receive amounts due under the CDS contract when a 
credit event occurs. 
Credit-related notes 
A credit-related note is a funded derivative with a credit risk 
component where the issuer of the credit-related note 
purchases from the note investor credit protection on a 
reference entity or an index. Under the contract, the 
investor pays the issuer the par value of the note at the 
inception of the transaction, and in return, the issuer pays 
periodic payments to the investor, based on the credit risk 
of the referenced entity. The issuer also repays the investor 
the par value of the note at maturity unless the reference 
entity (or one of the entities that makes up a reference 
index) experiences a specified credit event. If a credit event 
occurs, the issuer is not obligated to repay the par value of 
the note, but rather, the issuer pays the investor the 
difference between the par value of the note and the fair 
value of the defaulted reference obligation at the time of 
settlement. Neither party to the credit-related note has 
recourse to the defaulting reference entity.
The following tables present a summary of the notional 
amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the 
Firm sold and purchased as of December 31, 2022 and 
2021. Upon a credit event, the Firm as a seller of protection 
would typically pay out only a percentage of the full 
notional amount of net protection sold, as the amount 
actually required to be paid on the contracts takes into 
account the recovery value of the reference obligation at 
the time of settlement. The Firm manages the credit risk on 
contracts to sell protection by purchasing protection with 
identical or similar underlying reference entities. Other 
purchased protection referenced in the following tables 
includes credit derivatives bought on related, but not 
identical, reference positions (including indices, portfolio 
coverage and other reference points) as well as protection 
purchased by CIB through credit-related notes primarily in 
its market-making businesses. In addition, the Firm obtains 
credit protection against certain loans in the retained 
consumer portfolio through the issuance of credit-related 
notes. Since these credit-related notes are not part of the 
market-making businesses they are not included in the 
table below. 
Notes to consolidated financial statements

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, 
because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value 
of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the 
risks associated with such derivatives.

as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, where JPMorgan Chase is the seller of protection. The maturity profile is based on the 
remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts. The ratings profile is based on the rating of the reference 
entity on which the credit derivative contract is based. The ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives where JPMorgan 
Chase is the purchaser of protection are comparable to the profile reflected below.

Note 6 – Noninterest revenue and noninterest expense
Noninterest revenue
The Firm records noninterest revenue from certain 
contracts with customers in investment banking fees, 
deposit-related fees, asset management, administration, 
and commissions, and components of card income. The 
related contracts are often terminable on demand and the 
Firm has no remaining obligation to deliver future services. 
For arrangements with a fixed term, the Firm may commit 
to deliver services in the future. Revenue associated with 
these remaining performance obligations typically depends 
on the occurrence of future events or underlying asset 
values, and is not recognized until the outcome of those 
events or values are known.
Investment banking fees 
This revenue category includes debt and equity 
underwriting and advisory fees. As an underwriter, the Firm 
helps clients raise capital via public offering and private 
placement of various types of debt and equity instruments. 
Underwriting fees are primarily based on the issuance price 
and quantity of the underlying instruments, and are 
recognized as revenue typically upon execution of the 
client’s transaction. The Firm also manages and syndicates 
loan arrangements. Credit arrangement and syndication 
fees, included within debt underwriting fees, are recorded 
as revenue after satisfying certain retention, timing and 
yield criteria. 
The Firm also provides advisory services, by assisting its 
clients with mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, 
restructuring and other complex transactions. Advisory fees 
are recognized as revenue typically upon execution of the 
client’s transaction.
The following table presents the components of investment 
banking fees.

Investment banking fees are earned primarily by CIB. Refer 
to Note 32 for segment results.
Principal transactions 
Principal transactions revenue is driven by many factors, 
including: 
• the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the 
price at which a market participant is willing and able to 
sell an instrument to the Firm and the price at which 
another market participant is willing and able to buy it 
from the Firm, and vice versa; and 
• realized and unrealized gains and losses on financial 
instruments and commodities transactions, including 
those accounted for under the fair value option, primarily 
used in client-driven market-making activities, and on 
private equity investments. 
– Realized gains and losses result from the sale of 
instruments, closing out or termination of transactions, 
or interim cash payments. 
– Unrealized gains and losses result from changes in 
valuation. 
In connection with its client-driven market-making 
activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity 
instruments, derivatives and commodities, including 
physical commodities inventories and financial instruments 
that reference commodities. 
Principal transactions revenue also includes realized and 
unrealized gains and losses related to: 
• derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting 
relationships, primarily fair value hedges of commodity 
and foreign exchange risk; 
• derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, 
primarily to mitigate credit, foreign exchange and 
interest rate risks.
Refer to Note 5 for further information on the income 
statement classification of gains and losses from derivatives 
activities. 
In the financial commodity markets, the Firm transacts in 
OTC derivatives (e.g., swaps, forwards, options) and ETD 
that reference a wide range of underlying commodities. In 
the physical commodity markets, the Firm primarily 
purchases and sells precious and base metals and may hold 
other commodities inventories under financing and other 
arrangements with clients. 
The following table presents all realized and unrealized 
gains and losses recorded in principal transactions revenue. 
This table excludes interest income and interest expense on 
trading assets and liabilities, which are an integral part of 
the overall performance of the Firm’s client-driven marketmaking activities in CIB and fund deployment activities in 
Treasury and CIO. Refer to Note 7 for further information 
on interest income and interest expense. 
Trading revenue is presented primarily by instrument type. 
The Firm’s client-driven market-making businesses 
generally utilize a variety of instrument types in connection 
with their market-making and related risk-management 
activities; accordingly, the trading revenue presented in the 
table below is not representative of the total revenue of any 
individual LOB.

Lending-related fees include fees earned from loan 
commitments, standby letters of credit, financial 
guarantees, and other loan-servicing activities. Depositrelated fees include fees earned from providing overdraft 
and other deposit account services, and from performing 
cash management activities. Lending- and deposit-related

Asset management, administration and commissions 
This revenue category includes fees from investment 
management and related services, custody, brokerage 
services and other products. The Firm manages assets on 
behalf of its clients, including investors in Firm-sponsored 
funds and owners of separately managed investment 
accounts. Management fees are typically based on the value 
of assets under management and are collected and 
recognized at the end of each period over which the 
management services are provided and the value of the 
managed assets is known. The Firm also receives 
performance-based management fees, which are earned 
based on exceeding certain benchmarks or other 
performance targets and are accrued and recognized when 
the probability of reversal is remote, typically at the end of 
the related billing period. The Firm has contractual 
arrangements with third parties to provide distribution and 
other services in connection with its asset management 
activities. Amounts paid to these third-party service 
providers are generally recorded in professional and 
outside services expense.

management services, such as commissions earned on the sales or 
distribution of mutual funds to clients. These fees are recorded as 
revenue at the time the service is rendered or, in the case of certain 
distribution fees based on the underlying fund’s asset value and/or 
investor redemption, recorded over time as the investor remains in the 
fund or upon investor redemption.
(c) Predominantly includes fees for custody, securities lending, funds 
services and securities clearance. These fees are recorded as revenue 
over the period in which the related service is provided.
(d) Represents commissions earned when the Firm acts as a broker, by 
facilitating its clients’ purchases and sales of securities and other 
financial instruments. Brokerage commissions are collected and 
recognized as revenue upon occurrence of the client transaction. The 
Firm reports certain costs paid to third-party clearing houses and 
exchanges net against commission revenue.
(e) Includes travel-related and annuity sales commissions, depositary 
receipt-related service fees, as well as other service fees, which are 
recognized as revenue when the services are rendered.
Asset management, administration and commissions are 
earned primarily by AWM, CIB and CCB. Refer to Note 32 for 
segment results.
Mortgage fees and related income
This revenue category reflects CCB’s Home Lending 
production and net mortgage servicing revenue. 
Production revenue includes fees and income recognized as 
earned on mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell, 
and the impact of risk management activities associated 
with the mortgage pipeline and warehouse loans. 
Production revenue also includes gains and losses on sales 
and lower of cost or fair value adjustments on mortgage 
loans held-for-sale (excluding certain repurchased loans 
insured by U.S. government agencies), and changes in the 
fair value of financial instruments measured under the fair 
value option. Net mortgage servicing revenue includes 
operating revenue earned from servicing third-party 
mortgage loans, which is recognized over the period in 
which the service is provided; changes in the fair value of 
MSRs; the impact of risk management activities associated 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

with MSRs; and gains and losses on securitization of excess 
mortgage servicing. Net mortgage servicing revenue also 
includes gains and losses on sales and lower of cost or fair 
value adjustments of certain repurchased loans insured by 
U.S. government agencies. 
Refer to Note 15 for further information on risk 
management activities and MSRs. 
Net interest income from mortgage loans is recorded in 
interest income. 
Card income
This revenue category includes interchange and other 
income from credit and debit card transactions; and fees 
earned from processing card transactions for merchants, 
both of which are recognized when purchases are made by 
a cardholder and presented net of certain transactionrelated costs. Card income also includes account origination 
costs and annual fees, which are deferred and recognized 
on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period.
Certain credit card products offer the cardholder the ability 
to earn points based on account activity, which the 
cardholder can choose to redeem for cash and non-cash 
rewards. The cost to the Firm related to these proprietary 
rewards programs varies based on multiple factors 
including the terms and conditions of the rewards 
programs, cardholder activity, cardholder reward 
redemption rates and cardholder reward selections. The 
Firm maintains a liability for its obligations under its 
rewards programs and reports the current-period cost as a 
reduction of card income. 
Credit card revenue sharing agreements 
The Firm has contractual agreements with numerous cobrand partners that grant the Firm exclusive rights to issue 
co-branded credit card products and market them to the 
customers of such partners. These partners endorse the cobrand credit card programs and provide their customer or 
member lists to the Firm. The partners may also conduct 
marketing activities and provide rewards redeemable under 
their own loyalty programs that the Firm will grant to cobrand credit cardholders based on account activity. The 
terms of these agreements generally range from five to ten 
years.
The Firm typically makes payments to the co-brand credit 
card partners based on the cost of partners’ marketing 
activities and loyalty program rewards provided to credit 
cardholders, new account originations and sales volumes. 
Payments to partners based on marketing efforts 
undertaken by the partners are expensed by the Firm as 
incurred and reported as marketing expense. Payments for 
partner loyalty program rewards are reported as a 
reduction of card income when incurred. Payments to 
partners based on new credit card account originations are 
accounted for as direct loan origination costs and are 
deferred and recognized as a reduction of card income on a 
straight-line basis over a 12-month period. Payments to 
partners based on sales volumes are reported as a 
reduction of card income when the related interchange 
income is earned.

instruments containing embedded derivatives that would be 
separately accounted for in accordance with U.S. GAAP, 
absent the fair value option election; for those instruments, 
all changes in fair value including any interest elements, are 
primarily reported in principal transactions revenue. For 
financial instruments that are not measured at fair value, 
the related interest is included within interest income or 
interest expense, as applicable. Refer to Notes 12, 10, 11 
and 20 for further information on accounting for interest 
income and interest expense related to loans, investment 
securities, securities financing activities (i.e., securities 
purchased or sold under resale or repurchase agreements; 
securities borrowed; and securities loaned) and long-term 
debt, respectively.

Note 8 – Pension and other postretirement 
employee benefit plans 
The Firm has various defined benefit pension plans and 
OPEB plans that provide benefits to its employees in the 
U.S. and certain non-U.S. locations. Substantially all the 
defined benefit pension plans are closed to new 
participants. The principal defined benefit pension plan in 
the U.S., which covered substantially all U.S. employees, 
was closed to new participants and frozen for existing 
participants on January 1, 2020, (and January 1, 2019 for 
new hires on or after December 2, 2017). Interest credits 
continue to accrue to participants’ accounts based on their 
accumulated balances.
The Firm maintains funded and unfunded postretirement 
benefit plans that provide medical and life insurance for 
certain eligible employees and retirees as well as their 
dependents covered under these programs. None of these 
plans have a material impact on the Firm’s Consolidated 
Financial Statements. 
The Firm also provides a qualified defined contribution plan 
in the U.S. and maintains other similar arrangements in 
certain non-U.S. locations. The most significant of these 
plans is the JPMorgan Chase 401(k) Savings Plan (“the 
401(k) Savings Plan”), which covers substantially all U.S. 
employees. Employees can contribute to the 401(k) Savings 
Plan on a pretax and/or Roth 401(k) after-tax basis. The 
Firm makes an annual matching contribution as well as an 
annual profit-sharing contribution to the 401(k) Savings 
Plan on behalf of eligible participants. 
The following table presents the pretax benefit obligations, plan assets, the net funded status, and the amounts recorded in 
AOCI on the Consolidated balance sheets for the Firm’s significant defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.

The weighted-average discount rate used to value the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, was 5.14% and 
2.54%, respectively.
Gains and losses
Gains or losses resulting from changes in the benefit 
obligation and the fair value of plan assets are recorded in 
OCI. Amortization of net gains or losses are recognized as 
part of the net periodic benefit cost over subsequent 
periods, if, as of the beginning of the year, the net gain or 
loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit 
obligation or the fair value of the plan assets. Amortization 
is generally over the average expected remaining lifetime of 
plan participants, given the frozen status of most plans. 
During the year ended December 31, 2022, a 
remeasurement of the Firm’s U.S. principal defined benefit 
plan in the third quarter, was required as a result of a 
pension settlement. The remeasurement resulted in a 
reduction in the fair value of the Firm’s U.S. principal 
defined benefit plan assets, reflecting market conditions at 
the time of remeasurement, and a reduction in the plan’s 
projected benefit obligation totaling $4.0 billion and $2.6 
billion, respectively, resulting in a net decrease of $1.4 
billion in pre-tax AOCI. For the year ended December 31, 
2021, the net gain was predominantly attributable to 
market-driven increases in the fair value of plan assets and 
the discount rate.
The following table presents the net periodic benefit costs reported in the Consolidated statements of income for the Firm’s

Plan assumptions
The Firm’s expected long-term rate of return is a blended 
weighted average, by asset allocation of the projected longterm returns for the various asset classes, taking into 
consideration local market conditions and the specific 
allocation of plan assets. Returns on asset classes are 
developed using a forward-looking approach and are not 
strictly based on historical returns, with consideration given 
to current market conditions and the portfolio mix of each 
plan. 
The discount rates used in determining the benefit 
obligations are generally provided by the Firm’s actuaries, 
with the Firm’s principal defined benefit pension plan using 
a rate that was selected by reference to the yields on 
portfolios of bonds with maturity dates and coupons that 
closely match each of the plan’s projected cash flows. 
Investment strategy and asset allocation
The assets of the Firm’s defined benefit pension plans are 
held in various trusts and are invested in well-diversified 
portfolios of equity and fixed income securities, cash and 
cash equivalents, and alternative investments. The Firm 
regularly reviews the asset allocations and asset managers, 
as well as other factors that could impact the portfolios, 
which are rebalanced when deemed necessary. The 
approved asset allocation ranges by asset class for the 
Firm’s principal defined benefit plan are 42-100% debt 
securities, 0-40% equity securities, 0-3% real estate, and 
0-12% alternatives as of December 31, 2022.
As of December 31, 2022, assets held by the Firm’s defined 
benefit pension and OPEB plans do not include securities 
issued by JPMorgan Chase or its affiliates, except through 
indirect exposures through investments in exchange traded 
funds, mutual funds and collective investment funds 
managed by third-parties. The defined benefit pension and 
OPEB plans hold investments that are sponsored or 
managed by affiliates of JPMorgan Chase in the amount of 
$1.7 billion and $2.5 billion, as of December 31, 2022 and 
2021, respectively.

Note 9 – Employee share-based incentives
Employee share-based awards
In 2022, 2021 and 2020, JPMorgan Chase granted longterm share-based awards to certain employees under its 
LTIP, as amended and restated effective May 15, 2018, and 
subsequently amended effective May 18, 2021. Under the 
terms of the LTIP, as of December 31, 2022, 69 million 
shares of common stock were available for issuance 
through May 2025. The LTIP is the only active plan under 
which the Firm is currently granting share-based incentive 
awards. In the following discussion, the LTIP, plus prior Firm 
plans and plans assumed as the result of acquisitions, are 
referred to collectively as the “LTI Plans,” and such plans 
constitute the Firm’s share-based incentive plans. 
RSUs are awarded at no cost to the recipient upon their 
grant. Generally, RSUs are granted annually and vest at a 
rate of 50% after two years and 50% after three years and 
are converted into shares of common stock as of the vesting 
date. In addition, RSUs typically include full-career eligibility 
provisions, which allow employees to continue to vest upon 
voluntary termination based on age and/or service-related 
requirements, subject to post-employment and other 
restrictions. All RSU awards are subject to forfeiture until 
vested and contain clawback provisions that may result in 
cancellation under certain specified circumstances. 
Predominantly all RSUs entitle the recipient to receive cash 
payments equivalent to any dividends paid on the 
underlying common stock during the period the RSUs are 
outstanding. 
Performance share units (“PSUs”) are granted annually, 
and approved by the Firm’s Board of Directors, to members 
of the Firm’s Operating Committee under the variable 
compensation program. PSUs are subject to the Firm’s 
achievement of specified performance criteria over a threeyear period. The number of awards that vest can range 
from zero to 150% of the grant amount. In addition, 
dividends that accrue during the vesting period are 
reinvested in dividend equivalent share units. PSUs and the 
related dividend equivalent share units are converted into 
shares of common stock after vesting.
Once the PSUs and dividend equivalent share units have 
vested, the shares of common stock that are delivered, after 
applicable tax withholding, must be retained for an 
additional holding period, for a total combined vesting and 
holding period of approximately five to eight years from the 
grant date depending on regulations in certain countries. 
Under the LTI Plans, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) and 
stock options have generally been granted with an exercise 
price equal to the fair value of JPMorgan Chase’s common 
stock on the grant date. SARs and stock options generally 
expire ten years after the grant date. In 2021, the Firm 
awarded its Chairman and CEO and its President and Chief 
Operating Officer 1.5 million and 750,000 SARs, 
respectively. There were no grants of SARs or stock options 
in 2022 and grants in 2020 were not material. 
The Firm separately recognizes compensation expense for 
each tranche of each award, net of estimated forfeitures, as 
if it were a separate award with its own vesting date. 
Generally, for each tranche granted, compensation expense 
is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date 
until the vesting date of the respective tranche, provided 
that the employees will not become full-career eligible 
during the vesting period. For awards with full-career 
eligibility provisions and awards granted with no future 
substantive service requirement, the Firm accrues the 
estimated value of awards expected to be awarded to 
employees as of the grant date without giving consideration 
to the impact of post-employment restrictions. For each 
tranche granted to employees who will become full-career 
eligible during the vesting period, compensation expense is 
recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until 
the earlier of the employee’s full-career eligibility date or 
the vesting date of the respective tranche. 
The Firm’s policy for issuing shares upon settlement of 
employee share-based incentive awards is to issue either 
new shares of common stock or treasury shares. During 
2022, 2021 and 2020, the Firm settled all of its employee 
share-based awards by issuing treasury shares. 
Refer to Note 23 for further information on the 
classification of share-based awards for purposes of 
calculating earnings per share.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

RSUs, PSUs, SARs and stock options activity 
Generally, compensation expense for RSUs and PSUs is measured based on the number of units granted multiplied by the stock 
price at the grant date, and for SARs and stock options, is measured at the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model. 
Compensation expense for these awards is recognized in net income as described previously. The following table summarizes 
JPMorgan Chase’s RSUs, PSUs, SARs and stock options activity for 2022.

awards had not yet been charged to net income. That cost is 
expected to be amortized into compensation expense over a 
weighted-average period of 1.8 years. The Firm does not 
capitalize any compensation expense related to sharebased compensation awards to employees. 
Tax benefits
Income tax benefits (including tax benefits from dividends 
or dividend equivalents) related to share-based incentive 
arrangements recognized in the Firm’s Consolidated 
statements of income for the years ended December 31, 
2022, 2021 and 2020, were $901 million, $957 million 
and $837 million, respectively.

Note 10 – Investment securities 
Investment securities consist of debt securities that are 
classified as AFS or HTM. Debt securities classified as 
trading assets are discussed in Note 2. Predominantly all of 
the Firm’s AFS and HTM securities are held by Treasury and 
CIO in connection with its asset-liability management 
activities.
AFS securities are carried at fair value on the Consolidated 
balance sheets. Unrealized gains and losses, after any 
applicable hedge accounting adjustments or allowance for 
credit losses, are reported in AOCI. The specific 
identification method is used to determine realized gains 
and losses on AFS securities, which are included in 
investment securities gains/(losses) on the Consolidated 
statements of income. HTM securities, which the Firm has 
the intent and ability to hold until maturity, are carried at 
amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses, on the 
Consolidated balance sheets.
For both AFS and HTM securities, purchase discounts or 
premiums are generally amortized into interest income on a 
level-yield basis over the contractual life of the security. 
However, premiums on certain callable debt securities are 
amortized to the earliest call date. 
During 2022 and 2021, the Firm transferred $78.3 billion 
and $104.5 billion of investment securities, respectively, 
from AFS to HTM for capital management purposes. AOCI 
included pretax unrealized gains/(losses) of $(4.8) billion 
and $425 million, respectively, on the securities at the 
dates of transfer.
Unrealized gains or losses at the date of transfer of these 
securities continue to be reported in AOCI and are amortized 
into interest income on a level-yield basis over the 
remaining life of the securities. This amortization will offset 
the effect on interest income of the amortization of the 
premium or discount resulting from the transfer recorded at 
fair value. 
Transfers of securities from AFS to HTM are non-cash 
transactions and are recorded at fair value.

(c) Excludes $2.5 billion and $1.9 billion of accrued interest receivable at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, included in accrued interest and 
accounts receivable on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm generally does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest 
receivable, consistent with its policy to write them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income. The Firm did not reverse through 
interest income any accrued interest receivable for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
At December 31, 2022, the investment securities portfolio 
consisted of debt securities with an average credit rating of 
AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, and 
where not available, based primarily upon internal risk 
ratings). Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality 
of securities and differentiate risk within the portfolio. The 
Firm’s internal risk ratings generally align with the 
qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet 
financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the 
economic environment) defined by S&P and Moody’s, 
however the quantitative characteristics (e.g., probability of 
default (“PD”) and loss given default (“LGD”)) may differ as 
they reflect internal historical experiences and 
assumptions. Risk ratings are assigned at acquisition, 
reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk 
Management and adjusted as necessary over the life of the 
investment for updated information affecting the issuer’s 
ability to fulfill its obligations.

MBS with unrealized losses of $9.6 billion and $2.2 billion, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively; changes in the 
value of these securities are generally driven by changes in interest rates rather than changes in their credit profile given the 
explicit or implicit guarantees provided by the U.S. government.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

AFS securities are considered impaired if the fair value is 
less than the amortized cost. 
The Firm recognizes impairment losses in earnings if the 
Firm has the intent to sell the debt security, or if it is more 
likely than not that the Firm will be required to sell the debt 
security before recovery of its amortized cost. In these 
circumstances the impairment loss is recognized in 
investment securities gains/(losses) in the Consolidated 
Statements of Income and is equal to the full difference 
between the amortized cost (net of allowance if applicable) 
and the fair value of the security. 
For impaired debt securities that the Firm has the intent 
and ability to hold, the securities are evaluated to 
determine if a credit loss exists. If it is determined that a 
credit loss exists, that loss is recognized as an allowance for 
credit losses through the provision for credit losses in the 
Consolidated Statements of Income, limited by the amount 
of impairment. Any impairment on debt securities that the 
Firm has the intent and ability to hold not due to credit 
losses is recorded in OCI. 
Factors considered in evaluating credit losses include 
adverse conditions specifically related to the industry, 
geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or 
underlying collateral of a security; and payment structure of 
the security. 
When assessing securities issued in a securitization for 
credit losses, the Firm estimates cash flows considering 
relevant market and economic data, underlying loan-level 
data, and structural features of the securitization, such as 
subordination, excess spread, overcollateralization or other 
forms of credit enhancement, and compares the losses 
projected for the underlying collateral (“pool losses”) 
against the level of credit enhancement in the securitization 
structure to determine whether these features are sufficient 
to absorb the pool losses, or whether a credit loss exists. 
For beneficial interests in securitizations that are rated 
below “AA” at their acquisition, or that can be contractually 
prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the Firm 
would not recover substantially all of its recorded 
investment, the Firm evaluates impairment for credit losses 
when there is an adverse change in expected cash flows. 
HTM securities – credit risk
Allowance for credit losses
The allowance for credit losses represents expected credit 
losses over the remaining expected life of HTM securities.
The allowance for credit losses on HTM obligations of U.S. 
states and municipalities and commercial mortgage-backed 
securities is calculated by applying statistical credit loss 
factors (estimated PD and LGD) to the amortized cost. The 
credit loss factors are derived using a weighted average of 
five internally developed eight-quarter macroeconomic 
scenarios, followed by a single year straight-line 
interpolation to revert to long run historical information for 
periods beyond the forecast period. Refer to Note 13 for 
further information on the eight-quarter macroeconomic 
forecast. 
The allowance for credit losses on HTM collateralized loan 
obligations and U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities
is calculated as the difference between the amortized cost 
and the present value of the cash flows expected to be 
collected, discounted at the security’s effective interest 
rate. These cash flow estimates are developed based on 
expectations of underlying collateral performance derived 
using the eight-quarter macroeconomic forecast and the 
single year straight-line interpolation, as well as considering 
the structural features of the security. 
The application of different inputs and assumptions into the 
calculation of the allowance for credit losses is subject to 
significant management judgment, and emphasizing one 
input or assumption over another, or considering other 
inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of the 
allowance for credit losses on HTM securities. 
Credit quality indicator
The primary credit quality indicator for HTM securities is the 
risk rating assigned to each security. At both December 31, 
2022 and 2021, all HTM securities were rated investment 
grade and were current and accruing, with approximately 
98% rated at least AA+. 
Allowance for credit losses on investment securities
The allowance for credit losses on investment securities was 
$96 million, $42 million and $78 million as of 
December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

(a) Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted based on the amortized cost of each security. 
The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. 
Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual 
maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt 
securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date.
(b) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. The 
estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately eight years for agency residential MBS, and six years for 
both agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations and nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Note 11 – Securities financing activities
JPMorgan Chase enters into resale, repurchase, securities 
borrowed and securities loaned agreements (collectively, 
“securities financing agreements”) primarily to finance the 
Firm’s inventory positions, acquire securities to cover short 
sales, accommodate customers’ financing needs, settle 
other securities obligations and to deploy the Firm’s excess 
cash. 
Securities financing agreements are treated as 
collateralized financings on the Firm’s Consolidated balance 
sheets. Where appropriate under applicable accounting 
guidance, securities financing agreements with the same 
counterparty are reported on a net basis. Refer to Note 1 
for further discussion of the offsetting of assets and 
liabilities. Fees received and paid in connection with 
securities financing agreements are recorded over the life 
of the agreement in interest income and interest expense 
on the Consolidated statements of income. 
The Firm has elected the fair value option for certain 
securities financing agreements. Refer to Note 3 for further 
information regarding the fair value option. The securities 
financing agreements for which the fair value option has 
been elected are reported within securities purchased 
under resale agreements, securities loaned or sold under 
repurchase agreements, and securities borrowed on the 
Consolidated balance sheets. Generally, for agreements 
carried at fair value, current-period interest accruals are 
recorded within interest income and interest expense, with 
changes in fair value reported in principal transactions 
revenue. However, for financial instruments containing 
embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted 
for in accordance with accounting guidance for hybrid 
instruments, all changes in fair value, including any interest 
elements, are reported in principal transactions revenue. 
Securities financing agreements not elected under the fair 
value option are measured at amortized cost. As a result of 
the Firm’s credit risk mitigation practices described below, 
the Firm did not hold any allowance for credit losses with 
respect to resale and securities borrowed arrangements as 
of December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Credit risk mitigation practices
Securities financing agreements expose the Firm primarily 
to credit and liquidity risk. To manage these risks, the Firm 
monitors the value of the underlying securities 
(predominantly high-quality securities collateral, including 
government-issued debt and U.S. GSEs and government 
agencies MBS) that it has received from or provided to its 
counterparties compared to the value of cash proceeds and 
exchanged collateral, and either requests additional 
collateral or returns securities or collateral when 
appropriate. Margin levels are initially established based 
upon the counterparty, the type of underlying securities, 
and the permissible collateral, and are monitored on an 
ongoing basis. 
In resale and securities borrowed agreements, the Firm is 
exposed to credit risk to the extent that the value of the 
securities received is less than initial cash principal 
advanced and any collateral amounts exchanged. In 
repurchase and securities loaned agreements, credit risk 
exposure arises to the extent that the value of underlying 
securities advanced exceeds the value of the initial cash 
principal received, and any collateral amounts exchanged. 
Additionally, the Firm typically enters into master netting 
agreements and other similar arrangements with its 
counterparties, which provide for the right to liquidate the 
underlying securities and any collateral amounts exchanged 
in the event of a counterparty default. It is also the Firm’s 
policy to take possession, where possible, of the securities 
underlying resale and securities borrowed agreements. 
Refer to Note 29 for further information regarding assets 
pledged and collateral received in securities financing 
agreements.
Notes to consolidated financial statements

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of 
the Firm’s securities financing agreements, as of 
December 31, 2022 and 2021. When the Firm has obtained 
an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master 
netting agreement with a counterparty and where other 
relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm 
nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances 
outstanding under its securities financing agreements with 
the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges 
securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to 
reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but 
such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance 
sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an 
appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty 
master netting agreement, such collateral, along with 
securities financing balances that do not meet all these 
relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in 
the table below as “Amounts not nettable on the 
Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net 
amounts” presented. Where a legal opinion has not been 
either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances 
are presented gross in the “Net amounts” below. In 
transactions where the Firm is acting as the lender in a 
securities-for-securities lending agreement and receives 
securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral, the Firm 
recognizes the securities received at fair value within other 
assets and the obligation to return those securities within 
accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated 
balance sheets.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Note 12 – Loans
Loan accounting framework
The accounting for a loan depends on management’s 
strategy for the loan. The Firm accounts for loans based on 
the following categories:
Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., 
“retained”)
Loans held-for-sale
Loans at fair value
The following provides a detailed accounting discussion of 
the Firm’s loans by category:
Loans held-for-investment
Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment, 
including PCD, are recorded at amortized cost, reflecting 
the principal amount outstanding, net of the following: 
unamortized deferred loan fees, costs, premiums or 
discounts; charge-offs; collection of cash; and foreign 
exchange. Credit card loans also include billed finance 
charges and fees.
Interest income
Interest income on performing loans held-for-investment is 
accrued and recognized as interest income at the 
contractual rate of interest. Purchase price discounts or 
premiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs, are 
amortized into interest income over the contractual life of 
the loan as an adjustment of yield.
The Firm classifies accrued interest on loans, including 
accrued but unbilled interest on credit card loans, in 
accrued interest and accounts receivables on the 
Consolidated balance sheets. For credit card loans, accrued 
interest once billed is then recognized in the loan balances, 
with the related allowance recorded in the allowance for 
credit losses. Changes in the allowance for credit losses on 
accrued interest on credit card loans are recognized in the 
provision for credit losses and charge-offs are recognized 
by reversing interest income. For other loans, the Firm 
generally does not recognize an allowance for credit losses 
on accrued interest receivables, consistent with its policy to 
write them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing 
interest income. 
Nonaccrual loans 
Nonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest 
has been suspended. Loans (other than credit card loans 
and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government 
agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status and considered 
nonperforming when full payment of principal and interest 
is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when 
principal and interest has been in default for a period of 90 
days or more, unless the loan is both well-secured and in 
the process of collection. A loan is determined to be past 
due when the minimum payment is not received from the 
borrower by the contractually specified due date or for 
certain loans (e.g., residential real estate loans), when a 
monthly payment is due and unpaid for 30 days or more. 
Finally, collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained 
on nonaccrual status. 
On the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all 
interest accrued but not collected is reversed against 
interest income. In addition, the amortization of deferred 
amounts is suspended. Interest income on nonaccrual loans 
may be recognized as cash interest payments are received 
(i.e., on a cash basis) if the recorded loan balance is 
deemed fully collectible; however, if there is doubt 
regarding the ultimate collectibility of the recorded loan 
balance, all interest cash receipts are applied to reduce the 
carrying value of the loan (the cost recovery method). For 
consumer loans, application of this policy typically results in 
the Firm recognizing interest income on nonaccrual 
consumer loans on a cash basis.
A loan may be returned to accrual status when repayment is 
reasonably assured and there has been demonstrated 
performance under the terms of the loan or, if applicable, 
the terms of the restructured loan. 
As permitted by regulatory guidance, credit card loans are 
generally exempt from being placed on nonaccrual status; 
accordingly, interest and fees related to credit card loans 
continue to accrue until the loan is charged off or paid in 
full. 
Allowance for loan losses 
The allowance for loan losses represents the estimated 
expected credit losses in the held-for-investment loan 
portfolio at the balance sheet date and is recognized on the 
balance sheet as a contra asset, which brings the amortized 
cost to the net carrying value. Changes in the allowance for 
loan losses are recorded in the provision for credit losses on 
the Firm’s Consolidated statements of income. Refer to 
Note 13 for further information on the Firm’s accounting 
policies for the allowance for loan losses. 
Charge-offs 
Consumer loans are generally charged off or charged down 
to the lower of the amortized cost or the net realizable 
value of the underlying collateral (i.e., fair value less 
estimated costs to sell), with an offset to the allowance for 
loan losses, upon reaching specified stages of delinquency 
in accordance with standards established by the FFIEC. 
Residential real estate loans, unmodified credit card loans 
and scored business banking loans are generally charged 
off no later than 180 days past due. Scored auto and 
modified credit card loans are charged off no later than 120 
days past due. 
Certain consumer loans are charged off or charged down to 
their net realizable value earlier than the FFIEC charge-off 
standards in the following circumstances: 
Loans modified in a TDR that are determined to be 
collateral-dependent. 
Loans to borrowers who have experienced an event that 
suggests a loss is either known or highly certain are 
subject to accelerated charge-off standards (e.g., 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

residential real estate and auto loans are charged off or 
charged down within 60 days of receiving notification of 
a bankruptcy filing). 
Auto loans upon repossession of the automobile. 
Other than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm 
typically does not recognize charge-offs on the governmentguaranteed portion of loans. 
Wholesale loans are charged off when it is highly certain 
that a loss has been realized. The determination of whether 
to recognize a charge-off includes many factors, including 
the prioritization of the Firm’s claim in bankruptcy, 
expectations of the workout/restructuring of the loan and 
valuation of the borrower’s equity or the loan collateral. 
When a loan is charged down to the lower of its amortized 
cost or the estimated net realizable value of the underlying 
collateral, the determination of the fair value of the 
collateral depends on the type of collateral (e.g., securities, 
real estate). In cases where the collateral is in the form of 
liquid securities, the fair value is based on quoted market 
prices or broker quotes. For illiquid securities or other 
financial assets, the fair value of the collateral is generally 
estimated using a discounted cash flow model. 
For residential real estate loans, collateral values are based 
upon external valuation sources. When it becomes likely 
that a borrower is either unable or unwilling to pay, the 
Firm utilizes a broker’s price opinion, appraisal and/or an 
automated valuation model of the home based on an 
exterior-only valuation (“exterior opinions”), which is then 
updated at least every 12 months, or more frequently 
depending on various market factors. As soon as practicable 
after the Firm receives the property in satisfaction of a debt 
(e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession), the Firm 
generally obtains an appraisal based on an inspection that 
includes the interior of the home (“interior appraisals”). 
Exterior opinions and interior appraisals are discounted 
based upon the Firm’s experience with actual liquidation 
values as compared with the estimated values provided by 
exterior opinions and interior appraisals, considering statespecific factors. 
For commercial real estate loans, collateral values are 
generally based on appraisals from internal and external 
valuation sources. Collateral values are typically updated 
every six to twelve months, either by obtaining a new 
appraisal or by performing an internal analysis, in 
accordance with the Firm’s policies. The Firm also considers 
both borrower- and market-specific factors, which may 
result in obtaining appraisal updates or broker price 
opinions at more frequent intervals.
Loans held-for-sale 
Loans held-for-sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair 
value, with valuation changes recorded in noninterest 
revenue. For consumer loans, the valuation is performed on 
a portfolio basis. For wholesale loans, the valuation is 
performed on an individual loan basis. 
Interest income on loans held-for-sale is accrued and 
recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. 
Loan origination fees or costs and purchase price discounts 
or premiums are deferred in a contra loan account until the 
related loan is sold. The deferred fees or costs and 
discounts or premiums are an adjustment to the basis of the 
loan and therefore are included in the periodic 
determination of the lower of cost or fair value adjustments 
and/or the gain or loss recognized at the time of sale. 
Because these loans are recognized at the lower of cost or 
fair value, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses and chargeoff policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans 
held-for-sale are subject to the nonaccrual policies 
described above. 
Loans at fair value 
Loans for which the fair value option has been elected are 
measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded 
in noninterest revenue. 
Interest income on these loans is accrued and recognized 
based on the contractual rate of interest. Changes in fair 
value are recognized in noninterest revenue. Loan 
origination fees are recognized upfront in noninterest 
revenue. Loan origination costs are recognized in the 
associated expense category as incurred. 
Because these loans are recognized at fair value, the Firm’s 
allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not 
apply to these loans. However, loans at fair value are 
subject to the nonaccrual policies described above. 
Refer to Note 3 for further information on the Firm’s 
elections of fair value accounting under the fair value 
option. Refer to Note 2 and Note 3 for further information 
on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading 
assets.

Loan classification changes 
Loans in the held-for-investment portfolio that 
management decides to sell are transferred to the held-forsale portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value on the date 
of transfer. Credit-related losses are charged against the 
allowance for loan losses; non-credit related losses such as 
those due to changes in interest rates or foreign currency 
exchange rates are recognized in noninterest revenue. 
In the event that management decides to retain a loan in 
the held-for-sale portfolio, the loan is transferred to the 
held-for-investment portfolio at amortized cost on the date 
of transfer. These loans are subsequently assessed for 
impairment based on the Firm’s allowance methodology. 
Refer to Note 13 for a further discussion of the 
methodologies used in establishing the Firm’s allowance for 
loan losses. 
Loan modifications 
The Firm seeks to modify certain loans in conjunction with 
its loss mitigation activities. Through the modification, 
JPMorgan Chase grants one or more concessions to a 
borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty in order to 
minimize the Firm’s economic loss and avoid foreclosure or 
repossession of the collateral, and to ultimately maximize 
payments received by the Firm from the borrower. The 
concessions granted vary by program and by borrowerspecific characteristics, and may include interest rate 
reductions, term extensions, payment delays, principal 
forgiveness, or the acceptance of equity or other assets in 
lieu of payments. Such modifications are accounted for and 
reported as TDRs. Loans with short-term and other 
insignificant modifications that are not considered 
concessions are not TDRs. 
Loans, except for credit card loans, modified in a TDR are 
generally placed on nonaccrual status, although in many 
cases such loans were already on nonaccrual status prior to 
modification. These loans may be returned to performing 
status (the accrual of interest is resumed) if the following 
criteria are met: (i) the borrower has performed under the 
modified terms for a minimum of six months and/or six 
payments, and (ii) the Firm has an expectation that 
repayment of the modified loan is reasonably assured based 
on, for example, the borrower’s debt capacity and level of 
future earnings, collateral values, LTV ratios, and other 
current market considerations. In certain limited and welldefined circumstances in which the loan is current at the 
modification date, such loans are not placed on nonaccrual 
status at the time of modification. 
Loans modified in TDRs are generally measured for 
impairment using the Firm’s established asset-specific 
allowance methodology, which considers the expected redefault rates for the modified loans. A loan modified in a 
TDR generally remains subject to the asset-specific 
component of the allowance throughout its remaining life, 
regardless of whether the loan is performing and has been 
returned to accrual status. Refer to Note 13 for further 
discussion of the methodology used to estimate the Firm’s 
asset-specific allowance. 
Foreclosed property 
The Firm acquires property from borrowers through loan 
restructurings, workouts, and foreclosures. Property 
acquired may include real property (e.g., residential real 
estate, land, and buildings) and commercial and personal 
property (e.g., automobiles, aircraft, railcars, and ships). 
The Firm recognizes foreclosed property upon receiving 
assets in satisfaction of a loan (e.g., by taking legal title or 
physical possession). For loans collateralized by real 
property, the Firm generally recognizes the asset received 
at foreclosure sale or upon the execution of a deed in lieu of 
foreclosure transaction with the borrower. Foreclosed 
assets are reported in other assets on the Consolidated 
balance sheets and initially recognized at fair value less 
estimated costs to sell. Each quarter the fair value of the 
acquired property is reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, to 
the lower of cost or fair value. Subsequent adjustments to 
fair value are charged/credited to noninterest revenue. 
Operating expense, such as real estate taxes and 
maintenance, are charged to other expense.

Loan portfolio 
The Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine 
the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment the 
Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class. 
Consumer, excluding

(b) Includes scored auto and business banking loans and overdrafts.
(c) Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM, Corporate, as well as risk-rated BWM and auto dealer loans held in CCB, for which the wholesale methodology is 
applied when determining the allowance for loan losses.
(d) The wholesale portfolio segment's classes align with loan classifications as defined by the bank regulatory agencies, based on the loan's collateral, 
purpose, and type of borrower.
(e) Includes loans to financial institutions, states and political subdivisions, SPEs, nonprofits, personal investment companies and trusts, as well as loans to 
individuals and individual entities (predominantly Global Private Bank clients within AWM and J.P. Morgan Wealth Management within CCB). Refer to Note

Gains and losses on sales of loans
Net gains/(losses) on sales of loans and lending-related commitments (including adjustments to record loans and lendingrelated commitments held-for-sale at the lower of cost or fair value) recognized in noninterest revenue was $(186) million for 
the year ended December 31, 2022 of which $(48) million was related to loans. Net gains/(losses) on sales of loans and 
lending-related commitments was $261 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 of which $253 million was related to 
loans. Net losses on sales of loans was $(36) million for the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, the sale of loans may 
also result in write downs, recoveries or changes in the allowance recognized in the provision for credit losses.

Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolio
Consumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist 
primarily of scored residential mortgages, home equity 
loans and lines of credit, auto and business banking loans, 
with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market. 
The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by 
junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only 
payment period, and certain payment-option loans that may 
result in negative amortization. 
The following table provides information about retained 
consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class.

Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator 
for consumer loans. Loans that are more than 30 days past 
due provide an early warning of borrowers who may be 
experiencing financial difficulties and/or who may be 
unable or unwilling to repay the loan. As the loan continues 
to age, it becomes more clear whether the borrower is likely 
to be unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of residential 
real estate loans, late-stage delinquencies (greater than 
150 days past due) are a strong indicator of loans that will 
ultimately result in a foreclosure or similar liquidation 
transaction. In addition to delinquency rates, other credit 
quality indicators for consumer loans vary based on the 
class of loan, as follows: 
For residential real estate loans, the current estimated 
LTV ratio, or the combined LTV ratio in the case of junior 
lien loans, is an indicator of the potential loss severity in 
the event of default. Additionally, LTV or combined LTV 
ratios can provide insight into a borrower’s continued 
willingness to pay, as the delinquency rate of high-LTV 
loans tends to be greater than that for loans where the 
borrower has equity in the collateral. The geographic 
distribution of the loan collateral also provides insight as 
to the credit quality of the portfolio, as factors such as 
the regional economy, home price changes and specific 
events such as natural disasters, will affect credit 
quality. The borrower’s current or “refreshed” FICO 
score is a secondary credit quality indicator for certain 
loans, as FICO scores are an indication of the borrower’s 
credit payment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower with a 
low FICO score (less than 660) is considered to be of 
higher risk than a loan to a borrower with a higher FICO 
score. Further, a loan to a borrower with a high LTV 
ratio and a low FICO score is at greater risk of default 
than a loan to a borrower that has both a high LTV ratio 
and a high FICO score.
For scored auto and business banking loans, geographic 
distribution is an indicator of the credit performance of 
the portfolio. Similar to residential real estate loans, 
geographic distribution provides insights into the 
portfolio performance based on regional economic 
activity and events.

(b) At December 31, 2022 and 2021, loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which are still within their 
deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are generally not considered delinquent.
(c) Excludes mortgage loans that are 30 or more days past due insured by U.S. government agencies which were not material at December 31, 2022 and 
2021. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee.
(d) Purchased loans are included in the year in which they were originated.
Approximately 37% of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans. The lien 
position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm’s allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have been converted to 
term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period. That is primarily because the 
fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options available 
for revolving loans within the revolving period.

(a) Includes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged down to the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm 
reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed 
by the borrower (“Chapter 7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency status. At December 31, 2022, 
approximately 5% of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due.
(b) Nonaccrual loans exclude mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies which were not material at December 31, 2022 and 2021.
(c) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered 
collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of 
the underlying collateral improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.
(d) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $175 million and $172 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, 
respectively.
(e) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
(f) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a 
minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the 
extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all 
available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.
(g) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.
(h) Includes residential real estate loans, primarily held in LLCs in AWM that did not have a refreshed FICO score. These loans have been included in a FICO 
band based on management’s estimation of the borrower’s credit quality.
(i) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.

Loan modifications 
Modifications of residential real estate loans, where the 
Firm grants concessions to borrowers who are experiencing 
financial difficulty are generally accounted for and reported 
as TDRs. Loans with short-term or other insignificant 
modifications that are not considered concessions are not 
TDRs. The carrying value of new TDRs was $362 million, 
$866 million and $819 million for the years ended 
December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There 
were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers 
whose residential real estate loans have been modified in 
TDRs.
Nature and extent of modifications
The Firm’s proprietary modification programs as well as 
government programs, including U.S. GSE programs, 
generally provide various concessions to financially 
troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest 
rate reductions, term or payment extensions and delays of 
principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise 
have been required under the terms of the original 
agreement. The following table provides information about 
how residential real estate loans were modified in TDRs 
under the Firm’s loss mitigation programs described above 
during the periods presented. This table excludes Chapter 7 
loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of 
debt and loans with short-term or other insignificant 
modifications that are not considered concessions.

Balance of loans that redefaulted within one year of permanent modification(a)



(a) Represents loans permanently modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred 
within one year of the modification. The dollar amounts presented represent the balance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such 
loans defaulted. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to occur when the loan becomes two contractual payments 
past due. In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it will generally be liquidated through foreclosure or another similar type of liquidation transaction. 
Redefaults of loans modified within the last twelve months may not be representative of ultimate redefault levels.
At December 31, 2022, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans permanently modified 
in TDRs were six years. The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and 
involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).

(a) At December 31, 2022 and 2021, nonaccrual loans excluded $101 
million and $506 million, respectively, of PPP loans 90 or more days 
past due and guaranteed by the SBA, of which $76 million and $35 
million, respectively, were no longer accruing interest based on the 
guidelines set by the SBA. Typically the principal balance of the loans is 
insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate 
subject to meeting the guidelines set by the SBA. There were no loans 
that were not guaranteed by the SBA that are 90 or more days past 
due and still accruing interest at December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
(b) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In 
accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that 
are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the 
lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral 
less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral improves 
subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.
(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was 
not material for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
(d) The geographic regions presented in this table are ordered based on 
the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at December 31, 
2022.
Loan modifications 
Certain auto and other loan modifications are considered 
to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to 
borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Loans 
with short-term or other insignificant modifications that 
are not considered concessions are not TDRs. 
The impact of these modifications, as well as new TDRs, 
were not material to the Firm for the years ended 
December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Additional 
commitments to lend to borrowers whose loans have been 
modified in TDRs as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 
were not material.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Credit card loan portfolio
The credit card portfolio segment includes credit card loans 
originated and purchased by the Firm. Delinquency rates 
are the primary credit quality indicator for credit card loans 
as they provide an early warning that borrowers may be 
experiencing difficulties (30 days past due); information on 
those borrowers that have been delinquent for a longer 
period of time (90 days past due) is also considered. In 
addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of 
the loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the 
portfolio based on the regional economy.
While the borrower’s credit score is another general 
indicator of credit quality, the Firm does not view credit 
scores as a primary indicator of credit quality because the 
borrower’s credit score tends to be a lagging indicator. The 
distribution of such scores provides a general indicator of 
credit quality trends within the portfolio; however, the score 
does not capture all factors that would be predictive of 
future credit performance. Refreshed FICO score 
information, which is obtained at least quarterly, for a 
statistically significant random sample of the credit card 
portfolio is indicated in the following table. FICO is 
considered to be the industry benchmark for credit scores.
The Firm generally originates new credit card accounts to 
prime consumer borrowers. However, certain cardholders’ 
FICO scores may decrease over time, depending on the 
performance of the cardholder and changes in the credit 
score calculation. 
The following tables provide information on delinquency, which is the primary credit quality indicator for retained credit card 
loans.

Loan modifications 
The Firm may offer loan modification programs granting 
concessions to credit card borrowers who are experiencing 
financial difficulty. The Firm grants concessions for most of 
the credit card loans under long-term programs. These 
modifications involve placing the customer on a fixed 
payment plan, generally for 60 months, and typically 
include reducing the interest rate on the credit card. 
Substantially all modifications under the Firm’s long-term 
programs are considered to be TDRs. Loans with short-term 
or other insignificant modifications that are not considered 
concessions are not TDRs. 
If the cardholder does not comply with the modified 
payment terms, then the credit card loan continues to age 
and will ultimately be charged-off in accordance with the 
Firm’s standard charge-off policy. In most cases, the Firm 
does not reinstate the borrower’s line of credit. 
Financial effects of modifications and redefaults 
The following table provides information about the financial 
effects of the concessions granted on credit card loans 
modified in TDRs and redefaults for the periods presented. 
For all periods disclosed, new enrollments were less than 
1% of total retained credit card loans.

within one year of the modification. The amounts presented represent 
the balance of such loans as of the end of the quarter in which they 
defaulted.
For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is 
deemed to have occurred when the borrower misses two 
consecutive contractual payments. Defaulted modified 
credit card loans remain in the modification program and 
continue to be charged off in accordance with the Firm’s 
standard charge-off policy.

Wholesale loan portfolio
Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, 
ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to 
high-net-worth individuals.
The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is 
the internal risk rating assigned to each loan. Risk ratings 
are used to identify the credit quality of loans and 
differentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk ratings on loans 
consider the PD and the LGD. The PD is the likelihood that a 
loan will default. The LGD is the estimated loss on the loan 
that would be realized upon the default of the borrower and 
takes into consideration collateral and structural support 
for each credit facility. 
Management considers several factors to determine an 
appropriate internal risk rating, including the obligor’s debt 
capacity and financial flexibility, the level of the obligor’s 
earnings, the amount and sources for repayment, the level 
and nature of contingencies, management strength, and the 
industry and geography in which the obligor operates. The 
Firm’s internal risk ratings generally align with the 
qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet 
financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the 
economic environment) defined by S&P and Moody’s, 
however the quantitative characteristics (e.g., PD and LGD) 
may differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and 
assumptions. The Firm generally considers internal ratings 
with qualitative characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or 
higher as investment grade, and these ratings have a lower 
PD and/or lower LGD than non-investment grade ratings. 
Noninvestment-grade ratings are further classified as 
noncriticized and criticized, and the criticized portion is 
further subdivided into performing and nonaccrual loans, 
representing management’s assessment of the collectibility 
of principal and interest. Criticized loans have a higher PD 
than noncriticized loans. The Firm’s definition of criticized 
aligns with the U.S. banking regulatory definition of 
criticized exposures, which consist of special mention, 
substandard and doubtful categories. 
Risk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by 
Credit Risk Management and are adjusted as necessary for 
updated information affecting the obligor’s ability to fulfill 
its obligations.
As noted above, the risk rating of a loan considers the 
industry in which the obligor conducts its operations. As 
part of the overall credit risk management framework, the 
Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its 
industry and client exposures, with particular attention paid 
to industries with an actual or potential credit concern. 
Refer to Note 4 for further detail on industry 
concentrations.

(b) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis were not material for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Loan modifications 
Certain loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing 
financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs 
nor are loans for which the Firm has elected to suspend TDR accounting guidance under the option provided by the CARES Act. 
New TDRs during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $801 million, $881 million and $734 million, 
respectively. New TDRs during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 reflected the extension of maturity dates, 
covenant waivers, receipt of assets in partial satisfaction of the loan and deferral of principal and interest payments, 
predominantly in the Commercial and Industrial and Other loan classes. The impact of these modifications resulting in new 
TDRs was not material to the Firm for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.
The carrying value of TDRs was $936 million and $607 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Note 13 – Allowance for credit losses
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents 
management's estimate of expected credit losses over the 
remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets 
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet 
lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit 
losses comprises:
• the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s 
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is 
presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets, 
• the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is 
presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts 
payable and other liabilities, and 
• the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, 
which is reflected in investment securities on the 
Consolidated balance sheets. 
The income statement effect of all changes in the allowance 
for credit losses is recognized in the provision for credit 
losses. 
Determining the appropriateness of the allowance for credit 
losses is complex and requires significant judgment by 
management about the effect of matters that are inherently 
uncertain. At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses 
is reviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller of the 
Firm. Subsequent evaluations of credit exposures, 
considering the macroeconomic conditions, forecasts and 
other factors then prevailing, may result in significant 
changes in the allowance for credit losses in future periods. 
The Firm’s policies used to determine its allowance for loan 
losses and its allowance for lending-related commitments 
are described in the following paragraphs. Refer to Note 10 
for a description of the policies used to determine the 
allowance for credit losses on investment securities. 
Methodology for allowances for loan losses and lendingrelated commitments
The allowance for loan losses and allowance for lendingrelated commitments represents expected credit losses 
over the remaining expected life of retained loans and 
lending-related commitments that are not unconditionally 
cancellable. The Firm does not record an allowance for 
future draws on unconditionally cancellable lending-related 
commitments (e.g., credit cards). Expected losses related to 
accrued interest on credit card loans are considered in the 
Firm’s allowance for loan losses. However, the Firm does 
not record an allowance on other accrued interest 
receivables, due to its policy to write these receivables off 
no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest 
income. 
The expected life of each instrument is determined by 
considering its contractual term, expected prepayments, 
cancellation features, and certain extension and call 
options. The expected life of funded credit card loans is 
generally estimated by considering expected future 
payments on the credit card account, and determining how 
much of those amounts should be allocated to repayments 
of the funded loan balance (as of the balance sheet date) 
versus other account activity. This allocation is made using 
an approach that incorporates the payment application 
requirements of the Credit Card Accountability 
Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, generally paying 
down the highest interest rate balances first. 
The estimate of expected credit losses includes expected 
recoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to 
be charged off, even if such recoveries result in a negative 
allowance. 
Collective and Individual Assessments
When calculating the allowance for loan losses and the 
allowance for lending-related commitments, the Firm 
assesses whether exposures share similar risk 
characteristics. If similar risk characteristics exist, the Firm 
estimates expected credit losses collectively, considering 
the risk associated with a particular pool and the probability 
that the exposures within the pool will deteriorate or 
default. The assessment of risk characteristics is subject to 
significant management judgment. Emphasizing one 
characteristic over another or considering additional 
characteristics could affect the allowance. 
• Relevant risk characteristics for the consumer portfolio 
include product type, delinquency status, current FICO 
scores, geographic distribution, and, for collateralized 
loans, current LTV ratios. 
• Relevant risk characteristics for the wholesale portfolio 
include risk rating, delinquency status, tenor, level and 
type of collateral, LOB, geography, industry, credit 
enhancement, product type, facility purpose, and 
payment terms. 
The majority of the Firm’s credit exposures share risk 
characteristics with other similar exposures, and as a result 
are collectively assessed for impairment (“portfolio-based 
component”). The portfolio-based component covers 
consumer loans, performing risk-rated loans and certain 
lending-related commitments. 
If an exposure does not share risk characteristics with other 
exposures, the Firm generally estimates expected credit 
losses on an individual basis, considering expected 
repayment and conditions impacting that individual 
exposure (“asset-specific component”). The asset-specific 
component covers modified PCD loans, loans modified or 
reasonably expected to be modified in a TDR, collateraldependent loans, as well as, risk-rated loans that have been 
placed on nonaccrual status. 
Portfolio-based component
The portfolio-based component begins with a quantitative 
calculation that considers the likelihood of the borrower 
changing delinquency status or moving from one risk rating 
to another. The quantitative calculation covers expected 
credit losses over an instrument’s expected life and is 
estimated by applying credit loss factors to the Firm’s 
estimated exposure at default. The credit loss factors 
incorporate the probability of borrower default as well as 
loss severity in the event of default. They are derived using 
Notes to consolidated financial statements

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

a weighted average of five internally developed 
macroeconomic scenarios over an eight-quarter forecast 
period, followed by a single year straight-line interpolation 
to revert to long run historical information for periods 
beyond the eight-quarter forecast period. The five 
macroeconomic scenarios consist of a central, relative 
adverse, extreme adverse, relative upside and extreme 
upside scenario, and are updated by the Firm’s central 
forecasting team. The scenarios take into consideration the 
Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, internal perspectives from 
subject matter experts across the Firm, and market 
consensus and involve a governed process that incorporates 
feedback from senior management across LOBs, Corporate 
Finance and Risk Management.
The quantitative calculation is adjusted to take into 
consideration model imprecision, emerging risk 
assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are 
not yet reflected in the calculation. These adjustments are 
accomplished in part by analyzing the historical loss 
experience, including during stressed periods, for each 
major product or model. Management applies judgment in 
making this adjustment, including taking into account 
uncertainties associated with the economic and political 
conditions, quality of underwriting standards, borrower 
behavior, credit concentrations or deterioration within an 
industry, product or portfolio, as well as other relevant 
internal and external factors affecting the credit quality of 
the portfolio. In certain instances, the interrelationships 
between these factors create further uncertainties.
The application of different inputs into the quantitative 
calculation, and the assumptions used by management to 
adjust the quantitative calculation, are subject to significant 
management judgment, and emphasizing one input or 
assumption over another, or considering other inputs or 
assumptions, could affect the estimate of the allowance for 
loan losses and the allowance for lending-related 
commitments.
Asset-specific component 
To determine the asset-specific component of the 
allowance, collateral-dependent loans (including those 
loans for which foreclosure is probable) and larger, 
nonaccrual risk-rated loans in the wholesale portfolio 
segment are generally evaluated individually, while smaller 
loans (both scored and risk-rated) are aggregated for 
evaluation using factors relevant for the respective class of 
assets. 
The Firm generally measures the asset-specific allowance as 
the difference between the amortized cost of the loan and 
the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected, 
discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate. 
Subsequent changes in impairment are generally 
recognized as an adjustment to the allowance for loan 
losses. For collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of 
collateral less estimated costs to sell is used to determine 
the charge-off amount for declines in value (to reduce the 
amortized cost of the loan to the fair value of collateral) or 
the amount of negative allowance that should be 
recognized (for recoveries of prior charge-offs associated 
with improvements in the fair value of collateral). 
The asset-specific component of the allowance for loans 
that have been or are expected to be modified in TDRs 
incorporates the effect of the modification on the loan’s 
expected cash flows (including forgone interest, principal 
forgiveness, as well as other concessions), and also the 
potential for redefault. For residential real estate loans 
modified in or expected to be modified in TDRs, the Firm 
develops product-specific probability of default estimates, 
which are applied at a loan level to compute expected 
losses. In developing these probabilities of default, the Firm 
considers the relationship between the credit quality 
characteristics of the underlying loans and certain 
assumptions about housing prices and unemployment, 
based upon industry-wide data. The Firm also considers its 
own historical loss experience to-date based on actual 
redefaulted modified loans. For credit card loans modified 
in or expected to be modified in TDRs, expected losses 
incorporate projected delinquencies and charge-offs based 
on the Firm’s historical experience by type of modification 
program. For wholesale loans modified or expected to be 
modified in TDRs, expected losses incorporate 
management’s expectation of the borrower’s ability to 
repay under the modified terms. 
Estimating the timing and amounts of future cash flows is 
highly judgmental as these cash flow projections rely upon 
estimates such as loss severities, asset valuations, default 
rates (including redefault rates on modified loans), the 
amounts and timing of interest or principal payments 
(including any expected prepayments) or other factors that 
are reflective of current and expected market conditions. 
These estimates are, in turn, dependent on factors such as 
the duration of current overall economic conditions, 
industry, portfolio, or borrower-specific factors, the 
expected outcome of insolvency proceedings as well as, in 
certain circumstances, other economic factors. All of these 
estimates and assumptions require significant management 
judgment and certain assumptions are highly subjective.

Discussion of changes in the allowance
The allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2022 
was $22.2 billion, reflecting a net addition of $3.5 billion 
from December 31, 2021, consisting of: 
• $2.3 billion in wholesale, driven by deterioration in the 
Firm’s macroeconomic outlook and loan growth, 
predominantly in CB and CIB, and
• $1.2 billion in consumer, predominantly driven by Card 
Services, reflecting higher outstanding balances and 
deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, 
partially offset by a reduction in the allowance related to 
a decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower 
behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede. 
Deterioration in the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook included 
both updates to the central scenario in the fourth quarter of 
2022, which now reflects a mild recession, as well as the 
impact of the increased weight placed on the adverse 
scenarios beginning in the first quarter of 2022 due to the 
effects associated with higher inflation, changes in 
monetary policy, and geopolitical risks, including the war in 
Ukraine. 
The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a 
weighted average of five internally developed 
macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios 
incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the 
central case assumptions provided in the table below, 
resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate 
peaking at 5.6% in the second quarter of 2024, and a 
1.2% lower U.S. real GDP exiting the second quarter of 
2024.
The Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S. 
unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:

Subsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates
will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future
periods.

Refer to Note 1 on page 164 for a further description of JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies regarding consolidation of VIEs. 
The following table summarizes the most significant types of Firm-sponsored VIEs by business segment. The Firm considers a 
“Firm-sponsored” VIE to include any entity where: (1) JPMorgan Chase is the primary beneficiary of the structure; (2) the VIE 
is used by JPMorgan Chase to securitize Firm assets; (3) the VIE issues financial instruments with the JPMorgan Chase name; 
or (4) the entity is a JPMorgan Chase–administered asset-backed commercial paper conduit.

The Firm’s other business segments are also involved with VIEs (both third-party and Firm-sponsored), but to a lesser extent, 
as follows: 
Asset & Wealth Management: AWM sponsors and manages certain funds that are deemed VIEs. As asset manager of the 
funds, AWM earns a fee based on assets managed; the fee varies with each fund’s investment objective and is competitively 
priced. For fund entities that qualify as VIEs, AWM’s interests are, in certain cases, considered to be significant variable 
interests that result in consolidation of the financial results of these entities.
Commercial Banking: CB provides financing and lending-related services to a wide spectrum of clients, including certain 
third-party-sponsored entities that may meet the definition of a VIE. CB does not control the activities of these entities and 
does not consolidate these entities. CB’s maximum loss exposure, regardless of whether the entity is a VIE, is generally 
limited to loans and lending-related commitments which are reported and disclosed in the same manner as any other thirdparty transaction. 
Corporate: Corporate is involved with entities that may meet the definition of VIEs; however these entities are generally 
subject to specialized investment company accounting, which does not require the consolidation of investments, including 
VIEs. In addition, Treasury and CIO invest in securities generally issued by third parties which may meet the definition of 
VIEs (e.g., issuers of asset-backed securities). In general, the Firm does not have the power to direct the significant 
activities of these entities and therefore does not consolidate these entities. Refer to Note 10 for further information on the 
Firm’s investment securities portfolio.
In addition, CIB also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third parties. Refer to pages 
251-252 of this Note for more information on consolidated VIE assets and liabilities as well as the VIEs sponsored by third 
parties.
Significant Firm-sponsored variable interest entities
Credit card securitizations
CCB’s Card Services business may securitize originated 
credit card loans, primarily through the Chase Issuance 
Trust (the “Trust”). The Firm’s continuing involvement in 
credit card securitizations includes servicing the 
receivables, retaining an undivided seller’s interest in the 
receivables, retaining certain senior and subordinated 
securities and maintaining escrow accounts. 
The Firm consolidates the assets and liabilities of its 
sponsored credit card trusts as it is considered to be the 
primary beneficiary of these securitization trusts based on 
the Firm’s ability to direct the activities of these VIEs 
through its servicing responsibilities and other duties, 
including making decisions as to the receivables that are 
transferred into those trusts and as to any related 
modifications and workouts. Additionally, the nature and 
extent of the Firm’s other continuing involvement with the 
trusts, as indicated above, obligates the Firm to absorb 
losses and gives the Firm the right to receive certain 
benefits from these VIEs that could potentially be 
significant. 
The underlying securitized credit card receivables and other 
assets of the securitization trusts are available only for 
payment of the beneficial interests issued by the 
securitization trusts; they are not available to pay the Firm’s 
other obligations or the claims of the Firm’s creditors. 
The agreements with the credit card securitization trusts 
require the Firm to maintain a minimum undivided interest 
in the credit card trusts (generally 5%). As of 
December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Firm held undivided 
interests in Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts 
of $6.1 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively. The Firm 
maintained an average undivided interest in principal 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

receivables owned by those trusts of approximately 62% 
and 57% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 
2021, respectively. The Firm did not retain any senior 
securities and retained $1.5 billion of subordinated 
securities in certain of its credit card securitization trusts at 
both December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Firm’s undivided 
interests in the credit card trusts and securities retained are 
eliminated in consolidation. 
Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts
The Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and 
purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages 
and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB and CIB 
businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well 
as the respective business involved, the Firm may act as the 
servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial 
interests in the securitization trusts.
The following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label securitization 
entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by the Firm. Continuing 
involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or subordinated interests (including amounts required to be 
held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or guarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain 
instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. The Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and 
purchased interests is the carrying value of these interests.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Residential mortgage
The Firm securitizes residential mortgage loans originated 
by CCB, as well as residential mortgage loans purchased 
from third parties by either CCB or CIB. CCB generally 
retains servicing for all residential mortgage loans it 
originated or purchased, and for certain mortgage loans 
purchased by CIB. For securitizations of loans serviced by 
CCB, the Firm has the power to direct the significant 
activities of the VIE because it is responsible for decisions 
related to loan modifications and workouts. CCB may also 
retain an interest upon securitization.
In addition, CIB engages in underwriting and trading 
activities involving securities issued by Firm-sponsored 
securitization trusts. As a result, CIB at times retains senior 
and/or subordinated interests (including residual interests 
and amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk 
retention rules) in residential mortgage securitizations at 
the time of securitization, and/or reacquires positions in the 
secondary market in the normal course of business. In 
certain instances, as a result of the positions retained or 
reacquired by CIB or held by Treasury and CIO or CCB, when 
considered together with the servicing arrangements 
entered into by CCB, the Firm is deemed to be the primary 
beneficiary of certain securitization trusts. 
The Firm does not consolidate residential mortgage 
securitizations (Firm-sponsored or third-party-sponsored) 
when it is not the servicer (and therefore does not have the 
power to direct the most significant activities of the trust) 
or does not hold a beneficial interest in the trust that could 
potentially be significant to the trust.
Commercial mortgages and other consumer securitizations
CIB originates and securitizes commercial mortgage loans, 
and engages in underwriting and trading activities involving 
the securities issued by securitization trusts. CIB may retain 
unsold senior and/or subordinated interests (including 
amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk 
retention rules) in commercial mortgage securitizations at 
the time of securitization but, generally, the Firm does not 
service commercial loan securitizations. Treasury and CIO 
may choose to invest in these securitizations as well. For 
commercial mortgage securitizations the power to direct 
the significant activities of the VIE generally is held by the 
servicer or investors in a specified class of securities 
(“controlling class”). The Firm generally does not retain an 
interest in the controlling class in its sponsored commercial 
mortgage securitization transactions.
Re-securitizations
The Firm engages in certain re-securitization transactions in 
which debt securities are transferred to a VIE in exchange 
for new beneficial interests. These transfers occur in 
connection with both U.S. GSEs and government agency 
sponsored VIEs, which are backed by residential mortgages. 
The Firm’s consolidation analysis is largely dependent on 
the Firm’s role and interest in the re-securitization trusts.
The following table presents the principal amount of 
securities transferred to re-securitization VIEs.
Year ended December 31, 
(in millions)

Transfers of securities to VIEs
U.S. GSEs and government 
agencies
$ 16,128 
53,923 
46,123 
Most re-securitizations with which the Firm is involved are 
client-driven transactions in which a specific client or group 
of clients is seeking a specific return or risk profile. For 
these transactions, the Firm has concluded that the 
decision-making power of the entity is shared between the 
Firm and its clients, considering the joint effort and 
decisions in establishing the re-securitization trust and its 
assets, as well as the significant economic interest the client 
holds in the re-securitization trust; therefore the Firm does 
not consolidate the re-securitization VIE.
The Firm did not transfer any private label securities to resecuritization VIEs during 2022, 2021 and 2020, and 
retained interests in any such Firm-sponsored VIEs as of 
December 31, 2022 and 2021 were not material.
Additionally, the Firm may invest in beneficial interests of 
third-party-sponsored re-securitizations and generally 
purchases these interests in the secondary market. In these 
circumstances, the Firm does not have the unilateral ability 
to direct the most significant activities of the resecuritization trust, either because it was not involved in 
the initial design of the trust, or the Firm was involved with 
an independent third-party sponsor and demonstrated 
shared power over the creation of the trust; therefore, the 
Firm does not consolidate the re-securitization VIE.

Multi-seller conduits
Multi-seller conduit entities are separate bankruptcy 
remote entities that provide secured financing, 
collateralized by pools of receivables and other financial 
assets, to customers of the Firm. The conduits fund their 
financing facilities through the issuance of highly rated 
commercial paper. The primary source of repayment of the 
commercial paper is the cash flows from the pools of assets. 
In most instances, the assets are structured with dealspecific credit enhancements provided to the conduits by 
the customers (i.e., sellers) or other third parties. Dealspecific credit enhancements are generally structured to 
cover a multiple of historical losses expected on the pool of 
assets, and are typically in the form of overcollateralization 
provided by the seller. The deal-specific credit 
enhancements mitigate the Firm’s potential losses on its 
agreements with the conduits.
To ensure timely repayment of the commercial paper, and 
to provide the conduits with funding to provide financing to 
customers in the event that the conduits do not obtain 
funding in the commercial paper market, each asset pool 
financed by the conduits has a minimum 100% dealspecific liquidity facility associated with it provided by 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. also 
provides the multi-seller conduit vehicles with uncommitted 
program-wide liquidity facilities and program-wide credit 
enhancement in the form of standby letters of credit. The 
amount of program-wide credit enhancement required is 
based upon commercial paper issuance and approximates 
10% of the outstanding balance of commercial paper.
The Firm consolidates its Firm-administered multi-seller 
conduits, as the Firm has both the power to direct the 
significant activities of the conduits and a potentially 
significant economic interest in the conduits. As 
administrative agent and in its role in structuring 
transactions, the Firm makes decisions regarding asset 
types and credit quality, and manages the commercial 
paper funding needs of the conduits. The Firm’s interests 
that could potentially be significant to the VIEs include the 
fees received as administrative agent and liquidity and 
program-wide credit enhancement provider, as well as the 
potential exposure created by the liquidity and credit 
enhancement facilities provided to the conduits.
In the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes 
markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by the 
Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held 
$13.8 billion and $13.7 billion of the commercial paper 
issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at 
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which have 
been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm’s investments 
reflect the Firm’s funding needs and capacity and were not 
driven by market illiquidity. Other than the amounts 
required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules, 
the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase 
the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered 
multi-seller conduits.
Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and 
credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been 
eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firmadministered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related 
commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered 
multi-seller conduits. The unfunded commitments were 
$10.6 billion and $13.4 billion at December 31, 2022 and 
2021, respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet 
lending-related commitments in other unfunded 
commitments to extend credit. Refer to Note 28 for more 
information on off-balance sheet lending-related 
commitments. 
Municipal bond vehicles
Municipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”) 
trusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond 
investments at short-term rates. In a typical TOB 
transaction, the trust purchases highly rated municipal 
bond(s) of a single issuer and funds the purchase by issuing 
two types of securities: (1) puttable floating-rate 
certificates (“floaters”) and (2) inverse floating-rate 
residual interests (“residuals”). The floaters are typically 
purchased by money market funds or other short-term 
investors and may be tendered, with requisite notice, to the 
TOB trust. The residuals are retained by the investor 
seeking to finance its municipal bond investment. TOB 
transactions where the residual is held by a third-party 
investor are typically known as customer TOB trusts, and 
non-customer TOB trusts are transactions where the 
Residual is retained by the Firm. Customer TOB trusts are 
sponsored by a third party. The Firm serves as sponsor for 
all non-customer TOB transactions. The Firm may provide 
various services to a TOB trust, including remarketing 
agent, liquidity or tender option provider, and/or sponsor.
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC may serve as a remarketing 
agent on the floaters for TOB trusts. The remarketing agent 
is responsible for establishing the periodic variable rate on 
the floaters, conducting the initial placement and 
remarketing tendered floaters. The remarketing agent may, 
but is not obligated to, make markets in floaters. Floaters 
held by the Firm were not material during 2022 and 2021.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or J.P. Morgan Securities LLC 
often serves as the sole liquidity or tender option provider 
for the TOB trusts. The liquidity provider’s obligation to 
perform is conditional and is limited by certain events 
Notes to consolidated financial statements

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

(“Termination Events”), which include bankruptcy or failure 
to pay by the municipal bond issuer or credit enhancement 
provider, an event of taxability on the municipal bonds or 
the immediate downgrade of the municipal bond to below 
investment grade. In addition, the liquidity provider’s 
exposure is typically further limited by the high credit 
quality of the underlying municipal bonds, the excess 
collateralization in the vehicle, or, in certain transactions, 
the reimbursement agreements with the Residual holders.
Holders of the floaters may “put,” or tender, their floaters 
to the TOB trust. If the remarketing agent cannot 
successfully remarket the floaters to another investor, the 
liquidity provider either provides a loan to the TOB trust for 
the TOB trust’s purchase of the floaters, or it directly 
purchases the tendered floaters. 
TOB trusts are considered to be variable interest entities. 
The Firm consolidates non-customer TOB trusts because as 
the Residual holder, the Firm has the right to make 
decisions that significantly impact the economic 
performance of the municipal bond vehicle, and it has the 
right to receive benefits and bear losses that could 
potentially be significant to the municipal bond vehicle.

(f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

VIEs sponsored by third parties 
The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by 
other parties. These include, for example, acting as a 
derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, 
underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee 
or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’slength, and individual credit decisions are based on the 
analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the 
quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not 
have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most 
significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a 
variable interest that could potentially be significant, the 
Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records 
and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance 
sheets in the same manner it would record and report 
positions in respect of any other third-party transaction. 
Tax credit vehicles 
The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit 
vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities 
that own and operate affordable housing, energy, and other 
projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A 
third party is typically the general partner or managing 
member and has control over the significant activities of the 
tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not 
consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in 
these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return 
primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the 
projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by 
equity investments and funding commitments, was $30.2 
billion and $26.8 billion, of which $10.6 billion and $9.4 
billion was unfunded at December 31, 2022 and 2021, 
respectively. The Firm assesses each project and to reduce 
the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital 
investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer 
to Note 25 for further information on affordable housing 
tax credits and Note 28 for more information on off-balance 
sheet lending-related commitments.
Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) 
The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB 
trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender 
option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the 
Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a 
reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In 
those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the 
Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for 
any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to protect 
Residual holders from potential losses on any of the 
underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate 
customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the 
power to make decisions that significantly impact the 
economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle.
The Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to 
customer TOB trusts at December 31, 2022 and 2021, was 
$5.8 billion and $6.8 billion, respectively. The fair value of 
assets held by such VIEs at December 31, 2022 and 2021 
was $8.2 billion and $10.5 billion respectively.
Loan securitizations
The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, 
including residential mortgages, credit card receivables, 
commercial mortgages and other consumer loans. The 
purposes of these securitization transactions were to satisfy 
investor demand and to generate liquidity for the Firm.
For loan securitizations in which the Firm is not required to 
consolidate the trust, the Firm records the transfer of the 
loan receivable to the trust as a sale when all of the 
following accounting criteria for a sale are met: (1) the 
transferred financial assets are legally isolated from the 
Firm’s creditors; (2) the transferee or beneficial interest 
holder can pledge or exchange the transferred financial 
assets; and (3) the Firm does not maintain effective control 
over the transferred financial assets (e.g., the Firm cannot 
repurchase the transferred assets before their maturity and 
it does not have the ability to unilaterally cause the holder 
to return the transferred assets).
For loan securitizations accounted for as a sale, the Firm 
recognizes a gain or loss based on the difference between 
the value of proceeds received (including cash, beneficial 
interests, or servicing assets received) and the carrying 
value of the assets sold. Gains and losses on securitizations 
are reported in noninterest revenue.

business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans 
and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis, 
predominantly to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs 
are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the 
U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., 
credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans 
into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae 
guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed 
by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not 
consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these 
transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a 
limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share 
a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans 
with the purchaser. Refer to Note 28 for additional 
information about the Firm’s loan sales- and securitizationrelated indemnifications and Note 15 for additional 
information about the impact of the Firm’s sale of certain 
excess MSRs.

Options to repurchase delinquent loans
In addition to the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain 
loans due to material breaches of representations and 
warranties as discussed in Note 28, the Firm also has the 
option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for 
Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government 
agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm typically 
elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan 
pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the 
foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable 
requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or 
guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase option becomes 
exercisable, such loans must be reported on the 
Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding 
liability. Refer to Note 12 for additional information.

Note 15 – Goodwill and Mortgage servicing rights
Goodwill
Goodwill is recorded upon completion of a business 
combination as the difference between the purchase price 
and the fair value of the net assets acquired, and can be 
adjusted up to one year from the acquisition date as more 
information is obtained about the fair value of assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for 
impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or 
more often if events or circumstances, such as adverse 
changes in the business climate, indicate that there may be 
an impairment.
The goodwill associated with each business combination is 
allocated to the related reporting units, which are generally 
determined based on how the Firm’s businesses are 
managed and how they are reviewed. The following table 
presents goodwill attributed to the reportable business 
segments and Corporate.

Goodwill impairment testing
The Firm’s goodwill was not impaired at December 31, 
2022, 2021 and 2020.
The goodwill impairment test is generally performed by 
comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit with 
its carrying value. If the fair value is in excess of the 
carrying value, then the reporting unit’s goodwill is 
considered not to be impaired. If the fair value is less than 
the carrying value, then an impairment charge is recognized 
for the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying value 
exceeds its fair value, up to the amount of goodwill 
allocated to that reporting unit. 
The Firm uses the reporting units’ allocated capital plus 
goodwill and other intangible assets as a proxy for the 
carrying values of equity for the reporting units in the 
goodwill impairment testing. Reporting unit equity is 
determined on a similar basis as the allocation of capital to 
the LOBs which takes into consideration a variety of factors 
including capital levels of similarly rated peers and 
applicable regulatory capital requirements. Proposed LOB 
capital levels are incorporated into the Firm’s annual 
budget process, which is reviewed by the Firm’s Board of 
Directors and Operating Committee. Allocated capital is 
further reviewed at least annually and updated as needed.
The primary method the Firm uses to estimate the fair value 
of its reporting units is the income approach. This approach 
projects cash flows for the forecast period and uses the 
perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal values. 
These cash flows and terminal values, which are based on 
the reporting units’ annual budgets and forecasts are then 
discounted using an appropriate discount rate. The discount 
rate used for each reporting unit represents an estimate of 
the cost of equity for that reporting unit and is determined 
considering the Firm’s overall estimated cost of equity 
(estimated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model), as 
adjusted for the risk characteristics specific to each 
reporting unit (for example, for higher levels of risk or 
uncertainty associated with the business or management’s 
forecasts and assumptions). To assess the reasonableness 
of the discount rates used for each reporting unit, 
management compares the discount rate to the estimated 
cost of equity for publicly traded institutions with similar 
businesses and risk characteristics. In addition, the 
weighted average cost of equity (aggregating the various 
reporting units) is compared with the Firm’s overall 
estimated cost of equity to ensure reasonableness. The 
valuations derived from the discounted cash flow analysis 
are then compared with market-based trading and 
transaction multiples for relevant competitors. Trading and 
transaction comparables are used as general indicators to 
assess the overall reasonableness of the estimated fair 
values, although precise conclusions generally cannot be 
drawn due to the differences that naturally exist between 
the Firm’s businesses and competitor institutions. 
The Firm also takes into consideration a comparison 
between the aggregate fair values of the Firm’s reporting 
units and JPMorgan Chase’s market capitalization. In 
evaluating this comparison, the Firm considers several 
factors, including (i) a control premium that would exist in a 
market transaction, (ii) factors related to the level of 
execution risk that would exist at the Firmwide level that do 
not exist at the reporting unit level and (iii) short-term 
market volatility and other factors that do not directly 
affect the value of individual reporting units.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases 
in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as well as 
deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse 
regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the 
estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated 
fair values of the Firm’s reporting units to decline in the 
future, which could result in a material impairment charge 
to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the 
associated goodwill. 
Mortgage servicing rights
MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows 
for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value 
considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary 
revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and 
generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are 
received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against 
contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are 
either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale 
or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained.
As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to account 
for its MSRs at fair value. The Firm treats its MSRs as a 
single class of servicing assets based on the availability of 
market inputs used to measure the fair value of its MSR 
asset and its treatment of MSRs as one aggregate pool for 
risk management purposes. The Firm estimates the fair 
value of MSRs using an option-adjusted spread (“OAS”) 
model, which projects MSR cash flows over multiple interest 
rate scenarios in conjunction with the Firm’s prepayment 
model, and then discounts these cash flows at risk-adjusted 
rates. The model considers portfolio characteristics, 
contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment 
assumptions, delinquency rates, costs to service, late 
charges and other ancillary revenue, and other economic 
factors. The Firm compares fair value estimates and 
assumptions to observable market data where available, 
and also considers recent market activity and actual 
portfolio experience. 
Notes to consolidated financial statements

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

The fair value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in interest 
rates, including their effect on prepayment speeds. MSRs 
typically decrease in value when interest rates decline 
because declining interest rates tend to increase 
prepayments and therefore reduce the expected life of the 
net servicing cash flows that comprise the MSR asset. 
Conversely, securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities), 
and certain derivatives (e.g., those for which the Firm 
receives fixed-rate interest payments) increase in value 
when interest rates decline. JPMorgan Chase uses 
combinations of derivatives and securities to manage the 
risk of changes in the fair value of MSRs. The intent is to 
offset any interest-rate related changes in the fair value of 
MSRs with changes in the fair value of the related risk 
management instruments.
The following table summarizes MSR activity for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right 
to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if 
they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements.

Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions 
generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the 
relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change 
in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be 
linear. In the following table, the effect that a change in a 
particular assumption may have on the fair value is 
calculated without changing any other assumption. In 
reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in 
another, which would either magnify or counteract the 
impact of the initial change.

used to determine the fair value of the Firm’s MSRs at

Note 16 – Premises and equipment
Premises and equipment, including leasehold 
improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and amortization. JPMorgan Chase computes 
depreciation using the straight-line method over the 
estimated useful life of an asset. For leasehold 
improvements, the Firm uses the straight-line method 
computed over the lesser of the remainder of the lease 
term, or estimated useful life of the improvements. 
JPMorgan Chase capitalizes certain costs associated with 
the acquisition or development of internal-use software. 
Once the software is ready for its intended use, these costs 
are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software’s 
expected useful life. 
Impairment is assessed periodically when events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset 
may not be fully recoverable.

Note 18 - Leases
Firm as lessee
At December 31, 2022, JPMorgan Chase and its 
subsidiaries were obligated under a number of 
noncancellable leases, predominantly operating leases for 
premises and equipment used primarily for business 
purposes. These leases generally have terms of 20 years or 
less, determined based on the contractual maturity of the 
lease, and include periods covered by options to extend or 
terminate the lease when the Firm is reasonably certain 
that it will exercise those options. All leases with lease 
terms greater than twelve months are reported as a lease 
liability with a corresponding right-of-use (“ROU”) asset. 
None of these lease agreements impose restrictions on the 
Firm’s ability to pay dividends, engage in debt or equity 
financing transactions or enter into further lease 
agreements. Certain of these leases contain escalation 
clauses that will increase rental payments based on 
maintenance, utility and tax increases, which are non-lease 
components. The Firm elected not to separate lease and 
non-lease components of a contract for its real estate 
leases. As such, real estate lease payments represent 
payments on both lease and non-lease components. 
Operating lease liabilities and ROU assets are recognized at 
the lease commencement date based on the present value 
of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. 
The future lease payments are discounted at a rate that 
estimates the Firm’s collateralized borrowing rate for 
financing instruments of a similar term and are included in 
accounts payable and other liabilities. The operating lease 
ROU asset, included in premises and equipment, also 
includes any lease prepayments made, plus initial direct 
costs incurred, less any lease incentives received. Rental 
expense associated with operating leases is recognized on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term, and generally 
included in occupancy expense in the Consolidated 
statements of income.

Firm as lessor
The Firm provides auto and equipment lease financing to its 
customers through lease arrangements with lease terms 
that may contain renewal, termination and/or purchase 
options. The Firm’s lease financings are predominantly auto 
operating leases. These assets subject to operating leases 
are recognized in other assets on the Firm’s Consolidated 
balance sheets and are depreciated on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term to reduce the asset to its estimated 
residual value. Depreciation expense is included in 
technology, communications and equipment expense in the 
Consolidated statements of income. The Firm’s lease 
income is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term and is included in other income in the 
Consolidated statements of income. 
On a periodic basis, the Firm assesses leased assets for 
impairment, and if the carrying amount of the leased asset 
exceeds the undiscounted cash flows from the lease 
payments and the estimated residual value upon disposition 
of the leased asset, an impairment loss is recognized. 
The risk of loss on auto and equipment leased assets 
relating to the residual value of the leased assets is 
monitored through projections of the asset residual values 
at lease origination and periodic review of residual values, 
and is mitigated through arrangements with certain 
manufacturers or lessees. 
The following table presents the carrying value of assets 
subject to leases reported on the Consolidated balance 
sheets:

(a) Included long-term debt of $13.8 billion and $14.1 billion secured by assets totaling $208.3 billion and $170.6 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, 
respectively. The amount of long-term debt secured by assets does not include amounts related to hybrid instruments. 
(b) Included $72.3 billion and $74.9 billion of long-term debt accounted for at fair value at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
(c) Included $10.3 billion and $15.8 billion of outstanding zero-coupon notes at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The aggregate principal amount 
of these notes at their respective maturities is $45.3 billion and $46.4 billion, respectively. The aggregate principal amount reflects the contractual 
principal payment at maturity, which may exceed the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date, if applicable.
(d) Included on the Consolidated balance sheets in beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs. Also included $5 million and $12 million accounted for at 
fair value at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Excluded short-term commercial paper and other short-term beneficial interests of $10.5 billion 
and $8.2 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
(e) The interest rates shown are the weighted average of contractual rates in effect at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, including non-U.S. dollar 
fixed- and variable-rate issuances, which excludes the effects of the associated derivative instruments used in hedge accounting relationships, if 
applicable. The interest rates shown exclude structured notes accounted for at fair value.
(f) At December 31, 2022, long-term debt in the aggregate of $194.9 billion was redeemable at the option of JPMorgan Chase, in whole or in part, prior to 
maturity, based on the terms specified in the respective instruments.
(g) The aggregate carrying values of debt that matures in each of the five years subsequent to 2022 is $32.2 billion in 2023, $40.1 billion in 2024, $34.3 
billion in 2025, $32.5 billion in 2026 and $22.8 billion in 2027.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

The weighted-average contractual interest rates for total 
long-term debt excluding structured notes accounted for at 
fair value were 3.26% and 2.67% as of December 31, 
2022 and 2021, respectively. In order to modify exposure 
to interest rate and currency exchange rate movements, 
JPMorgan Chase utilizes derivative instruments, primarily 
interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps, in 
conjunction with some of its debt issuances. The use of 
these instruments modifies the Firm’s interest expense on 
the associated debt. The modified weighted-average 
interest rates for total long-term debt, including the effects 
of related derivative instruments, were 4.89% and 1.43% 
as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. has guaranteed certain long-term 
debt of its subsidiaries, including structured notes. These 
guarantees rank on parity with the Firm’s other unsecured 
and unsubordinated indebtedness. The amount of such 
guaranteed long-term debt and structured notes was $28.2 
billion and $16.4 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, 
respectively. 
The Firm’s unsecured debt does not contain requirements 
that would call for an acceleration of payments, maturities 
or changes in the structure of the existing debt, provide any 
limitations on future borrowings or require additional 
collateral, based on unfavorable changes in the Firm’s 
credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings or stock price.

Note 21 – Preferred stock
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, JPMorgan Chase was authorized to issue 200 million shares of preferred stock, in one or 
more series, with a par value of $1 per share. In the event of a liquidation or dissolution of the Firm, JPMorgan Chase’s 
preferred stock then outstanding takes precedence over the Firm’s common stock with respect to the payment of dividends 
and the distribution of assets.
The following is a summary of JPMorgan Chase’s non-cumulative preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and

Effective May 1, 2022, the Firm is authorized to purchase 
up to $30 billion of common shares under its common 
share repurchase program, which superseded the 
previously approved repurchase program under which the 
Firm was authorized to purchase up to $30 billion of 
common shares. In the second half of 2022, as a result of 
the expected increases in regulatory capital requirements, 
the Firm temporarily suspended share repurchases. In the 
first quarter of 2023, the Firm resumed repurchasing 
shares under its common share repurchase program.
The following table sets forth the Firm’s repurchases of 
common stock for the years ended December 31, 2022,

(a) As directed by the Federal Reserve, total net repurchases and common 
stock dividends in the first and second quarter of 2021 were restricted 
and could not exceed the average of the Firm’s net income for the four 
preceding calendar quarters. Effective July 1, 2021, the Firm became 
subject to the normal capital distribution restrictions provided under 
the regulatory capital framework.
(b) On March 15, 2020, in response to the economic disruptions caused 
by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm temporarily suspended 
repurchases of its common stock. Subsequently, the Federal Reserve 
directed all large banks, including the Firm, to discontinue net share 
repurchases through the end of 2020. 
The Board of Directors’ authorization to repurchase 
common shares is utilized at management’s discretion, and 
the timing of purchases and the exact amount of common 
shares that may be repurchased is subject to various 
factors, including market conditions; legal and regulatory 
considerations affecting the amount and timing of 
repurchase activity; the Firm’s capital position (taking into 
account goodwill and intangibles); internal capital 
generation; and alternative investment opportunities. The 
$30 billion common share repurchase program approved 
by the Board does not establish specific price targets or 
timetables. The repurchase program may be suspended by 
management at any time; and may be executed through 
open market purchases or privately negotiated 
transactions, or utilizing Rule 10b5-1 plans, which are 
written trading plans that the Firm may enter into from 
time to time under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934 and which allow the Firm to repurchase its 
common shares during periods when it may otherwise not 
be repurchasing common shares — for example, during 
internal trading blackout periods.
As of December 31, 2022, approximately 58.9 million 
shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under 
various employee incentive, compensation, option and 
stock purchase plans, and directors’ compensation plans.

Note 23 – Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated using the 
two-class method. Under the two-class method, all earnings 
(distributed and undistributed) are allocated to common 
stock and participating securities. JPMorgan Chase grants 
RSUs under its share-based compensation programs, 
predominantly all of which entitle recipients to receive 
nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a 
basis equivalent to dividends paid to holders of the Firm’s 
common stock. These unvested RSUs meet the definition of 
participating securities based on their respective rights to 
receive nonforfeitable dividends, and they are treated as a 
separate class of securities in computing basic EPS. 
Participating securities are not included as incremental 
shares in computing diluted EPS; refer to Note 9 for 
additional information.
Diluted EPS incorporates the potential impact of 
contingently issuable shares, including awards which 
require future service as a condition of delivery of the 
underlying common stock. Diluted EPS is calculated under 
both the two-class and treasury stock methods, and the 
more dilutive amount is reported. For each of the periods 
presented in the table below, diluted EPS calculated under 
the two-class method was more dilutive.
The following table presents the calculation of net income 
applicable to common stockholders and basic and diluted 
EPS for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 
2020.

other revenue related to the liquidation of certain legal entities, $38 million related to the net investment hedge gains and $46 million loss related to 
cumulative translation adjustment. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Firm reclassified a net pre-tax loss of $7 million. During the year 
ended December 31, 2020, the Firm reclassified net pre-tax gain of $6 million.
(c) Represents changes in fair value of cross-currency swaps attributable to changes in cross-currency basis spreads, which are excluded from the assessment

the accrual of interest on the cross-currency swap. 
(d) The pre-tax amounts are primarily recorded in noninterest revenue, net interest income and compensation expense in the Consolidated statements of 
income.
(e) During the year ended December 31, 2022, a remeasurement of the Firm’s U.S. principal defined benefit plan in the third quarter, was required as a result 
of a pension settlement. The remeasurement resulted in a net decrease of $1.4 billion in pre-tax AOCI. Refer to Note 8 for further information.

Note 25 – Income taxes 
JPMorgan Chase and its eligible subsidiaries file a 
consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. JPMorgan 
Chase uses the asset and liability method to provide for 
income taxes on all transactions recorded in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements. This method requires 
that income taxes reflect the expected future tax 
consequences of temporary differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book and tax 
purposes. Accordingly, a deferred tax asset or liability for 
each temporary difference is determined based on the tax 
rates that the Firm expects to be in effect when the 
underlying items of income and expense are realized. 

current and deferred portions of that expense. A valuation 
allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to 
the amount the Firm expects to realize.
Due to the inherent complexities arising from the nature of 
the Firm’s businesses, and from conducting business and 
being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions, 
significant judgments and estimates are required to be 
made. Agreement of tax liabilities between JPMorgan Chase 
and the many tax jurisdictions in which the Firm files tax 
returns may not be finalized for several years. Thus, the 
Firm’s final tax-related assets and liabilities may ultimately 
be different from those currently reported.

expense in the period in which the tax is incurred. At 
December 31, 2022 the income tax expense incurred was 
not material. 
Notes to consolidated financial statements

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Affordable housing tax credits
The Firm recognized $1.8 billion of tax credits and other tax 
benefits associated with investments in affordable housing 
projects within income tax expense for the year ended 
2022, and $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion for the years ended 
2021 and 2020, respectively. The amount of amortization 
of such investments reported in income tax expense was 
$1.4 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. The 
carrying value of these investments, which are reported in 
other assets on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets, was 
$12.1 billion and $10.8 billion at December 31, 2022 and 
2021, respectively. The amount of commitments related to 
these investments, which are reported in accounts payable 
and other liabilities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance 
sheets, was $5.4 billion and $4.6 billion at December 31, 
2022 and 2021, respectively. 
Deferred taxes 
Deferred income tax expense/(benefit) results from 
differences between assets and liabilities measured for 
financial reporting purposes versus income tax return 
purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in 
management’s judgment, their realizability is determined to 
be more likely than not. If a deferred tax asset is 
determined to be unrealizable, a valuation allowance is 
established. The significant components of deferred tax 
assets and liabilities are reflected in the following table.

JPMorgan Chase has recorded deferred tax assets of $365 
million at December 31, 2022, in connection with U.S. 
federal and non-U.S. NOL carryforwards and other tax 
attributes, FTC carryforwards, and state and local capital 
loss carryforwards. At December 31, 2022, total U.S. 
federal NOL carryforwards were $648 million, non-U.S. NOL 
carryforwards were $308 million, FTC carryforwards were 
$81 million, state and local capital loss carryforwards were 
$1.0 billion, and other U.S. federal tax attributes were 
$256 million. If not utilized, a portion of the U.S. federal 
NOL carryforwards and other U.S. federal tax attributes will 
expire between 2026 and 2037 whereas others have an 
unlimited carryforward period. Similarly, certain non-U.S. 
NOL carryforwards will expire between 2026 and 2039 
whereas others have an unlimited carryforward period. The 
FTC carryforwards will expire between 2029 and 2030, and 
the state and local capital loss carryforwards will expire in 
2026. 
The valuation allowance at December 31, 2022, was due to 
the state and local capital loss carryforwards, FTC 
carryforwards, and certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets, 
including NOL carryforwards.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Unrecognized tax benefits
At December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, JPMorgan Chase’s 
unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest 
expense and penalties, were $5.0 billion, $4.6 billion and 
$4.3 billion, respectively, of which $3.8 billion, $3.4 billion 
and $3.1 billion, respectively, if recognized, would reduce 
the annual effective tax rate. Included in the amount of 
unrecognized tax benefits are certain items that would not 
affect the effective tax rate if they were recognized in the 
Consolidated statements of income. These unrecognized 
items include the tax effect of certain temporary 
differences, the portion of gross state and local 
unrecognized tax benefits that would be offset by the 
benefit from associated U.S. federal income tax deductions, 
and the portion of gross non-U.S. unrecognized tax benefits 
that would have offsets in other jurisdictions. JPMorgan 
Chase evaluates the need for changes in unrecognized tax 
benefits based on its anticipated tax return filing positions 
as part of its U.S. federal and state and local tax returns. In 
addition, the Firm is presently under audit by a number of 
taxing authorities, most notably by the Internal Revenue 
Service, as summarized in the Tax examination status table 
below. The evaluation of unrecognized tax benefits as well 
as the potential for audit settlements make it reasonably 
possible that over the next 12 months the gross balance of 
unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease by as 
much as approximately $1.0 billion. The change in the 
unrecognized tax benefit would result in a payment or 
income statement recognition. 
The following table presents a reconciliation of the 
beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits.

2021 and 2020, respectively.
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, in addition to the liability 
for unrecognized tax benefits, the Firm had accrued $1.3 
billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, for income tax-related 
interest and penalties. 
Tax examination status
JPMorgan Chase is continually under examination by the 
Internal Revenue Service, by taxing authorities throughout 
the world, and by many state and local jurisdictions 
throughout the U.S. The following table summarizes the

Note 26 – Restricted cash, other restricted 
assets and intercompany funds transfers 
Restricted cash and other restricted assets 
Certain of the Firm’s cash and other assets are restricted as 
to withdrawal or usage. These restrictions are imposed by 
various regulatory authorities based on the particular 
activities of the Firm’s subsidiaries. 
The business of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to 
examination and regulation by the OCC. The Bank is a 
member of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, and its 
deposits in the U.S. are insured by the FDIC, subject to 
applicable limits. 
The Firm is required to maintain cash reserves at certain 
non-US central banks. 
The Firm is also subject to rules and regulations established 
by other U.S. and non U.S. regulators. As part of its 
compliance with the respective regulatory requirements, 
the Firm’s broker-dealer activities are subject to certain 
restrictions on cash and other assets. 
The following table presents the components of the Firm’s 
restricted cash: 
December 31, (in billions)

$1.4 billion and $1.3 billion in cash and due from banks on the 
Consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, 
respectively.
Also, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Firm had the 
following other restricted assets: 
• Cash and securities pledged with clearing organizations 
for the benefit of customers of $42.4 billion and $47.5 
billion, respectively. 
• Securities with a fair value of $31.7 billion and $30.0 
billion, respectively, were also restricted in relation to 
customer activity.
Intercompany funds transfers 
Restrictions imposed by U.S. federal law prohibit JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A., and its subsidiaries, from lending to 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“Parent Company”) and certain of 
its affiliates unless the loans are secured in specified 
amounts. Such secured loans provided by any banking 
subsidiary to the Parent Company or to any particular 
affiliate, together with certain other transactions with such 
affiliate (collectively referred to as “covered transactions”), 
must be made on terms and conditions that are consistent 
with safe and sound banking practices. In addition, unless 
collateralized with cash or US Government debt obligations, 
covered transactions are generally limited to 10% of the 
banking subsidiary’s total capital, as determined by the riskbased capital guidelines; the aggregate amount of covered 
transactions between any banking subsidiary and all of its 
affiliates is limited to 20% of the banking subsidiary’s total 
capital.
The Parent Company’s two principal subsidiaries are 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Holdings 
LLC, an intermediate holding company (the “IHC”). The IHC 
generally holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries 
other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. 
The IHC also owns other assets and provides intercompany 
loans to the Parent Company. The Parent Company is 
obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net 
proceeds received from securities issuances (including 
issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of 
preferred and common stock).
The principal sources of income and funding for the Parent 
Company are dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 
and dividends and extensions of credit from the IHC. In 
addition to dividend restrictions set forth in statutes and 
regulations, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have 
authority under the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act to 
prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking 
organizations they supervise, including the Parent Company 
and its subsidiaries that are banks or bank holding 
companies, if, in the banking regulator’s opinion, payment 
of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound 
practice in light of the financial condition of the banking 
organization. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or 
extending credit to the Parent Company if certain capital or 
liquidity “thresholds” are breached or if limits are otherwise 
imposed by the Parent Company’s management or Board of 
Directors.
At January 1, 2023, the Parent Company’s banking 
subsidiaries could pay, in the aggregate, approximately $34 
billion in dividends to their respective bank holding 
companies without the prior approval of their relevant 
banking regulators. The capacity to pay dividends in 2023 
will be supplemented by the banking subsidiaries’ earnings 
during the year.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Note 27 – Regulatory capital
The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, 
including well-capitalized requirements, for the 
consolidated financial holding company. The Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) establishes similar 
minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm’s 
principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 
The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital 
ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and 
internationally active U.S. bank holding companies and 
banks, including the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries, including 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Two comprehensive approaches 
are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized 
approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced 
approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the risk-based 
capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm and 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is evaluated against the lower of 
the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to 
their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements. 
The three components of regulatory capital under the Basel 
III rules are as illustrated below:
Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based guidelines 
of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to 
maintain minimum ratios for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, 
Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR. Failure to meet 
these minimum requirements could cause the Federal 
Reserve to take action. IDI subsidiaries are also subject to 
these capital requirements established by their respective 
primary regulators. 
The following table presents the risk-based regulatory 
capital ratio requirements and well-capitalized ratios to 
which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries were subject as of 
December 31, 2022 and 2021.

CECL regulatory capital transition
Until December 31, 2021, the Firm’s capital reflected a two 
year delay of the effects of CECL provided by the Federal 
Reserve Board in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Beginning January 1, 2022, the $2.9 billion CECL capital 
benefit is being phased out at 25% per year over a threeyear period. As of December 31, 2022, the Firm’s CET1 
capital reflected the remaining $2.2 billion benefit 
associated with the CECL capital transition provisions. 
Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, the Firm phased 
out 25% of the other CECL capital transition provisions 
which impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets, 
total leverage exposure and RWA, as applicable. 
Refer to Note 1 for further information on the CECL 
accounting guidance.
 
The following tables present risk-based capital metrics under both the Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced 
approaches and leverage-based capital metrics for JPMorgan Chase and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. As of December 31, 2022

Note 28 – Off–balance sheet lending-related 
financial instruments, guarantees, and 
other commitments
JPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial 
instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address 
the financing needs of its customers and clients. The 
contractual amount of these financial instruments 
represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm 
should the customer or client draw upon the commitment 
or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the 
guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently 
fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most 
of these commitments and guarantees have historically 
been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without 
being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total 
contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the 
Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit 
exposure or funding requirements. 
To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and 
certain consumer lending-related commitments, an 
allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments 
is maintained. Refer to Note 13 for further information 
regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related 
commitments. The following table summarizes the 
contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance 
sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and 
other commitments at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The 
amounts in the table below for credit card and home equity 
lending-related commitments represent the total available 
credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, 
and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for 
these products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm 
can reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by providing 
the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, 
without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit 
card lines when the borrower is 60 days or more past due. 
The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are 
significant decreases in the value of the underlying 
property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in 
the creditworthiness of the borrower.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

Other unfunded commitments to extend credit 
Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally 
consist of commitments for working capital and general 
corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support 
commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event 
that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new 
investors, as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing 
organizations. The Firm also issues commitments under 
multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in 
several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of 
credit. 
Guarantees 
U.S. GAAP requires that a guarantor recognize, at the 
inception of a guarantee, a liability in an amount equal to 
the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the 
guarantee. U.S. GAAP defines a guarantee as a contract that 
contingently requires the guarantor to pay a guaranteed 
party based upon: (a) changes in an underlying asset, 
liability or equity security of the guaranteed party; or (b) a 
third party’s failure to perform under a specified 
agreement. The Firm considers the following off–balance 
sheet arrangements to be guarantees under U.S. GAAP: 
standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees, 
securities lending indemnifications, certain indemnification 
agreements included within third-party contractual 
arrangements, certain derivative contracts and the 
guarantees under the sponsored member repo program. 
As required by U.S. GAAP, the Firm initially records 
guarantees at the inception date fair value of the noncontingent obligation assumed (e.g., the amount of 
consideration received or the net present value of the 
premium receivable). For these obligations, the Firm 
records this fair value amount in other liabilities with an 
offsetting entry recorded in cash (for premiums received), 
or other assets (for premiums receivable). Any premium 
receivable recorded in other assets is reduced as cash is 
received under the contract, and the fair value of the 
liability recorded at inception is amortized into income as 
lending and deposit-related fees over the life of the 
guarantee contract. The lending-related contingent 
obligation is recognized based on expected credit losses in 
addition to, and separate from, any non-contingent 
obligation.
Non-lending-related contingent obligations are recognized 
when the liability becomes probable and reasonably 
estimable. These obligations are not recognized if the 
estimated amount is less than the carrying amount of any 
non-contingent liability recognized at inception (adjusted 
for any amortization). Examples of non-lending-related 
contingent obligations include indemnifications provided in 
sales agreements, where a portion of the sale proceeds is 
allocated to the guarantee, which adjusts the gain or loss 
that would otherwise result from the transaction. For these 
indemnifications, the initial liability is amortized to income 
as the Firm’s risk is reduced (i.e., over time or when the 
indemnification expires).
The contractual amount and carrying value of guarantees 
and indemnifications are included in the table on page 277.
For additional information on the guarantees, see below. 
Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees 
Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are 
conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to 
guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a 
third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial 
paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, 
trade financings and similar transactions. 
The following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other financial 
guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Securities lending indemnifications 
Through the Firm’s securities lending program, 
counterparties’ securities, via custodial and non-custodial 
arrangements, may be lent to third parties. As part of this 
program, the Firm provides an indemnification in the 
lending agreements which protects the lender against the 
failure of the borrower to return the lent securities. To 
minimize its liability under these indemnification 
agreements, the Firm obtains cash or other highly liquid 
collateral with a market value exceeding 100% of the value 
of the securities on loan from the borrower. Collateral is 
marked to market daily to help assure that collateralization 
is adequate. Additional collateral is called from the 
borrower if a shortfall exists, or collateral may be released 
to the borrower in the event of overcollateralization. If a 
borrower defaults, the Firm would use the collateral held to 
purchase replacement securities in the market or to credit 
the lending client or counterparty with the cash equivalent 
thereof. 
The cash collateral held by the Firm may be invested on 
behalf of the client in indemnified resale agreements, 
whereby the Firm indemnifies the client against the loss of 
principal invested. To minimize its liability under these 
agreements, the Firm obtains collateral with a market value 
exceeding 100% of the principal invested.
Derivatives qualifying as guarantees 
The Firm transacts in certain derivative contracts that have 
the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. These 
contracts include written put options that require the Firm 
to purchase assets upon exercise by the option holder at a 
specified price by a specified date in the future. The Firm 
may enter into written put option contracts in order to meet 
client needs, or for other trading purposes. The terms of 
written put options are typically five years or less. 
Derivatives deemed to be guarantees also includes stable 
value contracts, commonly referred to as “stable value 
products”, that require the Firm to make a payment of the 
difference between the market value and the book value of 
a counterparty’s reference portfolio of assets in the event 
that market value is less than book value and certain other 
conditions have been met. Stable value products are 
transacted in order to allow investors to realize investment 
returns with less volatility than an unprotected portfolio. 
These contracts are typically longer-term or may have no 
stated maturity, but allow the Firm to elect to terminate the 
contract under certain conditions. 
The notional value of derivative guarantees generally 
represents the Firm’s maximum exposure. However, 
exposure to certain stable value products is contractually 
limited to a substantially lower percentage of the notional 
amount. 
The fair value of derivative guarantees reflects the 
probability, in the Firm’s view, of whether the Firm will be 
required to perform under the contract. The Firm reduces 
exposures to these contracts by entering into offsetting 
transactions, or by entering into contracts that hedge the 
market risk related to the derivative guarantees. 
The following table summarizes the derivatives qualifying 
as guarantees as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

In addition to derivative contracts that meet the 
characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser 
and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives 
market. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of credit 
derivatives. 
Unsettled securities financing agreements 
In the normal course of business, the Firm enters into resale 
and securities borrowed agreements. At settlement, these 
commitments result in the Firm advancing cash to and 
receiving securities collateral from the counterparty. The 
Firm also enters into repurchase and securities loaned 
agreements. At settlement, these commitments result in the 
Firm receiving cash from and providing securities collateral 
to the counterparty. Such agreements settle at a future 
date. These agreements generally do not meet the 
definition of a derivative, and therefore, are not recorded 
on the Consolidated balance sheets until settlement date. 
These agreements predominantly have regular-way 
settlement terms. Refer to Note 11 for a further discussion 
of securities financing agreements. 
Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications 
Mortgage repurchase liability 
In connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and 
securitization activities with U.S. GSEs the Firm has made 
representations and warranties that the loans sold meet 
certain requirements, and that may require the Firm to 
repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan 
purchaser if such representations and warranties are 
breached by the Firm. 
Private label securitizations
The liability related to repurchase demands associated with 
private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the 
Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. 
Refer to Note 30 for additional information regarding 
litigation. 
Loans sold with recourse 
The Firm provides servicing for mortgages and certain 
commercial lending products on both a recourse and 
nonrecourse basis. In nonrecourse servicing, the principal 
credit risk to the Firm is the cost of temporary servicing 
advances of funds (i.e., normal servicing advances). In 
recourse servicing, the servicer agrees to share credit risk 
with the owner of the mortgage loans, such as Fannie Mae 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

or Freddie Mac or a private investor, insurer or guarantor. 
Losses on recourse servicing predominantly occur when 
foreclosure sales proceeds of the property underlying a 
defaulted loan are less than the sum of the outstanding 
principal balance, plus accrued interest on the loan and the 
cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property. 
The Firm’s securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, 
thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit 
losses to the purchaser of the mortgage-backed securities 
issued by the trust. The unpaid principal balance of loans 
sold with recourse as well as the carrying value of the 
related liability that the Firm has recorded in accounts 
payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance 
sheets, which is representative of the Firm’s view of the 
likelihood it will have to perform under its recourse 
obligations, are disclosed in the table on page 277.
Other off-balance sheet arrangements 
Indemnification agreements – general 
In connection with issuing securities to investors outside the 
U.S., the Firm may agree to pay additional amounts to the 
holders of the securities in the event that, due to a change 
in tax law, certain types of withholding taxes are imposed 
on payments on the securities. The terms of the securities 
may also give the Firm the right to redeem the securities if 
such additional amounts are payable. The Firm may also 
enter into indemnification clauses in connection with the 
licensing of software to clients (“software licensees”) or 
when it sells a business or assets to a third party (“thirdparty purchasers”), pursuant to which it indemnifies 
software licensees for claims of liability or damages that 
may occur subsequent to the licensing of the software, or 
third-party purchasers for losses they may incur due to 
actions taken by the Firm prior to the sale of the business or 
assets. It is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum 
exposure under these indemnification arrangements, since 
this would require an assessment of future changes in tax 
law and future claims that may be made against the Firm 
that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical 
experience, management expects the risk of loss to be 
remote. 
Merchant charge-backs 
Under the rules of payment networks, in its role as a 
merchant acquirer, the Firm’s Merchant Services business 
in CIB Payments, retains a contingent liability for disputed 
processed credit and debit card transactions that result in a 
charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the 
cardholder’s favor, the Firm will (through the cardholder’s 
issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder 
and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If the 
Firm is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, the 
Firm will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded 
to the cardholder. The Firm mitigates this risk by 
withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve 
accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, the Firm 
recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment 
or performance risk related to charge-backs. 
For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, 
the Firm processed an aggregate volume of $2,158.4 
billion, $1,886.7 billion, and $1,597.3 billion, respectively.
Clearing Services – Client Credit Risk 
The Firm provides clearing services for clients by entering 
into securities purchases and sales and derivative contracts 
with CCPs, including ETDs such as futures and options, as 
well as OTC-cleared derivative contracts. As a clearing 
member, the Firm stands behind the performance of its 
clients, collects cash and securities collateral (margin) as 
well as any settlement amounts due from or to clients, and 
remits them to the relevant CCP or client in whole or part. 
There are two types of margin: variation margin is posted 
on a daily basis based on the value of clients’ derivative 
contracts and initial margin is posted at inception of a 
derivative contract, generally on the basis of the potential 
changes in the variation margin requirement for the 
contract. 
As a clearing member, the Firm is exposed to the risk of 
nonperformance by its clients, but is not liable to clients for 
the performance of the CCPs. Where possible, the Firm 
seeks to mitigate its risk to the client through the collection 
of appropriate amounts of margin at inception and 
throughout the life of the transactions. The Firm can also 
cease providing clearing services if clients do not adhere to 
their obligations under the clearing agreement. In the event 
of nonperformance by a client, the Firm would close out the 
client’s positions and access available margin. The CCP 
would utilize any margin it holds to make itself whole, with 
any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by the Firm as 
a clearing member. 
The Firm reflects its exposure to nonperformance risk of the 
client through the recognition of margin receivables from 
clients and margin payables to CCPs; the clients’ underlying 
securities or derivative contracts are not reflected in the 
Firm’s Consolidated Financial Statements. 
It is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum possible 
exposure through its role as a clearing member, as this 
would require an assessment of transactions that clients 
may execute in the future. However, based upon historical 
experience, and the credit risk mitigants available to the 
Firm, management believes it is unlikely that the Firm will 
have to make any material payments under these 
arrangements and the risk of loss is expected to be remote. 
Refer to Note 5 for information on the derivatives that the 
Firm executes for its own account and records in its 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Exchange & Clearing House Memberships 
The Firm is a member of several securities and derivative 
exchanges and clearing houses, both in the U.S. and other 
countries, and it provides clearing services to its clients. 
Membership in some of these organizations requires the 
Firm to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the 
organization as a result of the default of another member. 
Such obligations vary with different organizations. These 
obligations may be limited to the amount (or a multiple of 
the amount) of the Firm’s contribution to the guarantee 
fund maintained by a clearing house or exchange as part of 
the resources available to cover any losses in the event of a 
member default. Alternatively, these obligations may also 
include a pro rata share of the residual losses after applying 
the guarantee fund. Additionally, certain clearing houses 
require the Firm as a member to pay a pro rata share of 
losses that may result from the clearing house’s investment 
of guarantee fund contributions and initial margin, 
unrelated to and independent of the default of another 
member. Generally a payment would only be required 
should such losses exceed the resources of the clearing 
house or exchange that are contractually required to 
absorb the losses in the first instance. In certain cases, it is 
difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum possible exposure 
under these membership agreements, since this would 
require an assessment of future claims that may be made 
against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, 
based on historical experience, management expects the 
risk of loss to the Firm to be remote. Where the Firm’s 
maximum possible exposure can be estimated, the amount 
is disclosed in the table on page 277, in the Exchange & 
clearing house guarantees and commitments line. 
Sponsored member repo program 
The Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible 
overnight and term resale and repurchase agreements 
through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed 
Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf of clients 
that become sponsored members under the FICC’s rules. 
The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full 
payment and performance of its sponsored member clients’ 
respective obligations under the FICC’s rules. The Firm 
minimizes its liability under these guarantees by obtaining a 
security interest in the cash or high-quality securities 
collateral that the clients place with the clearing house; 
therefore, the Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. 
The Firm’s maximum possible exposure, without taking into 
consideration the associated collateral, is included in the 
Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments 
line on page 277. Refer to Note 11 for additional 
information on credit risk mitigation practices on resale 
agreements and the types of collateral pledged under 
repurchase agreements. 
Guarantees of subsidiaries 
In the normal course of business, the Parent Company may 
provide counterparties with guarantees of certain of the 
trading and other obligations of its subsidiaries on a 
contract-by-contract basis, as negotiated with the Firm’s 
counterparties. The obligations of the subsidiaries are 
included on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets or are 
reflected as off-balance sheet commitments; therefore, the 
Parent Company has not recognized a separate liability for 
these guarantees. The Firm believes that the occurrence of 
any event that would trigger payments by the Parent 
Company under these guarantees is remote. 
The Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt 
and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan 
Chase Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned 
finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully 
and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company and 
no other subsidiary of the parent company guarantees 
these securities. These guarantees, which rank on a parity 
with the Firm’s unsecured and unsubordinated 
indebtedness, are not included in the table on page 277 of 
this Note. Refer to Note 20 for additional information.

Note 29 – Pledged assets and collateral 
Pledged assets 
The Firm pledges financial assets that it owns to maintain 
potential borrowing capacity at discount windows with 
Federal Reserve banks, various other central banks and 
FHLBs. Additionally, the Firm pledges assets for other 
purposes, including to collateralize repurchase and other 
securities financing agreements, to cover short sales and to 
collateralize derivative contracts and deposits. Certain of 
these pledged assets may be sold or repledged or otherwise 
used by the secured parties and are parenthetically 
identified on the Consolidated balance sheets as assets 
pledged.
The following table presents the Firm’s pledged assets.

collateral is generally obtained under resale and other 
securities financing agreements, prime brokerage-related 
held-for-investment customer receivables and derivative 
contracts. Collateral is generally used under repurchase and 
other securities financing agreements, to cover short sales, 
and to collateralize derivative contracts and deposits.

Note 30 – Litigation
Contingencies 
As of December 31, 2022, the Firm and its subsidiaries and 
affiliates are defendants or respondents in numerous legal 
proceedings, including private, civil litigations, government 
investigations or regulatory enforcement matters. The 
litigations range from individual actions involving a single 
plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of 
class members. Investigations and regulatory enforcement 
matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by 
both governmental agencies and self-regulatory 
organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages 
of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve 
each of the Firm’s lines of business and several geographies 
and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort 
and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and 
consumer protection claims), some of which present novel 
legal theories.
The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of 
reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves 
established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to 
approximately $1.2 billion at December 31, 2022. This 
estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses 
was based upon information available as of that date for 
those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an 
estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For 
certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an 
estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate 
of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses 
involves significant judgment, given:
the number, variety and varying stages of the 
proceedings, including the fact that many are in 
preliminary stages, 
the existence in many such proceedings of multiple 
defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability 
(if any) has yet to be determined, 
the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the 
proceedings, including issues regarding class 
certification and the scope of many of the claims, and 
the uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of 
such proceedings, including where the Firm has made 
assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or 
other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of 
adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those 
assumptions prove to be incorrect.
In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be 
a result which the Firm did not take into account in its 
estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of 
that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s 
estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible 
losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may 
vary significantly.
Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal 
proceedings. 
1MDB Litigation. J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a 
defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia 
by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (“1MDB”), a Malaysian 
state-owned and controlled investment fund. J.P. Morgan 
(Suisse) SA was served in August 2022. The claim alleges 
“dishonest assistance” against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA in 
relation to payments of $300 million and $500 million, 
from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB 
and paid into an account at J.P. Morgan Suisse (SA) held by 
1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company 
between 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman) Limited. 
In September 2022, the Firm filed an application 
challenging the validity of service and the Malaysian court’s 
jurisdiction to hear the claim.
Amrapali. India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is 
investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in 
connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by 
two offshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase 
entities into residential housing projects developed by the 
Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”). In 2017, numerous creditors 
filed civil claims against Amrapali, including petitions 
brought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or 
failure to deliver residential units. The home buyers’ 
petitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court of India 
and are ongoing. In August 2021, the ED issued an order 
fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately 
$31.5 million. The Firm is appealing the order and the fine. 
Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued 
an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and 
other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities 
and the offshore funds that had invested in the projects, 
violated certain currency control and money laundering 
provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry 
under India’s Prevention of Money Laundering Act (“PMLA”) 
and Foreign Exchange Management Act (“FEMA”). In May 
2020, the ED attached approximately $25 million from J.P. 
Morgan India Private Limited in connection with the 
criminal PMLA investigation. The Firm is responding to and 
cooperating with the PMLA investigation. 
Federal Republic of Nigeria Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
N.A. operated an escrow and depository account for the 
Federal Government of Nigeria (“FGN”) and two major 
international oil companies. The account held 
approximately $1.1 billion in connection with a dispute 
among the clients over rights to an oil field. Following the 
settlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid 
out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in 
accordance with directions received from its clients. In 
November 2017, the Federal Republic of Nigeria (“FRN”) 
commenced a claim in the English High Court for 
approximately $875 million in payments made out of the 
accounts. The FRN alleged that the payments were 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

instructed as part of a complex fraud not involving 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but that JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
N.A. was or should have been on notice that the payments 
may be fraudulent. A trial was held between February and 
April 2022. In June 2022, the Court decided the case in 
favor of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dismissed it in full. 
In November 2022, the Court refused permission to the 
FRN to appeal the dismissal, and the matter was concluded.
Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm 
previously reported settlements with certain government 
authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and 
trading activities and controls related to those activities. 
Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded 
guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The 
Department of Labor ("DOL") granted the Firm exemptions 
that permit the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on 
the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under 
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) 
through the ten-year disqualification period following the 
antitrust plea. The only remaining FX-related governmental 
inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission matter 
which is currently pending before the South Africa 
Competition Tribunal.
With respect to civil litigation matters, in August 2018, the 
United States District Court for the Southern District of New 
York granted final approval to the Firm’s settlement of a 
consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs, 
which principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws 
based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign 
exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of 
persons who transacted in FX futures and options on 
futures. Although certain members of the settlement class 
filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, an 
agreement to resolve their claims was reached in December 
2022. A putative class action remains pending against the 
Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of 
certain consumers who purchased foreign currencies at 
allegedly inflated rates. In addition, some FX-related 
individual and putative class actions based on similar 
alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S., 
including in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and 
Australia. An agreement to resolve one of the UK actions 
was reached in December 2022. In a putative class action 
pending before the U.K. Competition Appeal Tribunal, 
proposed class representatives have appealed the tribunal's 
denial of a request for class certification on an opt-out 
basis. In Israel, a settlement in principle has been reached 
in the putative class action, which remains subject to court 
approval.
Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail 
associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging 
that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, 
conspired to set the price of credit and debit card 
interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of 
antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases 
for a cash payment, but that settlement was reversed on 
appeal and remanded to the United States District Court for 
the Eastern District of New York.
The original class action was divided into two separate 
actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other 
seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the 
parties to the monetary class action finalized an agreement 
which amends and supersedes the prior settlement 
agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants 
collectively contributed an additional $900 million to the 
approximately $5.3 billion previously held in escrow from 
the original settlement. In December 2019, the amended 
settlement agreement was approved by the District Court. 
Certain merchants appealed the District Court’s approval 
order, and those appeals are pending. Based on the 
percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended 
class settlement, $700 million has been returned to the 
defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with 
the settlement agreement. The injunctive class action 
continues separately, and in September 2021, the District 
Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in 
part, and denied the motion in part.
Of the merchants who opted out of the amended damages 
class settlement, certain merchants filed individual actions 
raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as 
well as against the Firm and other banks. While some of 
those actions remain pending, the defendants have reached 
settlements with the merchants who opted out representing 
over half of the combined Mastercard-branded and Visabranded payment card sales volume. 
Jeffrey Epstein Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is 
named as a defendant in two lawsuits filed in the United 
States District Court for the Southern District of New York 
which allege that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. knowingly 
facilitated Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking and other 
unlawful conduct by providing banking services to Epstein 
until 2013. One case, which was filed in November 2022, is 
a putative class action filed by an alleged sex-trafficking 
victim of Epstein, and the other case, which was filed in 
December 2022, was brought on behalf of the government 
of the United States Virgin Islands and also alleges certain 
Virgin Islands statutory claims. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 
has moved to dismiss both complaints.
LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and 
Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from 
various governmental agencies and entities around the 
world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s 
(“BBA”) London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for 
various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s 
Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss 
Competition Commission’s investigation relating to 
EURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other bank remain 
subject, continues. In December 2016, the European 
Commission issued a decision against the Firm and other 
banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules 
relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that 
Notes to consolidated financial statements

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

decision with the European General Court, and that appeal 
is pending.
In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along 
with other banks in various individual and putative class 
actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar 
LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the 
period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has 
obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain 
other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation. 
The United States District Court for the Southern District of 
New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims 
related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the 
defendants, including the Firm. A consolidated putative 
class action related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was 
administered by ICE Benchmark Administration has been 
dismissed. In addition, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a 
lawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and 
other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement 
to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the 
market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards. In 
September 2022, the Court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint 
in its entirety, and plaintiffs filed an amended complaint 
asserting similar antitrust claims, which defendants have 
moved to dismiss. The Firm’s settlements of putative class 
actions related to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and 
the Singapore Swap Offer Rate, and the Australian Bank Bill 
Swap Reference Rate received final court approval in 
November 2022, while the settlement related to Swiss 
franc LIBOR remains subject to court approval. 
Securities Lending Antitrust Litigation. JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, 
Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are 
named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the 
United States District Court for the Southern District of New 
York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust 
law and New York State common law in connection with an 
alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous 
exchange trading for securities lending transactions. 
Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint was denied. 
Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this action, which 
defendants are opposing.
Shareholder Litigation. Several shareholder putative class 
actions, as well as shareholder derivative actions purporting 
to act on behalf of the Firm, have been filed against the 
Firm, its Board of Directors and certain of its current and 
former officers. 
Certain of these shareholder suits relate to historical 
trading practices by former employees in the precious 
metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct 
which were the subject of the Firm’s resolutions with the 
DOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020, and fiduciary 
activities that were separately the subject of a resolution 
between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in 
November 2020. One of these shareholder derivative suits 
was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in 
May 2022, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust 
enrichment claims relating to the historical trading 
practices and related conduct and fiduciary activities which 
were the subject of the resolutions described above. In 
December 2022, the court granted defendants’ motion to 
dismiss this action in full. A second shareholder derivative 
action was filed in the United States District Court for the 
Eastern District of New York in December 2022 relating to 
the historical trading practices and related conduct, which 
asserts breach of fiduciary duty and contribution claims and 
alleges that the shareholder is excused from making a 
demand to commence litigation because such a demand 
would have been futile. In addition, a consolidated putative 
class action is pending in the United States District Court for 
the Eastern District of New York on behalf of shareholders 
who acquired shares of JPMorgan Chase common stock 
during the putative class period, alleging that certain SEC 
filings of the Firm were materially false or misleading 
because they did not disclose certain information relating to 
the historical trading practices and conduct. Defendants 
have moved to dismiss the amended complaint in this 
action. 
A separate shareholder derivative suit was filed in March 
2022 in the United States District Court for the Eastern 
District of New York asserting breaches of fiduciary duty 
and violations of federal securities laws based on the 
alleged failure of the Board of Directors to exercise 
adequate oversight over the Firm’s compliance with records 
preservation requirements which were the subject of 
resolutions between certain of the Firm’s subsidiaries and 
the SEC and the CFTC. Defendants’ motion to dismiss the 
amended complaint is pending. 
* * *
In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed 
above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as 
defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial 
number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has 
meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its 
currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to 
defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may 
be initiated from time to time in the future.
The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its 
currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with 
the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm 
accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable 
that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of 
the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its 
outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its 
litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, 
upward or downward, as appropriate, based on 
management’s best judgment after consultation with 
counsel. The Firm’s legal expense was $266 million, $426 
million and $1.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 
2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There is no assurance 
that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be 
adjusted in the future. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome 
of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek 
very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters 
present novel legal theories, involve a large number of 
parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot 
state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of 
the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate 
resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or 
consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase 
believes, based upon its current knowledge and after 
consultation with counsel, consideration of the material 
legal proceedings described above and after taking into 
account its current litigation reserves and its estimated 
aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal 
proceedings currently pending against it should not have a 
material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial 
condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the 
uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no 
assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will 
not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently 
accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational 
consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular 
matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating 
results for a particular period, depending on, among other 
factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level 
of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period.

Note 31 – International operations
The following table presents income statement and balance 
sheet-related information for JPMorgan Chase by major 
international geographic area. The Firm defines 
international activities for purposes of this footnote 
presentation as business transactions that involve clients 
residing outside of the U.S., and the information presented 
below is based predominantly on the domicile of the client, 
the location from which the client relationship is managed, 
booking location or the location of the trading desk. 
However, many of the Firm’s U.S. operations serve 
international businesses.
As the Firm’s operations are highly integrated, estimates 
and subjective assumptions have been made to apportion 
revenue and expense between U.S. and international 
operations. These estimates and assumptions are consistent 
with the allocations used for the Firm’s segment reporting 
as set forth in Note 32.
The Firm’s long-lived assets for the periods presented are 
not considered by management to be significant in relation 
to total assets. The majority of the Firm’s long-lived assets 
are located in the U.S.

Segment results 
The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s 
segment results as of or for the years ended December 31, 
2022, 2021 and 2020, on a managed basis. The Firm’s 
definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. 
GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to 
present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the 
reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. 
Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax 
credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the 
managed results on a basis comparable to taxable 
investments and securities. This allows management to 
assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year 
arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The 
corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt 
items is recorded within income tax expense/(benefit). 
These adjustments have no impact on net income as 
reported by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs.
Capital allocation
Each business segment is allocated capital by taking into 
consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of 
similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital 
requirements. ROE is measured and internal targets for 
expected returns are established as key measures of a 
business segment’s performance.
The Firm’s allocation methodology incorporates Basel III 
Standardized RWA, Basel III Advanced RWA, the GSIB 
surcharge, and a simulation of capital in a severe stress 
environment. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments 
and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed 
and, as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may 
change.

Consolidated average balance sheets, interest and rates
Provided below is a summary of JPMorgan Chase’s 
consolidated average balances, interest and rates on a 
taxable-equivalent basis for the years 2020 through 2022. 
Income computed on a taxable-equivalent basis is the 
income reported in the Consolidated statements of income, 
adjusted to present interest income and rates earned on 
assets exempt from income taxes (i.e., federal taxes) on a 
basis comparable with other taxable investments. The 
incremental tax rate used for calculating the taxableequivalent adjustment was approximately 24% in 2022, 
2021 and 2020.

The table below presents an attribution of net interest income between volume and rate. The attribution between volume and rate 
is calculated using annual average balances for each category of assets and liabilities shown in the table and the corresponding 
annual rates (refer to pages 292-296 for more information on average balances and rates). In this analysis, when the change 
cannot be isolated to either volume or rate, it has been allocated to volume. The annual rates include the impact of changes in 
market rates, as well as the impact of any change in composition of the various products within each category of asset or liability. 
This analysis is calculated separately for each category without consideration of the relationship between categories (for example, 
the net spread between the rates earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities that fund those assets). As a result, changes in 
the granularity or groupings considered in this analysis would produce a different attribution result, and due to the complexities 
involved, precise allocation of changes in interest rates between volume and rates is inherently complex and judgmental.

another party (the protection seller). Upon the occurrence 
of a credit event by the reference entity, which may include, 
among other events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its 
obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of the 
reference entity, neither party has recourse to the 
reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to 
the protection seller for the difference between the face 
value of the CDS contract and the fair value at the time of 
settling the credit derivative contract. The determination as 
to whether a credit event has occurred is generally made by 
the relevant International Swaps and Derivatives 
Association (“ISDA”) Determinations Committee.

Embedded derivatives: are implicit or explicit terms or 
features of a financial instrument that affect some or all of 
the cash flows or the value of the instrument in a manner 
similar to a derivative. An instrument containing such terms 
or features is referred to as a “hybrid.” The component of 
the hybrid that is the non-derivative instrument is referred 
to as the “host.” For example, callable debt is a hybrid 
instrument that contains a plain vanilla debt instrument 
(i.e., the host) and an embedded option that allows the 
issuer to redeem the debt issue at a specified date for a 
specified amount (i.e., the embedded derivative). However, 
a floating rate instrument is not a hybrid composed of a 
fixed-rate instrument and an interest rate swap.

LTV: “Loan-to-value”: For residential real estate loans, the 
relationship, expressed as a percentage, between the 
principal amount of a loan and the appraised value of the 
collateral (i.e., residential real estate) securing the loan. 
Origination date LTV ratio 
The LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan. Origination 
date LTV ratios are calculated based on the actual 
appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the 
origination date. 
Current estimated LTV ratio 
An estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current 
estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated 
collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home 
price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area 
(“MSA”) level. These MSA-level home price indices consist 
of actual data to the extent available and forecasted data 
where actual data is not available. As a result, the 
estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do 
not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; 
as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise 
and should therefore be viewed as estimates. 
Combined LTV ratio 
The LTV ratio considering all available lien positions, as well 
as unused lines, related to the property. Combined LTV 
ratios are used for junior lien home equity products.

Mortgage origination channels:
Retail – Borrowers who buy or refinance a home through 
direct contact with a mortgage banker employed by the 
Firm using a branch office, the Internet or by phone. 
Borrowers are frequently referred to a mortgage banker by 
a banker in a Chase branch, real estate brokers, home 
builders or other third parties.
Correspondent – Banks, thrifts, other mortgage banks and 
other financial institutions that sell closed loans to the Firm.
Mortgage product types: 
Alt-A 
Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than 
subprime loans but have characteristics that would 
disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A 
lending characteristics may include one or more of the 
following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio; 
(iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) 
a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial 
proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a 
borrower does not provide complete documentation of his 
or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income. 
Option ARMs 
The option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustablerate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the 
option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only 
or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option 
ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the 
introductory period. This introductory rate is usually 
significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed 
rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once 
the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate 
charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and 
adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The 
minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest 
accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is 
deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. 
Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which 
converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan 
upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date 
triggers. 
Prime 
Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good 
credit records who meet specific underwriting 
requirements, including prescriptive requirements related 
to income and overall debt levels. New prime mortgage 
borrowers provide full documentation and generally have 
reliable payment histories. 
Subprime 
Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were 
offered to certain customers with one or more high risk 
characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or 
poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than 
80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a 
high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the 
loan is other than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) 
a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.

Net interchange income includes the following 
components:
• Interchange income: Fees earned by credit and debit 
card issuers on sales transactions. 
• Reward costs: The cost to the Firm for points earned by 
cardholders enrolled in credit card rewards programs 
generally tied to sales transactions.
• Partner payments: Payments to co-brand credit card 
partners based on the cost of loyalty program rewards 
earned by cardholders on credit card transactions.

which is recognized over the period in which the service is 
provided; changes in the fair value of MSRs; the impact of 
risk management activities associated with MSRs; and gains 
and losses on securitization of excess mortgage servicing. 
Net mortgage servicing revenue also includes gains and 
losses on sales and lower of cost or fair value adjustments 
of certain repurchased loans insured by U.S. government 
agencies.

NM: Not meaningful
NOL: Net operating loss 
Nonaccrual loans: Loans for which interest income is not 
recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than credit 
card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. 
government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status 
when full payment of principal and interest is not expected, 
regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and 
interest have been in default for a period of 90 days or 
more unless the loan is both well-secured and in the 
process of collection. Collateral-dependent loans are 
typically maintained on nonaccrual status. 
Nonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include 
nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and certain 
assets acquired in loan satisfaction, predominantly real 
estate owned and other commercial and personal property.

that are negotiated, executed and settled bilaterally 
between two derivative counterparties, where one or both 
counterparties is a derivatives dealer. 
Over-the-counter cleared (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives: 
Derivative contracts that are negotiated and executed 
bilaterally, but subsequently settled via a central clearing 
house, such that each derivative counterparty is only 
exposed to the default of that clearing house. 
Overhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage of 
total net revenue.
Parent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Participating securities: Represents unvested share-based 
compensation awards containing nonforfeitable rights to 
dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively, 
“dividends”), which are included in the earnings per share 
calculation using the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase 
grants RSUs to certain employees under its share-based 
compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to 
receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period 
on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of 
common stock. These unvested awards meet the definition 
of participating securities. Under the two-class method, all 
earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to 
each class of common stock and participating securities, 
based on their respective rights to receive dividends. 
PCA: Prompt corrective action

disclosure requirements which allow market participants to 
assess the risk and capital profiles of banks.
PPP: Paycheck Protection Program under the Small 
Business Association (“SBA”)
PRA: Prudential Regulation Authority 
Pre-provision profit/(loss): Represents total net revenue 
less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this 
financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a 
lending institution to generate income in excess of its 
provision for credit losses.
Pre-tax margin: Represents income before income tax 
expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in 
management’s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax 
performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs 
are taken into consideration. It is one basis upon which 
management evaluates the performance of AWM against 
the performance of their respective competitors.
Principal transactions revenue: Principal transactions 
revenue is driven by many factors, including: 
• the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the 
price at which a market participant is willing and able to 
sell an instrument to the Firm and the price at which 
another market participant is willing and able to buy it 
from the Firm, and vice versa; and 
• realized and unrealized gains and losses on financial 
instruments and commodities transactions, including 
those accounted for under the fair value option, primarily 
used in client-driven market-making activities, and on 
private equity investments. 
– Realized gains and losses result from the sale of 
instruments, closing out or termination of transactions, 
or interim cash payments. 
– Unrealized gains and losses result from changes in 
valuation. 
In connection with its client-driven market-making 
activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity 
instruments, derivatives and commodities, including 
Glossary of Terms and Acronyms
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K

physical commodities inventories and financial instruments 
that reference commodities. 
Principal transactions revenue also includes realized and 
unrealized gains and losses related to: 
• derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting 
relationships, primarily fair value hedges of commodity 
and foreign exchange risk; 
• derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, 
primarily to mitigate credit, foreign exchange and 
interest rate risks.
Production revenue: Includes fees and income recognized 
as earned on mortgage loans originated with the intent to 
sell, and the impact of risk management activities 
associated with the mortgage pipeline and warehouse 
loans. Production revenue also includes gains and losses on 
sales and lower of cost or fair value adjustments on 
mortgage loans held-for-sale (excluding certain 
repurchased loans insured by U.S. government agencies), 
and changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
measured under the fair value option.
PSUs: Performance share units

comprehensive approaches for calculating RWA (a 
Standardized approach and an Advanced approach) which 
include capital requirements for credit risk, market risk, and 
in the case of Basel III Advanced, also operational risk. Key 
differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between 
the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for 
Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive 
approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit 
models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, 
credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory riskweightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and 
asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally 
consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III 
Advanced.

indexes or non-traditional uses of traditional interest rates 
or indexes. 
Taxable-equivalent basis: In presenting results on a 
managed basis, the total net revenue for each of the 
business segments and the Firm is presented on a taxequivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments
