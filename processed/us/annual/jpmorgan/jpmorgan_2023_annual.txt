Dear Fellow Shareholders,
Across the globe, 2023 was yet another year of significant challenges, from the 
terrible ongoing wars and violence in the Middle East and Ukraine to mounting 
terrorist activity and growing geopolitical tensions, importantly with China. Almost 
all nations felt the effects last year of global economic uncertainty, including higher 
energy and food prices, inflation rates and volatile markets. While all these events 
and associated instability have serious ramifications on our company, colleagues, 
clients and countries where we do business, their consequences on the world at large 
— with the extreme suffering of the Ukrainian people, escalating tragedy in the Middle 
East and the potential restructuring of the global order — are far more important. 
As these events unfold, America’s global leadership role is being challenged outside 
by other nations and inside by our polarized electorate. We need to find ways to put 
aside our differences and work in partnership with other Western nations in the name 
of democracy. During this time of great crises, uniting to protect our essential 
freedoms, including free enterprise, is paramount. We should remember that 
America, “conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are 
Jamie Dimon, 
Chairman and 
Chief Executive 
Officer

created equal,” still remains a shining beacon of hope to citizens around the world. 
JPMorgan Chase, a company that historically has worked across borders and 
boundaries, will do its part to ensure that the global economy is safe and secure. 
In spite of the unsettling landscape, including last year’s regional bank turmoil, the 
U.S. economy continues to be resilient, with consumers still spending, and the 
markets currently expect a soft landing. It is important to note that the economy is 
being fueled by large amounts of government deficit spending and past stimulus. 
There is also a growing need for increased spending as we continue transitioning to 
a greener economy, restructuring global supply chains, boosting military expenditure 
and battling rising healthcare costs. This may lead to stickier inflation and higher 
rates than markets expect. Furthermore, there are downside risks to watch. 
Quantitative tightening is draining more than $900 billion in liquidity from the system 
annually — and we have never truly experienced the full effect of quantitative 
tightening on this scale. Plus the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East 
continue to have the potential to disrupt energy and food markets, migration, and 
military and economic relationships, in addition to their dreadful human cost. These 
significant and somewhat unprecedented forces cause us to remain cautious. 
2023 was another strong year for JPMorgan Chase, with our firm generating record 
revenue for the sixth consecutive year, as well as setting numerous records in each 
of our lines of business. We earned revenue in 2023 of $162.4 billion1 and net income 
of $49.6 billion, with return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) of 21%, reflecting 
strong underlying performance across our businesses. We also increased our 
quarterly common dividend of $1.00 per share to $1.05 per share in the third quarter 
of 2023 — and again to $1.15 per share in the first quarter of 2024 — while continuing 
to reinforce our fortress balance sheet. We grew market share in several of our 
businesses and continued to make significant investments in products, people and 
technology while exercising strict risk disciplines. 
Throughout the year, we demonstrated the power of our investment philosophy and 
guiding principles, as well as the value of being there for clients — as we always are — 
in both good times and bad times. The result was continued growth broadly across 
the firm. We will highlight a few examples from 2023: Consumer & Community 
Banking (CCB) extended its #1 leadership positions and grew share year-over-year in 
retail deposits, credit card sales and credit card outstandings (adding close to 3.6 
million net new customers to the franchise); the Corporate & Investment Bank (CIB) 
1 Represents managed revenue.

maintained its #1 rank in both Investment Banking and Markets and gained more 
than 100 basis points of Investment Banking market share; Commercial Banking (CB) 
added over 5,000 new relationships (excluding First Republic Bank), roughly doubling 
the prior year’s achievement; and Asset & Wealth Management (AWM) saw record 
client asset net inflows of $490 billion, over 20% higher than its prior record.
In 2023, we continued to play a forceful and essential role in advancing economic 
growth. In total, we extended credit and raised capital totaling $2.3 trillion for our 
consumer and institutional clients around the world. On a daily basis, we move nearly 
$10 trillion in over 120 currencies and more than 160 countries, as well as safeguard 
over $32 trillion in assets. By purchasing First Republic Bank, we brought muchneeded stability to the U.S. banking system while allowing us to give a new, secure 
home to over half a million First Republic customers.
As always, we hold fast to our commitment to corporate responsibility, including 
helping to create a stronger, more inclusive economy — from supporting work skills 
training programs around the world to financing affordable housing and small 
businesses to making investments in cities like Detroit that show how business and 
government leaders can work together to solve problems. 
We have achieved our decades-long consistency by adhering to our key principles and 
strategies (see sidebar on Steadfast Principles on page 5), which allow us to drive 
good organic growth and promote proper management of our capital (including 
dividends and stock buybacks). The charts on pages 9–15 show our performance 
results and illustrate how we have grown our franchises, how we compare with our 
competitors and how we look at our fortress balance sheet. Please peruse them and 
the CEO letters in this Annual Report, all of which provide specific details about our 
businesses and our plans for the future. 
I remain proud of our company’s resiliency and of what our hundreds of thousands of 
employees around the world have achieved, collectively and individually. Throughout 
these challenging past few years, we have never stopped doing all the things we should 
be doing to serve our clients and our communities. As you know, we are champions of 
banking’s essential role in a community — its potential for bringing people together, for 
enabling companies and individuals to attain their goals, and for being a source of 
strength in difficult times. I often remind our employees that the work we do matters 

STEADFAST PRINCIPLES WORTH REPEATING (AND ONE NEW ONE)
Looking back on the past two+ decades — 
starting from my time as Chairman and 
CEO of Bank One in 2000 — there is one 
common theme: our unwavering dedication to help clients, communities and 
countries throughout the world. It is clear 
that our financial discipline, constant 
investment in innovation and ongoing 
development of our people have enabled 
us to achieve this consistency and commitment. In addition, across the firm, we 
uphold certain steadfast tenets that are 
worth repeating. 
First, our work has very real human 
impact. While JPMorgan Chase stock is 
owned by large institutions, pension 
plans, mutual funds and directly by single 
investors, in almost all cases the ultimate 
beneficiaries are individuals in our communities. More than 100 million people in 
the United States own stocks; many, in 
one way or another, own JPMorgan Chase 
stock. Frequently, these shareholders are 
veterans, teachers, police officers, firefighters, healthcare workers, retirees, or 
those saving for a home, education or 
retirement. Often, our employees also 
bank these shareholders, as well as their 
families and their companies. Your management team goes to work every day 
recognizing the enormous responsibility 
that we have to all of our shareholders. 
Second, shareholder value can be built 
only if you maintain a healthy and vibrant 
company, which means doing a good job 
of taking care of your customers, employees and communities. Conversely, how 
can you have a healthy company if you 
neglect any of these stakeholders? As we 
have learned over the past few years, 
there are myriad ways an institution can 
demonstrate its compassion for its 
employees and its communities while still 
strengthening shareholder value.
Third, while we don’t run the company 
worrying about the stock price in the short 
run, in the long run we consider our stock 
price a measure of our progress over time. 
This progress is a function of continual 
investments in our people, systems and 
products, in good and bad times, to build 
our capabilities. These important investments will also drive our company’s future 
prospects and position it to grow and 
prosper for decades. Measured by stock 
performance, our progress is exceptional. 
For example, whether looking back 10 
years or even farther to 2004, when the 
JPMorgan Chase/Bank One merger took 
place, we have outperformed the Standard 
& Poor’s 500 Index and the Standard & 
Poor’s Financials Index. 
Fourth, we are united behind basic principles and strategies (you can see the principles for How We Do Business on our 
website and our Purpose statement in my 
letter from last year) that have helped 
build this company and made it thrive. 
These allow us to maintain a fortress balance sheet, constantly invest and nurture 
talent, fully satisfy regulators, continually 
improve risk, governance and controls, 
and serve customers and clients while 
lifting up communities worldwide. This 
philosophy is embedded in our company 
culture and influences nearly every role 
in the firm. 
Fifth, we strive to build enduring businesses, which rely on and benefit from one 
another, but we are not a conglomerate. 
This structure helps generate our superior 
returns. Nonetheless, despite our best 
efforts, the walls that protect this company are not particularly high — and we 
face extraordinary competition. I have 
written about this reality extensively in the 
past and cover it again in this letter. We 
recognize our strengths and vulnerabilities, and we play our hand as best we can.
Sixth, and this is the new one, we must be 
a source of strength, particularly in tough 
times, for our clients and the countries in 
which we operate. We must take seriously 
our role as one of the guardians of the 
world’s financial systems.
Seventh, we operate with a very important 
silent partner — the U.S. government — 
noting as my friend Warren Buffett points 
out that his company’s success is predicated upon the extraordinary conditions 
our country creates. He is right to say to 
his shareholders that when they see the 
American flag, they all should say thank 
you. We should, too. JPMorgan Chase is a 
healthy and thriving company, and we 
always want to give back and pay our fair 
share. We do pay our fair share — and we 
want it to be spent well and have the 
greatest impact. To give you an idea of 
where our taxes and fees go: In the last 10 
years, we paid more than $46 billion in 
federal, state and local taxes in the United 
States and over $22 billion in taxes outside 
of the United States. Additionally, we paid 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
over $10 billion so that it has the resources 
to cover failure in the American banking 
sector. Our partner — the federal government — also imposes significant regulations upon us, and it is imperative that we 
meet all legal and regulatory requirements imposed on our company. 
Eighth and finally, we know the foundation of our success rests with our people. 
They are the front line, both individually 
and as teams, serving our customers and 
communities, building the technology, 
making the strategic decisions, managing 
the risks, determining our investments 
and driving innovation. However you view 
the world — its complexity, risks and 
opportunities — a company’s prosperity 
requires a great team of people with 
guts, brains, integrity, enormous capabilities and high standards of professional 
excellence to ensure its ongoing success.

MAPPING OUR PROGRESS AND MILESTONES

ffi

and has impact. United by our principles and purpose, we help people and institutions 
finance and achieve their aspirations, lifting up individuals, homeowners, small 
businesses, larger corporations, schools, hospitals, cities and countries in all regions 
of the world. What we have accomplished in the 20 years since the Bank One and 
JPMorgan Chase merger is evidence of the importance of our values.
CELEBRATING THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BANK ONE/JPMORGAN CHASE 
MERGER
J.P. Morgan Chase
By 2004, J.P. Morgan Chase already represented the consolidation of four of the 10 
largest U.S. banks from 1990: The Chase Manhattan Corp., Manufacturers Hanover, 
Chemical Banking Corp. and, most recently, J.P. Morgan & Company. And some of their 
predecessor companies stretched back into the 1800s, one even into the late 1700s.
Bank One
Bank One had been even busier on the acquisition front, especially across the United 
States. By 1998, then Banc One had more than 1,300 branches in 12 states when it 
announced a merger with First Chicago NBD, a Chicago-based bank created just 
three years earlier by the merger of First Chicago and Detroit-based NBD. Now 
headquartered in Chicago, the new Bank One became the largest bank in the 
Midwest, second largest among credit card companies and fourth largest in the 
United States. But the merger didn’t go as planned, with Bank One issuing three 
different earnings warnings. In March 2000, Bank One reached outside its executive 
ranks, and my tenure began as Chairman and CEO, working to overhaul the company 
and help bring it back to profitability and growth. 
The story begins ... A merger 20 years ago helped transform two giant banks
Fast forward to 2003, and another wave of consolidation was well underway in U.S. 
banking. Most of the nation’s larger banks were trying to position themselves to be an 
“endgame winner.” In the biggest deal, Bank of America agreed to buy FleetBoston 
Financial Corp. for more than $40 billion. Those two banks — already amalgamations 
of several predecessor companies — touted the breadth of their combined retail 
branch network.

But they were hardly alone. In 2003, some 215 deals were announced among 
U.S. commercial banks and bank holding companies for a total value of $66 billion, 
according to Thomson Financial, which tracks merger data.
In July 2004, J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank One merged — as part of a 225-year 
journey — to form this exceptional company of ours: JPMorgan Chase. At its merger 
in 2004, the combined bank was the fourth largest bank in the world by market 
capitalization. But with patient groundwork over the years — fixing systems and 
upgrading technology, managing the notable acquisitions of Bear Stearns and 
Washington Mutual (WaMu) and continuing to reinvest, including in our talent — 
we have made our company an endgame winner. 
In earlier years, banks worried about their survival. While the past two decades have 
brought some virtually unprecedented challenges, including the great financial crisis 
and a pandemic followed by a global shutdown, they did not stop us from 
accomplishing extraordinary things. Our bank has now emerged as the #1 bank by 
market capitalization. 
Each of our businesses is among the best in the world, with increased market share, 
strong financial results and an unwavering focus on serving our clients, communities 
and shareholders with distinction and dedication. The strengths that are embedded in 
JPMorgan Chase — the knowledge and cohesiveness of our people, our long-standing 
client relationships, our technology and product capabilities, our presence in more 
than 100 countries and our unquestionable fortress balance sheet — would be hard to 
replicate. Crucially, the strength of our company has allowed us to always be there for 
clients, governments and communities — in good times and in bad times — and this 
strength has enabled us to continually invest in building our businesses for the future.
You can see from the following charts what gains and improvements we have 
achieved along the way.

Update on Specific Issues Facing 
Our Company
Each year, I try to update you on some of the most 
important issues facing our company. First and 
foremost may well be the impact of artificial intelligence (AI).
While we do not know the full effect or the precise 
rate at which AI will change our business — or how 
it will affect society at large — we are completely 
convinced the consequences will be extraordinary 
and possibly as transformational as some of the 
major technological inventions of the past several 
hundred years: Think the printing press, the steam 
engine, electricity, computing and the Internet, 
among others.
THE CRITICAL IMPACT OF ARTIFICIAL 
INTELLIGENCE 
Since the firm first started using AI over a decade 
ago, and its first mention in my 2017 letter to 
shareholders, we have grown our AI organization 
materially. It now includes more than 2,000 AI/
machine learning (ML) experts and data scientists. 
We continue to attract some of the best and 
brightest in this space and have an exceptional 
firmwide AI/ML and Research department with 
deep expertise.
We have been actively using predictive AI and ML 
for years — and now have over 400 use cases in 
production in areas such as marketing, fraud and 
risk — and they are increasingly driving real business value across our businesses and functions. 
We’re also exploring the potential that generative 
AI (GenAI) can unlock across a range of domains, 
most notably in software engineering, customer 
service and operations, as well as in general 
employee productivity. In the future, we envision 
GenAI helping us reimagine entire business workflows. We will continue to experiment with these 
AI and ML capabilities and implement solutions in 
a safe, responsible way.
While we are investing more money in our AI capabilities, many of these projects pay for themselves. 
Over time, we anticipate that our use of AI has the 
potential to augment virtually every job, as well as 
impact our workforce composition. It may reduce 
certain job categories or roles, but it may create 
others as well. As we have in the past, we will 
aggressively retrain and redeploy our talent to 
make sure we are taking care of our employees 
if they are affected by this trend. 
Finally, as a global leader across businesses and 
regions, we have large amounts of extraordinarily 
rich data that, together with AI, can fuel better 
insights and help us improve how we manage risk 
and serve our customers. In addition to making 
sure our data is high quality and easily accessible, 
we need to complete the migration of our analytical data estate to the public cloud. These new data 
platforms offer high-performance compute power, 
which will unlock our ability to use our data in 
ways that are hard to contemplate today.
Recognizing the importance of AI to our 
business, we created a new position called 
Chief Data & Analytics Officer that sits on our 
Operating Committee. 
Elevating this new role to the Operating Committee 
level — reporting directly to Daniel Pinto and me — 
reflects how critical this function will be going forward and how seriously we expect AI to influence 
our business. This will embed data and analytics 
into our decision making at every level of the company. The primary focus is not just on the technical 
aspects of AI but also on how all management can 
— and should — use it. Each of our lines of business 
has corresponding data and analytics roles so we 
can share best practices, develop reusable solutions 
that solve multiple business problems, and continuously learn and improve as the future of AI unfolds. 
UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY

Clearly, AI comes with many risks, which need 
to be rigorously managed.
We have a robust, well-established risk and control 
framework that helps us proactively stay in front 
of AI-related risks, particularly as the regulatory 
landscape evolves. And we will, of course, continue 
to work hard with our regulators, clients and subject matter experts to make sure we maintain the 
highest ethical standards and are transparent in 
how AI helps us make decisions; e.g., to counter 
bias among other things. 
You may already be aware that there are bad 
actors using AI to try to infiltrate companies’ systems to steal money and intellectual property or 
simply to cause disruption and damage. For our 
part, we incorporate AI into our toolset to counter 
these threats and proactively detect and mitigate 
their efforts. 
OUR JOURNEY TO THE CLOUD
Getting our technology to the cloud — whether the 
public cloud or the private cloud — is essential to 
fully maximize all of our capabilities, including the 
power of our data. The cloud offers many benefits: 
1) it accelerates the speed of delivery of new services; 2) it simultaneously reduces the cost of compute power and enables, when needed, an extraordinary amount of compute capability — called 
burst computing; 3) it provides that compute capability across all of our data; and 4) it allows us to 
be able to constantly and quickly adopt new technologies because updated cloud services are continually being added — more so in the public cloud, 
where we benefit from the innovation that all 
cloud providers create, than in the private cloud, 
where innovation is only our own. 
Of course, we are learning a lot along the way. 
For example, we know we should carefully pick 
which applications and which data go to the public 
cloud versus the private cloud because of the 
expense, security and capabilities required. In 
addition, it is critical that we eventually use multiple clouds to avoid lock-in. And we intend to maintain our own expertise so that we’re never reliant 
on the expertise of others even if that requires 
additional money.
We invested approximately $2 billion to build four 
new, modern, private cloud-based, highly reliable 
and efficient data centers in the United States (we 
have 32 data centers globally). To date, about 50% 
of our applications run a large part of their processing in the public or private cloud. Approximately 70% of our data is now running in the public or private cloud. By the end of 2024, we aim to 
have 70% of applications and 75% of data moved 
to the public or private cloud. The new data centers are around 30% more efficient than our existing legacy data centers. Going to the public cloud 
can provide 30% additional efficiency if done correctly (efficiency improves when your data and 
applications have been modified, or “refactored,” 
to enable new cloud services). We have been constantly updating most of our global data centers, 
and by the end of this year, we can start closing 
some that are larger, older and less efficient. 
ACQUIRING FIRST REPUBLIC BANK AND 
ITS CUSTOMERS
The purchase of First Republic Bank was not something that we would have done just for ourselves. 
But the regulators relied on us to step forward (we 
worked hand in hand with the Federal Reserve, the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and 
the U.S. Treasury), and the purchase of First 
Republic helped stabilize and strengthen the U.S. 
financial system in a time of crisis.
The acquisition of a major company entails a lot of 
complexity. People tend to focus on the financial 
and economic outcomes, which is a reasonable 
thing to do. And in the case of First Republic, 
the numbers look rather good. We recorded an 
accounting gain of $3 billion on the purchase, and 
we told the world we expected to add more than 
$500 million to earnings annually, which we now 
believe will be closer to $2 billion. However, these 
results mask some of the true costs. First, approximately one-third of the incremental earning was 
simply deploying excess capital and liquidity, which 
doesn’t require purchasing a $300 billion bank — 
we simply could have bought $300 billion of 
assets. Second, as soon as the deal was 
announced, approximately 7,600 of our employees 
went from working on tasks that would benefit the 
future of JPMorgan Chase to working on the

merger integration. Overall, the integration 
involves effectively combining more than 165 
systems (e.g., statement, deposit, accounting and 
human resources) and consolidating policies, risk 
reporting, and other various rules and procedures. 
We hope to have most of the integration done by 
the middle of 2024.
Fortunately, we were very familiar and comfortable with all of the assets we were acquiring from 
First Republic. What we didn’t take on was First 
Republic’s excessive interest rate exposure — one 
of the reasons it failed — which we effectively 
hedged within days of the acquisition. 
Our people did a great job of respectfully managing this transition, knowing that circumstances 
were particularly tough for our new colleagues, 
whom we tried to welcome with open arms. We did 
everything we could to redeploy individuals whose 
jobs were lost because of the merger (we directly 
hired over 5,000 people). Our approach has always 
been to go into an acquisition knowing we can 
learn things from other teams, and in this case, 
we did: First Republic had done an outstanding job 
serving high-net-worth clients and venture capitalists, and we are developing what is effectively a 
new business for us following First Republic’s servicing model. We will serve these high-net-worth 
clients through a single point of contact, supported 
by a concierge service model, across our distribution channels — including more than 20 new 
J.P. Morgan branded branches. 
NAVIGATING IN A COMPLEX AND 
POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS WORLD
In the policy section, we talk about how we may be 
entering one of the most treacherous geopolitical 
eras since World War II. And I have written in the 
past about high levels of debt, fiscal stimulus, 
ongoing deficit spending and the unknown effects 
of quantitative tightening (which I am more worried about than most) so I won’t repeat those 
views here. However, the impacts of these geopolitical and economic forces are large and somewhat unprecedented; they may not be fully understood until they have completely played out over 
multiple years. In any case, JPMorgan Chase must 
be prepared for the various potential impacts and 
outcomes on our company and our people.
We remain wary of economic prognosticating. 
While all companies essentially budget on a base 
case forecast, we are very careful not to run our 
business that way. Instead, we look at a range of 
potential outcomes for which we need to be prepared. Geopolitical and economic forces have an 
unpredictable timetable — they may unfold over 
months, or years, and are nearly impossible to put 
into a one-year forecast. They also have an unpredictable interplay: For example, the geopolitical 
situation may end up having virtually no effect on 
the world’s economy or it could potentially be its 
determinative factor. 
We have ongoing concerns about persistent 
inflationary pressures and consider a wide 
range of outcomes to manage interest rate 
exposure and other business risks. 
Many key economic indicators today continue 
to be good and possibly improving, including 
inflation. But when looking ahead to tomorrow, 
conditions that will affect the future should be 
considered. For example, there seems to be a large 
number of persistent inflationary pressures, which 
may likely continue. All of the following factors 
appear to be inflationary: ongoing fiscal spending, 
remilitarization of the world, restructuring of 
global trade, capital needs of the new green economy, and possibly higher energy costs in the future 
(even though there currently is an oversupply of 
gas and plentiful spare capacity in oil) due to a lack 
of needed investment in the energy infrastructure. 
In the past, fiscal deficits did not seem to be 
closely related to inflation. In the 1970s and early 
1980s, there was a general understanding that 
inflation was driven by “guns and butter”; i.e., 
fiscal deficits and the increase to the money 
supply, both partially driven by the Vietnam War, 
led to increased inflation, which went over 10%. 
The deficits today are even larger and occurring in 
boom times — not as the result of a recession — 
and they have been supported by quantitative 
easing, which was never done before the great 
financial crisis. Quantitative easing is a form of 
increasing the money supply (though it has many 
offsets). I remain more concerned about quantitative easing than most, and its reversal, which has 
never been done before at this scale. 
UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY

Equity values, by most measures, are at the high 
end of the valuation range, and credit spreads are 
extremely tight. These markets seem to be pricing 
in at a 70% to 80% chance of a soft landing — 
modest growth along with declining inflation and 
interest rates. I believe the odds are a lot lower 
than that. In the meantime, there seems to be an 
enormous focus, too much so, on monthly inflation 
data and modest changes to interest rates. But the 
die may be cast — interest rates looking out a year 
or two may be predetermined by all of the factors 
I mentioned above. Small changes in interest rates 
today may have less impact on inflation in the 
future than many people believe.
Therefore, we are prepared for a very broad range 
of interest rates, from 2% to 8% or even more, 
with equally wide-ranging economic outcomes — 
from strong economic growth with moderate inflation (in this case, higher interest rates would result 
from higher demand for capital) to a recession 
with inflation; i.e., stagflation. Economically, the 
worst-case scenario would be stagflation, which 
would not only come with higher interest rates but 
also with higher credit losses, lower business 
volumes and more difficult markets. Under these 
many different scenarios, our company would 
continue to perform at least okay. Importantly, 
being prepared means we can continue to help our 
clients no matter what the future portends. 
The mini banking crisis of 2023 is over, but 
beware of higher rates and recession — not 
just for banks but for the whole economy.
When we purchased First Republic in May 2023 
following the failure of two other regional banks, 
Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank, we 
thought that the current banking crisis was over. 
Only these three banks were offsides in having 
the toxic combination of extreme interest rate 
exposure, large unrealized losses in the 
held-to-maturity (HTM) portfolio and highly 
concentrated deposits. Most of the other regional 
banks did not have these problems. However, we 
stipulated that the crisis was over provided that 
interest rates didn’t go up dramatically and we 
didn’t experience a serious recession. If long-end 
rates go up over 6% and this increase is accompanied by a recession, there will be plenty of stress — 
not just in the banking system but with leveraged 
companies and others. Remember, a simple 2 
percentage point increase in rates essentially 
reduced the value of most financial assets by 20%, 
and certain real estate assets, specifically office 
real estate, may be worth even less due to the 
effects of recession and higher vacancies. Also 
remember that credit spreads tend to widen, 
sometimes dramatically, in a recession. 
Finally, we should also consider that rates have 
been extremely low for a long time — it’s hard to 
know how many investors and companies are truly 
prepared for a higher rate environment. 
We seek to be engaged globally and carefully 
manage complex countries and geopolitical 
issues.
JPMorgan Chase does business in more than 100 
countries, and we have people on the ground in 
over 60 countries. In almost all those locations, we 
do research on their economy, their markets and 
their companies; we bank their government institutions and their companies; and we bank multinational corporations, including the U.S. multinational corporations within their borders. This is a 
critical role — not only in helping those countries 
grow and improve but also in expanding the global 
economy. 
Many of these countries are quite complex with different laws, customs and regulations. We are occasionally asked why we bank certain companies and 
even certain countries, particularly when countries 
have some laws and customs that are counter to 
many of the values held in the United States. 
Here’s why:
• The U.S. government sets foreign policy. And 
when it does, we salute. Wherever we do business, we follow the law of the United States, as it 
applies in that country (in addition to the laws of 
the country itself), in all respects. Think of trade 
rules, sanctions, anti-money laundering and the 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, among others. By 
and large, these things help improve those countries. In most cases, the U.S. government does 
not want us to leave because it agrees, generally, that the engagement of American business 
enhances our relationships with other countries 
and helps those countries themselves. 
UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY

 • Engagement makes the world a better place. 
We all should want the world to continue to 
improve. Isolation and lack of engagement do 
not accomplish that goal. While we believe that 
it makes sense for the United States to push for 
constant improvement around the world — from 
advocating for human rights to fighting corruption — this is rarely accomplished through coercion, and, in fact, is enhanced by engagement. 
 • We need to be prepared for emerging 
challenges and position ourselves to understand them. We created a new role — Head of 
Asia Pacific Policy and Strategic Competitiveness 
— to focus specifically on key policy issues 
critical to the firm’s (and, in fact, the country’s) 
competitiveness, such as trade restrictions, 
supply chains and infrastructure. We also created a new strategic security forum to focus on 
emerging and evolving risks, including trade 
wars, pandemics, cybersecurity and actual 
wars, to name just a few. 
OUR EXTENSIVE COMMUNITY 
OUTREACH EFFORTS, INCLUDING 
DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION 
JPMorgan Chase makes an extraordinary effort as 
part of our “normal” day-to-day outreach to 
engage with individual clients, small and midsized 
businesses, large and multinational firms, government officials, regulators and the press in cities all 
around the world. This dialogue is part of the normal course of business but it is also part of building trust and putting down roots in a community. 
We believe that companies, and banks in particular, must earn the trust of the communities and 
countries in which they operate. We believe — and 
we are unashamed about this — that it is our obligation to help lift up the communities and countries in 
which we do business. We believe that doing so 
enhances business and the general economic 
well-being of those communities and countries and 
also enhances long-term shareholder value. JPMorgan Chase thrives when communities thrive. 
This approach is integral to what we do, in great 
scale, around the world — and it works. We are 
quite clear that whether our efforts are inspired by 
the goodness of our hearts (as philanthropy or 
venture-type investing) or good business, we try 
to measure the actual outcomes. 
It’s also interesting to point out that many of our 
efforts were spawned from our work around 
Advancing Black Pathways, Military and Veterans 
Affairs, and our work in Detroit. While we’ve 
banked Detroit for more than 90 years, our $200 
million investment in its economic recovery over 
the last decade demonstrated that investing in 
communities is a smart business strategy. We are 
one of the largest banks in Detroit, from consumer 
banking to investment banking, and it’s quite clear 
that not only did our efforts help Detroit, but they 
also helped us gain market share. The extent of 
Detroit’s remarkable recovery was recently highlighted when Moody’s upgraded the city’s credit 
rating to investment grade — an extraordinary 
achievement just over 10 years after the city filed 
the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.
For JPMorgan Chase, Detroit was an incubator for 
developing models that help us hone how we 
deploy our business resources, philanthropic capital, skilled volunteerism, and low-cost loans and 
equity investments, as well as how we identify top 
talent to drive successful business and societal 
improvements. I hope that, as shareholders, you 
are proud of our focus on promoting opportunity 
for all, both within and outside our organization, 
which includes economic opportunity. Some of our 
initiatives are listed below. 
• Business Resource Groups. To deepen our culture of inclusion in the workplace, we have 10 
Business Resource Groups (BRG) across the company to connect more than 160,000 participating employees around common interests, as well 
as to foster networking and camaraderie. 
Groups welcome anyone — allies and those with 
shared affinities alike. For example, some of our 
largest BRGs are Access Ability (employees with 
disabilities and caregivers), Adelante (Hispanic 
and Latino employees), BOLD (Black employees), 
NextGen (early career professionals), PRIDE 
(LGBTQ+ employees) and Women on the Move. 
UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY

• Women on the Move. At JPMorgan Chase, they 
sure are! Women represent 28% of our firm’s 
senior leadership globally. In fact, our major 
lines of business — CCB, AWM and CIB, which 
would be among Fortune 1000 companies on 
their own — are all run by women (one with a 
co-head who is male). More than 10 years ago, a 
handful of senior women at the company, on 
their own, started this global, firmwide, internally focused organization called Women on the 
Move. It was so successful that we expanded the 
initiative beyond the company; it now empowers 
clients and consumers, as well as women 
employees and their allies, to build their 
careers, grow their businesses and improve 
their financial health. The Women on the Move 
BRG has more than 70,000 employees globally. 
• Advancing Black Pathways. This comprehensive 
program, which just reached the five-year mark, 
focuses on strengthening the economic foundation of Black communities because we know that 
opportunity is not always created equally. The 
program does so by, among other accomplishments, helping to diversify our talent pipeline, 
providing opportunities for Black individuals to 
enter the workforce and gain valuable experience, and investing in the financial success of 
Black Americans through a focus on financial 
health, homeownership and entrepreneurship. 
An important part of the program’s work is 
achieved through our investment in Historically 
Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU). We now 
partner with 18 schools across the United States 
to boost recruitment connections, expand 
career pathways for Black students and other 
students, and support their long-term development and financial health. As a measure of the 
program’s success, in four years we have made 
nearly 400 hires into summer and full-time 
analyst and associate roles at the firm.
• Military and Veterans Affairs. This firmwide 
effort sponsors recruitment, mentorship and 
development programs to support the military 
members and veterans working at JPMorgan 
Chase. Back in 2011, we joined with 10 other companies to launch the Veteran Jobs Mission (VJM), 
whose membership has since grown to more than 
300 companies representing various industries 
across the United States and has hired over 
900,000 veterans and military spouses. In 2023, 
VJM announced the creation of its Advisory 
Board, which is composed of 14 corporate leaders, to provide strategic direction and oversight 
of VJM as it continues to expand its commitment 
to support economic opportunities for veterans 
and military spouses, including its goal to hire 2 
million veterans and 200,000 military spouses by 
2030. JPMorgan Chase alone has hired in excess 
of 18,000 veterans since 2011 and currently 
employs more than 3,100 military spouses.
• Creating opportunity for people with disabilities. The firm’s Office of Disability Inclusion 
continues to lead strategy and initiatives aimed 
at advancing economic opportunity for people 
with disabilities. In 2023, we joined lawmakers 
and business leaders in Washington, D.C., to 
show support for passage of the Supplemental 
Security Income (SSI) Savings Penalty 
Elimination Act. Modernizing the SSI program, 
by updating asset limits for the first time in 
nearly 40 years, would allow millions of people 
with disabilities who receive SSI benefits the 
opportunity to build their savings without putting their essential benefits at risk. We also 
provided business coaching to more than 370 
entrepreneurs with disabilities. 
• Virtual call centers. When we sought to expand 
our customer service specialists program across 
the United States, we turned to Detroit, launching our first virtual call center in 2022. Investments in Detroit’s workforce development 
infrastructure helped us hire 90 virtual customer service specialists for a program that 
has outperformed many of our traditional call 
centers around the world. Following this success, we expanded our hiring efforts and this 
virtual program to Baltimore to create new jobs 
that jump-start careers. And now we’re evaluating the possibility of expanding even further.

• Entrepreneurs of Color Fund. A critical challenge we have seen in so many communities is 
that traditional lending standards render too 
many entrepreneurs — particularly entrepreneurs of color and those serving these communities — ineligible for credit. In response, we 
helped launch the Entrepreneurs of Color Fund 
(EOCF) in Detroit, a lending program designed to 
help aspiring small business owners gain access 
to critical resources needed for growth that are 
often not equitably available — capital, technical 
assistance and mentorship, among others. 
These challenges aren’t unique to Detroit so we 
worked with community development financial 
institutions to replicate the EOCF program in 
10 markets across the United States in 2023, 
deploying more than 2,900 loans and $176 
million in capital to underserved entrepreneurs 
across the country. 
• Senior business consultants. To help entrepreneurs and small businesses make the transition 
from community lending to accessing capital 
from traditional financial institutions, we created 
a new job — senior business consultant — to 
provide support. Senior business consultants in 
branches that focus on underserved communities offer coaching and help business owners 
with everything from navigating access to credit 
to managing cash flow to generating effective 
marketing. Since 2020, these consultants have 
mentored more than 5,500 business owners, 
helping them improve their operations, grow 
revenue and network with others in the local 
business community. 
• AdvancingCities. The organizing principles that 
define the business and community investments 
we make and how we best achieve an overall 
impact in local economies were heavily influenced by our experience in Detroit. Seeing 
Detroit’s comeback begin to take shape several 
years ago, we created AdvancingCities to replicate this model for large-scale investments to 
other cities around the world. From San Francisco to Paris to Greater Washington, D.C., we’ve 
applied what we learned in Detroit to communities where conditions are opportune for success 
and require deeper investments — where community, civic and business leaders have come 
together to solve problems and get results. 
• JPMorgan Chase Service Corps. Ten years ago, 
we launched the JPMorgan Chase Service Corps 
to strengthen the capacity-building of nonprofit 
partners. We brought employees from around 
the world to Detroit to assist with its recovery — 
from creating a scoring model for a nonprofit to 
helping prioritize neighborhoods for development funding to devising an implementation 
plan for an integrated talent management 
system. Since that time, the Service Corps has 
expanded, with more than 1,500 JPMorgan 
Chase employees contributing 100,000 hours 
to support over 300 nonprofits globally. 
• Community Centers/Branches and Community 
Managers. A local bank branch, especially in a 
low-income neighborhood, can be successful 
only when it fits the community’s needs. That is 
why over the last several years we have shifted 
our approach to how we offer access to financial 
health education, as well as low-cost products 
and services to help build wealth. Since 2019, 
we have opened 16 Community Center branches, 
often in areas with larger Black, Hispanic or 
Latino populations, and have plans to open 
three more by the end of 2024. These branches 
have more space to host grassroots community 
events, small business mentoring sessions and 
financial health seminars, which have been 
well-attended — to date, over 400,000 people 
have taken advantage of the financial education 
seminars. In each of these Community Center 
branches, we hired a Community Manager (who 
acts as a local ambassador) to build relationships with community leaders, nonprofits and 
small businesses. The Community Manager 
concept and practice have become so successful 
that we have also placed these managers in 
many of our traditional branches in underserved 
communities. We now have 149 Community 
Managers throughout our branch network. 
• Work skills development. Detroit showed us 
how talent in communities is often overlooked. 
We saw this in the early days of our investment 
when we visited our partners at Focus: HOPE, a 
training program designed to help Detroiters 
develop skills for high-demand jobs. Quickly, it 
became clear that the training and education 
system in Detroit was disconnected from 
UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY

employers and their talent needs. By investing 
in programs like Focus: HOPE, we have been 
able to help bridge local skills gaps by training 
people for in-demand jobs in communities like 
Dallas, Miami and Washington, D.C. Between 
2019 and 2023, we supported more than 2 million people through our extensive learning and 
career programming around the world.
• Increasing our rural investment. We are proud 
to be the only bank with branches in all 48 contiguous states, which include many rural communities. Nearly 17 million consumers living in 
rural areas hold over $100 billion in deposits 
with us and $175 billion in loans. We are also a 
leading wholesale lender in these communities, 
helping to fuel local economies through relationships with local companies, governments, hospitals and universities. Since 2019, we have made 
material progress in extending our footprint to 
reach more rural Americans, including expanding our branch network into 13 new states with 
large rural populations. Now we are raising the 
bar. With our new strategy, we have a goal to 
have a branch available to serve 50% of a state’s 
population within an acceptable driving distance, including in heavily rural states such as 
Alabama and Iowa. This focus is part of our 
recently announced plan to build an additional 
500 branches and hire 3,500 employees over 
the next three years. Through this expansion, 
we will partner across lines of business and our 
Corporate Responsibility organization to help 
advance inclusive economic growth and bring 
the full force of the firm to America’s heartland. 
We’ve nearly completed our five-year, $30 
billion Racial Equity Commitment — it will now 
become a permanent part of our business. 
What began in 2020 as a five-year, $30 billion 
commitment is now transforming into a consistent 
business practice for our lines of business in 
support of Black, Hispanic, Latino and other 
underserved communities. By the end of 2023, 
we reported over $30 billion in progress toward 
our original goal. However, our focus is not on 
how much money is deployed — but on long-term 
impact and outcomes. And going forward, these 
programs will be embedded in our businessas-usual operating system. 
• Affordable rental housing. Through our 
Affordable Housing Preservation program, we 
approved program funding to date of approximately $21 billion in loans to incentivize the 
preservation of over 190,000 affordable housing 
rental units across the United States. Additionally, we financed approximately $5 billion for the 
construction and rehabilitation of affordable 
rental housing. 
• Homeownership. In 2023, we expanded our 
$5,000 Chase Homebuyer Grant program to 
include over 15,000 majority Black, Hispanic and 
Latino communities — and in January 2024, we 
increased our grant amount to $7,500 in select 
markets. Since our grant program began in 
2021, we have provided about 8,600 grants 
totaling $43 million. We also have provided 
home purchase and refinance loans in 2023 
worth over $4.6 billion for more than 14,000 
Black, Hispanic and Latino households across 
the economic spectrum.
• Small business. The Business Card Special 
Purpose Credit Program, launched in January 
2023, has provided over 10,900 cards, totaling 
over $43 million in available credit lines to 
underserved entrepreneurs and communities 
across the United States.
UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY

• Supplier diversity. In 2023, our firm spent 
approximately $2.3 billion directly with diverse 
suppliers — an increase of 10% over 2022. As a 
part of our racial equity commitment, over $450 
million was spent in 2023 with more than 190 
Black-, Hispanic- and Latino-owned businesses. 
• Minority depository institutions and community development financial institutions. To 
date, we have invested more than $110 million in 
equity in diverse financial institutions and provided over $260 million in incremental financing 
to community development financial institutions 
to support communities that lack access to traditional financing. JPMorgan Chase also helped 
these institutions build their capacity so they 
can provide a greater number of critical services 
like mortgages and small business loans.
We’re thoughtfully continuing our diversity, 
equity and inclusion efforts. 
Of course, JPMorgan Chase will conform as the 
laws evolve. We will scour our programs, our words 
and our actions to make sure they comply. 
That said, we think all the efforts mentioned 
above will remain largely unchanged. And, in fact, 
around the world, cities and communities where 
we do business applaud these efforts. We also 
believe our initiatives make us a more inclusive 
company and lead to more innovation, smarter 
decisions and better financial results for us and 
for the economy overall. 
We are often asked in particular about “equity” 
and what that word means. To us, it means equal 
treatment, equal opportunity and equal access … 
not equal outcomes. There is nothing wrong with 
acknowledging and trying to bridge social and economic gaps, whether they be around wealth or 
health. We would like to provide a fair chance for 
everyone to succeed — regardless of their background. And we want to make sure everyone who 
works at our company feels welcome. 
We want to articulate how we weigh in on 
social issues and what it means for our 
customers.
Before I comment about culture issues, I have a 
confession to make: I am a full-throated, redblooded, patriotic, free-enterprise (properly regulated, of course) and free-market capitalist. Our 
company is frequently asked to take a position on 
an issue, rule or legislation that might be considered “cultural.” When that happens, we take a 
deep breath and study the matter. Many of the 
laws in question have many specific requirements, 
some of which you would agree with but not others. But we are being asked to support the entire 
law. In cases like these, we simply make our own 
statement that reflects our educated view and values; however, we do not give our voice to others. 
We believe in the values of democracy, including 
freedom of speech and expression, and are 
staunchly against discrimination and hate. We 
have not turned away — and will not turn away — 
customers because of their political or religious 
affiliations nor would we tell customers how they 
should spend their money. 
Our commitment to these ideals is also reflected in 
our employees. The talent at our firm is a vibrant 
mix of cultures, beliefs and backgrounds. We are, 
of course, fully committed to freedom of speech. 
There are things that you can say that would be 
permitted under freedom of speech but would not 
be allowed under our Code of Conduct. For example, we do not allow intimidation, threats or highly 
prejudicial behavior or speech. Our Code of Conduct clearly stipulates that certain statements and 
behavior, while allowed under freedom of speech, 
can lead to disciplinary action at our company — 
from being reprimanded to being fired.

WHAT WE LEARNED: A FIVE-POINT ACTION PLAN TO MOVE FORWARD 
ON THE CLIMATE CHALLENGE 
In May 2023, we gathered with knowledgeable and influential 
people from the energy industry writ large to the government 
and financial services arena in Scottsdale, Arizona, for an 
action forum. The goal was to explore various aspects of the 
climate challenge and try to devise effective solutions that 
could help lead to meaningful progress. The climate challenge 
is immense and complex. Addressing it requires more than 
making simplistic statements and rules; rather, energy 
systems and global supply chains need to be transformed 
across virtually all industries. And there is also a deep need 
for new research and development. Energy systems and 
supply chains provide the foundation of the global economy 
and must be treated with care.
At the same time, the opportunity here is immense. The 
investment required to meet climate goals — estimated at over 
$5 trillion annually — could generate economywide growth and 
opportunity at a scale the world has not seen since the 
Industrial Revolution.
The task for industry, policymakers and finance is to help 
formulate solutions that support the transition to a low-carbon 
economy, balancing affordable, reliable access to energy with 
generating economic growth.
To find a way forward, we sought input from diverse 
stakeholders in pursuit of a North Star. In Scottsdale and in 
discussions with clients across industries about what’s needed 
to achieve a low-carbon economy, these five action steps and 
reforms were top of mind:
 • Supportive government policy and leadership to advance 
the transition. Policy that promotes favorable economic 
conditions to make the transition viable is a critical first step 
for clients. This includes government leadership via 
mandates, incentives or subsidies to support jobs and 
investment in the transition; actions on permitting and 
interconnection reform; and regulatory clarity and 
certainty, especially around long-term investments. As one 
vital example, current grid infrastructure is insufficient to 
accommodate the growth in renewables. 
 • Public/private partnerships in scaling bankable projects. 
Scaling investments needs to happen both for commercially 
proven technologies (e.g., wind and solar) and for emerging 
technologies (e.g., green hydrogen, sustainable aviation fuel 
and carbon capture). Developing “bankable” clean energy 
projects will require the application of smart financial tools, 
as well as further policy support. It will take public/private 
partnerships and innovation to create catalytic forms of 
capital that can step into these gaps, absorb first-mover 
risks and provide the necessary funding.?The cost of capital 
is too high for some companies — and public funds ought 
to be deployed in a smart way that effectively attracts 
private capital. 
 • Public education and engagement. Without question, clients 
told us that public commitment to and investment in energyrelated infrastructure is one of the most important parts of 
combating the climate crisis and running their businesses. 
Supporting the buildout of energy-related infrastructure with 
speed and scale is critical. Public acceptance of building and 
advancing the infrastructure needed to meet climate goals is 
at the heart of progress. While the energy transition is poised 
to deliver benefits to communities across the world, securing 
acceptance and support to build clean energy infrastructure 
at scale is challenging. Access to job-creating renewable 
energy projects can help rural communities thrive by 
advancing local economies. Ensuring public support and 
social license to operate requires better engagement 
strategies, including widespread stakeholder education about 
the benefits of these technologies for local communities. 
 • Communication about concrete successes. Across 
industries, market participants need to do a better job of 
celebrating and championing concrete successes and 
tangible milestones. This includes highlighting success 
stories around emerging technologies and the complex 
nature of the carbon transition. Stakeholders also should 
better convey the benefits of clean energy — across all 
technologies — to help combat misinformation and foster a 
more informed dialogue.

 • Work skills training. Businesses depend on healthy, thriving 
communities so the carbon transition needs to work for 
everyone. This includes helping to ensure that workers are 
trained in the skills for the future, such as through improved 
engineering schools and job training programs. Work across 
the entire supply chain is essential to moving at pace. As one 
example, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates we will 
need more than 70,000 additional electricians per year 
through 2031; it is currently unclear how the market will 
meet that demand. If the deployment of heat pumps and 
electric vehicle chargers accelerates, demand for electricians 
will be even higher. A concerted focus to train electricians 
can help the United States meet some of its climate goals 
while providing well-paying jobs that do not require a fouryear college degree. Also, broadly speaking, businesses are 
in a better position to make investments with confidence 
when labor requirements across the value chain — from 
design and manufacturing to installation — are satisfied.
We recently reconsidered certain memberships.
JPMorgan Chase recently exited Climate Action 100+ and the 
Equator Principles. “Why?” we are asked. While we don’t 
necessarily disagree with some of the principles many 
organizations have, we make our own business decisions. We 
think we have some of the best-in-class environmental, social 
and risk standards because we have invested in our own 
in-house experts and matured our own risk management 
processes over the years. As a result, we are going to go our 
own way and make our own independent decisions, gathering 
the best learnings of experts in the field, and, of course, we 
will follow all legal requirements.
We are engaged but recognize our role: three more 
important points.
First, everyone should understand that conquering the climate 
problem needs proper government action, particularly around 
taxes, permitting, grids, infrastructure building and proper 
coordination of policies — we are not there yet. Second, there is 
no known technology that can fill the gap between our 
“aspirations” and the current trajectory of the world. We hope 
and believe that this will be found (for example, through carbon 
capture, improved batteries, hydrogen or other measures). This 
new technology will also require proper government research 
and development funding, as the effort cannot be accomplished 
by private enterprise alone. And third, we are going to use the 
word “commitment” much more reservedly in the future, 
clearly differentiating between aspirations we are actively 
striving toward and binding commitments.
For JPMorgan Chase to play the right role in tackling the 
climate challenge, we have organized a special group around 
the green economy and related infrastructure investment. 
This group will coordinate and inform our work across all 
established industry groups (from auto to real estate, energy, 
agriculture and others) and includes hundreds of employees 
devoted to these efforts.

GIVING THE BANK REGULATORY AND 
SUPERVISORY PROCESS A SERIOUS 
REVIEW
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) was finished 14 years 
ago, and we believe it accomplished a lot of good 
things. But it’s been quite a while since then, and 
we’re still debating some very basic issues. It’s 
time to take a serious, hard, honest look at what 
has been done and what can be improved. 
It’s good to remember that the United States has 
the best financial system in the world, with diversified, deep and experienced institutions, from 
banks, pension plans, hedge funds and private 
equity to individual investors. It has healthy public 
and private markets, transparency, rule of law and 
deep research. The best banking system in the 
world is a critical part of this, and, integrated with 
the overall financial system, is foundational to the 
proper allocation of capital, innovation and the 
fueling of America’s growth engine. 
This is not about JPMorgan Chase — we believe we 
can manage through whatever is thrown our way. 
This is about the impact on all parts of the system 
— from smaller banks to larger regional banks that 
may not have the resources to handle all of these 
regulatory requirements. It’s also about the effect 
on the financial markets and the economy from the 
rapidly growing shadow banking system, as well as 
the ultimate impact on the customers, clients and 
communities we serve. This is about what’s right 
for the system. 
The banking and financial system is 
innovative, dynamic and constantly changing.
The banking system is not static: There are startup 
banks, mergers, successful upstarts and fintech 
banks, and even Apple, which effectively acts as a 
bank — it holds money, moves money, lends money 
and so on. Nonbanks are competing with traditional banks, and, in general, this dynamism and 
churn are good for innovation and invention — with 
success and failure simply part of the robust process. Innovation runs across payments systems, 
budgeting, digital access, product extensions, risk 
and fraud prevention, and other services. Different 
institutions play different roles, and, importantly, 
small banks and big banks serve completely different strategic functions. Large banks bank multinational corporations around the world, make 
healthy markets, and wield technology and a product set that are the best in the world. A small bank 
simply cannot bank these same multinational governments and safely move the amount of money 
and securities that large banks do. Regional and 
community banks have exceptional local knowledge and presence and are critical in serving 
thousands of towns and certain geographies. 
It is also important to recognize that the banking 
system as we know it is shrinking relative to private markets and fintech, which are growing and 
becoming increasingly competitive. And remember 
that many of these new players do not have the 
same transparency or need to abide by the extensive rules and regulations as traditional banks, 
even if they offer similar products — this often 
gives them significant advantage. 
To deal with this fluid environment, banks of all 
sizes develop their own strategies, whether to 
specialize, expand geographically or embark on 
mergers and acquisitions. There are certain banking 
services where economies of scale are a competitive 
advantage, but not all banks need to become bigger 
to gain this benefit (there are many highly successful banks that are smaller). What is clear is that 
banks should be allowed to pursue their individual 
strategies, including mergers and acquisitions, as 
they see fit. Overall, this process should be allowed 
to happen — it’s part of the natural and healthy 
course of capitalism — and it can be done without 
harming the American taxpayer or economy. 
While we all want a strong banking and financial 
system, we should step back and assess how all the 
regulatory steps we have taken measure up against 
the goals we all share. Since Dodd-Frank was signed 
into law in 2010, thousands of rules and reporting 
requirements written by 10+ different regulatory 
bodies in the United States alone have been added. 
And it would probably be an understatement to say 
that some are duplicative, inconsistent, procyclical, 
contradictory, extremely costly, and unnecessarily 
painful for both banks and regulators. Many of the 
rules have unintended consequences that are not 
desirable and have negative impacts, such as 
increasing the cost of credit for consumers (hurting 
lower-income Americans the most). 
UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY

The whole process, including the Basel III 
endgame, could be much more productive, 
streamlined, economical, efficient and safe.
Both regulators and banks should want the same 
thing — a healthy banking system, serving its clients and striving for continuous improvement. 
We all should also want the enormous benefits that 
would come from good collaboration between regulators and bank management teams and boards. 
Over time, these relationships have deteriorated, 
and, again, are increasingly less constructive. 
There is little real collaboration between practitioners — the banks — and regulators, who generally have not been practitioners in business. While 
we acknowledge the dedication of regulators who 
work with banks on a daily basis, management 
teams across the industry are putting in 
a disproportionate amount of time addressing 
requests for extra details, documentation and 
processes that extend far beyond the actual rules 
— and distract both regulators and management 
from more critical work. We should be more 
focused on the truly important risks for the safety 
of the system. And unfortunately, without collaboration and sufficient analysis, it is hard to be confident that regulation will accomplish desired outcomes without undesirable consequences. Instead 
of constantly improving the system, we may be 
making it worse. A few additional points:
• The Basel III endgame disadvantages 
American banks. The Basel III endgame has 
been 10 years in the making, and it still has not 
been completed. In my view, many of the rules 
are flawed and poorly calibrated. If the Basel III 
endgame were implemented in its current form, 
it would hamper American banks: As proposed, 
it would increase our firm’s required capital by 
25%, making our requirement 30% higher than 
it would be under the equivalent European 
Union proposal. That means for every loan and 
asset financed in the United States by a major 
American bank, that bank would have to hold 
30% more capital than any international competitor. The proposed regulations would also 
damage market making (see the following section). There are many other flaws but suffice it to 
say that much of the work being done today to 
analyze the effects should have been done 
before the proposed rulemaking. 
One of the single most important lessons from 
the great financial crisis is that there is 
enormous value to having a bank that is 
well-managed and has diverse revenue sources. 
Yet regulation since then both punishes 
consolidation and diversification — and punishes 
performance — through many features of the 
GSIB surcharge. 
• Built over many years, the framework is now 
full of duplication. The following is only a partial list: American gold-plating and conceptual 
inconsistencies among Comprehensive Capital 
Analysis and Review (CCAR), recovery and resolution plans, liquidity requirements, global systemically important bank (GSIB) requirements, 
and safety and soundness principles. The many 
overlapping rules contribute to the bureaucracy 
that generates an extraordinary amount of 
make-work (an 80,000-page CCAR and shockingly another, coincidentally, 80,000-page 
recovery and resolution plan).
• The new rules do virtually nothing to fix what 
caused the failure of SVB and First Republic. 
For example, they don’t improve certain liquidity 
requirements, limit HTM accounting or reduce 
allowable interest rate exposure. 
• The current regulatory approach to liquidity 
might simply run counter to the stated intent. 
Regulations should recognize the value and 
importance of lending and borrowing against 
good collateral and using central bank 
resources, such as the discount window. 
Adhering to current liquidity requirements permanently ties up good liquidity in a way that 
makes the system more fragile and more risky. 
• It is not clear what the full intent of the Basel 
III endgame was — it will have unintended consequences. Without real analysis of expected 
outcomes, additional regulation will likely 
reduce the number of banks offering certain 
services and increase costs for all market participants and activity, including loans, market 
making and hedging (by farmers, airlines and 
countries, among others). And new rules might 
even increase consolidation as companies race 
to achieve economies of scale in certain products and services.

Unfortunately, some recent regulations are ending 
up in court. You can imagine that no one wants to 
sue their regulators. Banks would not sue if they did 
not think they were right — or if they thought they 
had any other recourse — which they effectively do 
not. This is definitely not what anyone should want. 
A more constructive relationship with regulators 
would reduce confusion and uncertainty and would 
lead to better outcomes for banks, their shareholders, and their clients, customers and communities. 
Collaboration between banks and regulators 
could improve the use of resources and create 
better outcomes. 
True collaboration could dramatically improve the 
banking system. For example:
• Redirect enormous resources from things that 
don’t matter to things that do. As mentioned, it 
takes 80,000 pages to describe a CCAR test and 
80,000 pages to detail recovery and resolution. 
The talent and resources at the banks and 
regulators could be better used elsewhere. 
Such overload is distracting and takes your eye 
off the ball on real, emerging risks, including 
China, trade, payment systems and cybersecurity, among others. 
• Reduce bureaucratic processes that provoke a 
tendency to herd mentality. For example, CCAR 
is just a point-in-time stress test, and it can lull 
you into a false sense of security — for reference, we do more than 100 stress tests each 
week. On interest rate exposure, focusing on 
the documentation of details may stop you from 
thinking about big interest rate exposure. 
Sometimes analyzing “what ifs” and fat tail risks 
is better than excessive and rigid models and 
documentations. 
• Examine risks outside the regulatory system 
that are rarely analyzed and largely unaddressed. These risks include data and privacy, 
as well as consumer banking and payment systems, which are growing fast in the unregulated 
market. In addition, there are potential risks 
from private credit markets (which I talk about 
later in the next section). 
• Let’s imagine what’s possible with real collaboration. Working together, we can improve how 
the FDIC manages failing institutions, how to limit 
contagion and restore confidence to depositors, 
how liquidity requirements can create more flexible funding for banks under stress, how the banking and Federal Reserve’s payment system can 
become more interoperable, how clearinghouse 
risk can be reduced, how stress tests can protect 
the system from a wider variety of outcomes, 
how costs and therefore consumer costs can be 
reduced (not increased), how anti-money laundering requirements can be simplified and 
improved at the same time, and how financial 
products can be brought to the unbanked. 
We can fix the housing and mortgage markets. 
For example, mortgage regulations around origination, servicing and securitization could be 
simplified, without increasing risk, in a way that 
would reduce the average mortgage by 70 or 80 
basis points. The Urban Institute estimates that 
a reduction like this would increase mortgage 
originations by 1 million per year and help 
lower-income households, in particular, buy 
their first home, thereby starting them on the 
best way to build household net worth. 
There are many more things that can be improved 
— and we really should start working on them.
We need a detailed review and probably a 
complete revamp.
I know this might be wishful thinking, but now 
would be a good time to step back and have a thorough and candid review of the thousands of new 
rules passed since Dodd-Frank. After this review, we 
should ask what is it that we really want: Do we 
want to try to eliminate the possibility of bank runs? 
Do we want to change and create liquidity rules that 
would essentially back most uninsured deposits? Do 
we want the mortgage business and leveraged lending business to be inside or outside the banking system? Do we want products that are inside and outside the banking system to be regulated the same 
way? Do we want to reasonably give smaller banks a 
leg up in purchasing a failing bank? And while DoddFrank did some good things, shouldn’t we take a 
look at the huge overlapping jurisdictions of various 
regulators? This overlap creates difficulties, not only 
for banks, but for the regulators, too. Any and all of 
this is achievable, and, I believe, could be accomplished with simpler rules and guidelines and without stifling our critical banking system.

PROTECTING THE ESSENTIAL ROLE OF 
MARKET MAKING (TRADING)
Before we discuss market making and financial 
markets, readers should understand that market 
making occurs in almost all businesses. There are 
healthy markets in farm animals, foreign products, commodities, energy, logistics, healthcare 
and so on. Healthy markets increase customer 
choice and reduce cost. They almost always 
involve holding inventory and taking some risk, 
which is simply a part of the process. America’s 
financial markets are the biggest in the world — 
U.S. public debt and equity markets total $137 
trillion, constituting the biggest “market” in the 
world, and are larger than America’s gross 
domestic product (GDP) of $27 trillion. 
Market participants are not “Wall Street.” They are 
large and small, mainly sophisticated, global investors (pension plans, mutual funds, governments 
and individuals) representing retirees, veterans, 
individuals, unions, federal workers and others. 
They all benefit from our efficient, low-cost and 
transparent markets. 
Some regulators seem to think that market making 
is a speculative, hedge fund-like activity — and this 
thinking is what might be leading them to constantly increase capital requirements. The proposed capital rules could fundamentally alter 
market-making activities that are critical to a 
 thriving economy, particularly in difficult markets 
when market making is even more important. 
The new rules would raise capital requirements 
by 50% for major banks — which could undermine 
market stability, make banking services costlier 
and less accessible, and push even more activity 
to a less regulated banking system.
Our financial system and markets are the best 
in the world and benefit ALL participants; 
exceptionally good market making in the 
secondary market makes our primary markets 
the best in the world. 
We should recognize that the United States has the 
biggest, deepest and most liquid capital markets in 
the world. For these markets to function, it is 
critical for transparency and liquidity to be in the 
secondary market. Market making provides this, 
promoting the flow of capital to real economy 
investments and supporting all sectors of the 
economy, including companies, state and local 
governments, universities, hospitals, pension plans 
and overall job creation. Without market making in 
the secondary market, it would be extremely difficult for companies to raise capital through the 
primary market — equity and debt offerings — 
which have totaled approximately $3.6 trillion on 
average over the past few years. The incredible 
strength of these markets enables companies of 
all sizes to grow and expand especially during times 
of volatility and stress. It also enables consumers to 
access cheaper credit and governments (local, state 
and federal) to reduce their borrowing costs. 
It takes enormous resources to properly 
support the Markets business. 
JPMorgan Chase spends $700 million per year in 
extensive research coverage of nearly 5,200 
companies across 83 countries. This massive effort 
continuously educates investors and decision 
makers around the world and often leads to 
improved governance and management. It also 
critically complements the firm’s market-making 
activities and further promotes transparency, 
enabling investors to make thoughtful choices 
around investing in capital markets. 
I would also like our shareholders to know that 
our market making is backed by approximately 
 $7 billion in support expenses, including over 
 $2 billion in technology spend alone each year. 
This investment allows us to maintain global 
trading systems and constantly improve upon risk 
management and efficiency. 
JPMorgan Chase deploys approximately $70 billion 
in capital to maintain our Markets franchise. This 
capital supports $500 billion in securities inventory (largely hedged) — and this inventory allows 
us to buy and sell $2 trillion (notional) in securities 
daily for our clients. 
Market making entails risk but is not 
particularly speculative.
The main objective of market makers is to continuously quote prices and diligently manage an inventory to transact at those prices, which includes 
assuming certain risks to support heavy volumes 
and orderly trading. Market makers have a moral 
obligation to try to make markets in good times 
UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY

and in bad. Part of our brand promise is to stand 
ready as the willing buyer and seller. In this, we 
have never failed. In addition, in most cases 
regarding government debt, where we serve as a 
government securities dealer, we are legally obligated to make markets. This constant visibility into 
prices provided by market makers fosters investor 
confidence, keeps fees low and promotes economic 
growth by attracting more investors.
Many large market participants — for example, 
hedge funds and high-frequency traders, among 
others — have no obligation to make markets. In 
fact, many of these market participants often “step 
out” of the markets and dramatically reduce liquidity specifically when market conditions are difficult. 
Market making is not particularly speculative since 
market makers generally hedge their positions, as 
you will see from some real life examples of the 
economics and risks. We earn revenue of approximately $100 million on a typical day. In the average year, the total is nearly $30 billion. On our 
$2 trillion in notional daily trading, this amounts to 
only one hundredth of a cent charged to the investor for these services — an extraordinarily low cost 
compared with any other market in the world. 
Now let’s take a look at the actual risk and results 
versus the hypothetical risk and results. The hypothetical global market shock of the CCAR stress 
test has us losing $18 billion in a single day and 
never recovering any of it. Let’s compare that to 
actual losses under real, actual market stress. 
Now consider these historical data points: First, 
over the last 10 years, the firm’s market-making 
business has never had a quarterly loss and has 
lost money on only 30 trading days. These loss days 
represent only 1% of total trading days, and the 
average loss on those days was $90 million. Second, 
when markets completely collapsed during the 
COVID-19 pandemic (from March 2 through March 
31, 2020, the stock market fell 16%, and bond 
spreads gapped out dramatically), J.P. Morgan’s 
market-making activities made money every day 
prior to the Federal Reserve’s major interventions, 
which stabilized the markets. During that entire 
month, we lost money on only two days but made 
$2.5 billion in Markets revenue for the month. And 
third, in the worst quarter ever in the markets following the 2008 failure of Lehman Brothers, we lost 
$1.7 billion, but we made $5.6 billion in Markets revenue for the full year. The firm as a whole did not 
lose money in any quarter that year. In 2009, there 
was a complete recovery in Markets, and we made 
$22 billion in Markets revenue. 
You can see that our actual performance under 
extreme stress isn’t even close to the hypothetical 
losses of the stress test. 
Another major fallacy is that derivatives are 
objects of financial destruction. In reality, derivatives are an essential part of managing financial 
risk and are used by investors, corporations, farmers, businesses, countries, governments and others to manage their risks. And more than 85% of 
derivatives are fairly basic forms of foreign 
exchange or interest rate swaps.
One last fallacy is that the repo markets are all 
about speculation. While it’s true that repo is used 
by certain investors to leverage up their positions, 
about 75% of repo is essential to normal money 
market functioning, i.e., is done by broker-dealers 
financing their actual inventory positions, money 
market funds investing their cash backed by highly 
rated collateral and clients hedging their positions. 
Market makers add confidence, liquidity and 
transparency to U.S. capital markets — market 
making helps stabilize markets and can reduce 
volatility. 
In addition, more liquidity, not less liquidity, will be 
needed to maintain market stability. Large banks 
keep an inventory of securities they can deploy in 
times of stress to help soothe markets; however, 
with the implementation of new regulations, banks 
now hold 70% as much inventory in securities as 
they did before the 2008 financial crisis, while the 
total size of the market has almost tripled. Higher 
capital requirements will accelerate this trend 
even further, impacting banks’ ability to deliver 
support to clients and markets in times when it is 
needed the most.

Washington’s Basel III endgame proposal 
damages market making, hurts Americans 
and drives activity to less transparent, less 
regulated markets. 
If this proposal is enacted as drafted: 
• Everyday consumer goods could be impacted. 
Households contending with inflation could also 
feel the effects of higher capital requirements 
on market-making activities when they shop. 
From beverage companies that need to manage 
aluminum costs to farms that need to protect 
against environmental risks, if the cost of hedging those risks increases, it could be reflected in 
what consumers pay for everything from a can 
of soda to meat products. 
• Mortgages and small business loans will be 
more expensive. Consumers seeking a mortgage — including first-time homebuyers and historically underserved, low- to moderate-income 
borrowers with smaller down payments — will 
face higher interest rates or will have a tougher 
time accessing one. This will occur not only 
because the cost of originating and holding 
these loans is higher but also because the cost 
of securitizing them will rise for banks, nonbanks and government agencies. Not only that, 
but the proposal will likely lead to reductions in 
the size of unfunded credit card lines, which will 
put pressure on FICO scores and thereby make it 
more difficult for some people to access other 
forms of retail credit such as mortgages. Again, 
this will have the greatest impact on low- to 
moderate-income borrowers who rely most 
heavily on credit cards for day-to-day spending 
and to build their credit history. It could even be 
argued that existing regulations go too far and 
that there is an opportunity to help underserved 
communities by dialing down regulations that 
lead to higher borrowing costs. This should be 
studied and the pros and cons analyzed. The 
same can be said for small business loans, which 
will become more expensive and less accessible.
• Saving for retirement or college will be harder. 
The cost of products that families count on to 
save for retirement or college will go up as a 
result of this proposal. Asset managers, money 
market funds and pension funds all buy, sell 
and safekeep securities and other financial 
instruments for American investors. Under the 
proposed rules, the cost of banking products 
used on behalf of clients each day — including 
brokerage, advisory, clearing and custody 
services — will go up and feed through to 
customers. That will lead to lower returns on 
retirement accounts, college funds and other 
long-term savings. 
• Government infrastructure projects and corporate development will become more expensive. Federal, state and local governments, as 
well as corporations and other institutions, rely 
on large banks for access to U.S. capital markets 
to fund development. If accessing capital markets becomes more expensive, it will have a ripple effect on the hiring of American workers, 
investment in research and development, and 
funding to build hospitals, roads and bridges, 
including the planned infrastructure projects 
from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
More market activity will move to unregulated 
institutions, out of sight from regulators and without the same level of consumer protections that 
Americans expect from their banks. Other market 
participants that don’t have holistic client relationships are less likely to provide liquidity to help 
stabilize markets. 
In volatile times, banks have been able to intermediate to help their clients and to work with the regulators. With new regulations, they may be less 
able to do so. There have been several times in the 
past few years where banks had ample liquidity 
and capital but were unable to rapidly increase 
their intermediation in the markets due to very 
rigid liquidity and capital requirements. Finally, 
the proposed rules increase the chance that the 
Federal Reserve will have to step in again — and 
this is not something they should want to do on a 
regular basis but only in an extreme emergency. 

UPDATE ON SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY

Staying Competitive in the 
Shrinking Public Markets 
In previous letters, I have described the diminishing role of public companies in the American financial system. From their peak in 1996 at 7,300, 
U.S. public companies now total 4,300 — the total 
should have grown dramatically, not shrunk. 
Meanwhile, the number of private U.S. companies 
backed by private equity firms — which does not 
include the rising number of companies owned by 
sovereign wealth funds and family offices — has 
grown from 1,900 to 11,200 over the last two 
decades. This trend is serious and may very well 
increase with more regulation and litigation 
coming. Along with a frank assessment of the 
regulation landscape, we really need to consider: 
Is this the outcome we want? 
There are good reasons for private markets, and 
some good outcomes result from them. For example, companies can stay private longer if they wish 
and raise more and different types of capital without going to the public markets. However, taking a 
wider view, I fear we may be driving companies 
from the public markets. The reasons are complex 
and may include factors such as intensified reporting requirements (including investors’ growing 
needs for environmental, social and governance 
information), higher litigation expenses, costly 
regulations, cookie-cutter board governance, 
shareholder activism, less compensation flexibility, 
less capital flexibility, heightened public scrutiny 
and the relentless pressure of quarterly earnings. 
Along with the universal proxy — which makes it 
easier to put poorly qualified directors on a board 
— the pressures to retreat from the public market 
are mounting. In addition, corporate governance 
principles are becoming more and more templated 
and formulaic, a negative trend. For example, 
proxy advisors may automatically judge directors 
unfavorably if they have a long tenure on the 
board, without a fair assessment of their actual 
contributions or experience. Another example is 
the constant battle by some proxy advisors who try 
to split the chairman and CEO role when there is no 
evidence this makes a company better off — in fact, 
today, lead directors generally hold most of the 
authorities previously assigned to the chairman. 
The governance of major corporations is evolving 
away from guidance by governance principles that 
focus on a company’s relationship to long-term 
economic value toward a bureaucratic compliance 
exercise. Good corporate governance is critical, and 
a little common sense would go a long way.
THE PRESSURE OF QUARTERLY 
EARNINGS COMPOUNDED BY BAD 
ACCOUNTING AND BAD DECISIONS
There is something very positive about detailed 
and disciplined quarterly financial and operating 
reporting. But company CEOs and boards of directors should resist the undue pressure of quarterly 
earnings, and it is clearly somewhat their fault 
when they don’t. However, it is naïve to think that 
the pressure doesn’t exist because companies that 
“disappoint” can face extensive criticism, particularly those with a new or young CEO. It’s possible 
for companies to take short-term actions to 
increase earnings, such as selling more product 
cheaply at the end of a quarter, cutting certain 
investments that may be terrific but can show 
accounting losses in the first year or two, or just 
deploying more aggressive accounting methods at 
times. Once shortcuts like this begin, people all 
over the company understand that it is okay to 
“stretch” to meet your numbers. This could put you 
on a treadmill to ruin. Obviously, a company should 
not resort to these tactics, but it does happen in 
the public markets — and it’s probably less likely in 
the private markets. 
THE HIJACKING OF ANNUAL 
SHAREHOLDER MEETINGS
One of the reasons it is less desirable to be a public 
company is because of the spiraling frivolousness of 
the annual shareholder meeting, which has 
devolved into mostly a showcase of grandstanding 
and competing special interest groups. We should 

STAYING COMPETITIVE IN THE SHRINKING PUBLIC MARKETS

treat shareholders with tremendous respect — and 
we do. At JPMorgan Chase, we are constantly talking 
with our investors — our directors, our lead director 
and our corporate governance experts visit most of 
our major investors whether they be direct owners 
or asset managers who manage the money for others. Meeting with your shareholders and investors is 
critical, but the annual shareholder meeting itself 
has become ineffective. We should try to come up 
with a far more constructive alternative.
THE UNDUE INFLUENCE OF PROXY 
ADVISORS
There are essentially two main proxy advisors in 
the United States. One is called Institutional 
Shareholder Services (ISS), and the second is 
called Glass Lewis. These proxy advisors started 
out providing reams of data from companies to 
help their institutional investor clients vote on 
proxy matters (information on executive compensation, stock returns, detail on directors, policies 
and so on). However, they soon also began to provide advice on how shareholders should vote on 
proxy matters. And, in fact, institutional investors 
generally execute their voting on an ISS or Glass 
Lewis platform, which often includes a clear statement of the advisory service’s position. 
I should also point out, because it may be relevant, 
that ISS is owned by Deutsche Boerse, a German 
company, and Glass Lewis is owned by Peloton 
Capital, a Canadian private equity firm. I question 
whether American corporate governance should be 
determined by for-profit international institutions 
that may have their own strong feelings about what 
constitutes good corporate governance.
While asset managers and institutional 
investors have a fiduciary responsibility to 
make their own decisions, it is increasingly 
clear that proxy advisors have undue 
influence.
Asset managers (who manage money on behalf of 
others) and institutional investors (e.g., pension 
plans and endowments) may rely on a variety of 
information sources to support their valuation 
decision-making process. While data and recommendations may form pieces of the information 
mosaic, their votes should ultimately be based on 
an independent application of their own voting 
guidelines and policies. To the extent they use recommendations from proxy advisors in their decision-making processes, they should disclose that 
they do so and should be satisfied that the information upon which they are relying is accurate and 
relevant. However, many companies would argue 
that this information is frequently not balanced, 
not representative of the full view and not accurate. In addition, companies complain that they 
often cannot get the data corrected, and, therefore, a vote may go uncorrected. 
Almost all asset managers receive proxy advisor 
data and recommendations; while some asset managers vote completely independently of this information, the majority do not. Most asset managers 
have formed corporate governance or stewardship 
committees that are responsible for their voting, 
and these committee positions are often held not by 
portfolio managers and research analysts (i.e., the 
people buying and analyzing the individual securities) but by stewardship experts. While it is good to 
have stewardship experts, the reality is that many 
of these committees default large portions of what 
they do to proxy advisors and, more troubling, make 
it harder for actual portfolio managers to override 
this decision making. 
Some have argued that it’s too hard and too expensive to review the large number of proxies and proxy 
proposals — this is both lazy and wrong. If issues are 
important to a company, they should be important 
to the shareholder — for the most part, only a handful of proposals are important to companies. 
We are making enhancements to J.P. Morgan 
Asset Management’s proxy voting processes to 
amplify the role of portfolio managers and to 
address the perception of asset managers’ 
reliance on third-party advisor voting 
recommendations. 
Enhancements to the firm’s internal proxy voting 
process will include: 

STAYING COMPETITIVE IN THE SHRINKING PUBLIC MARKETS 

• More portfolio manager participation in proxy 
committee decision making. The firm has significantly expanded the representation of portfolio managers on its North American Proxy 
Committee in an effort to increase the diversity 
of viewpoints represented on the committee. As 
part of this change, and in recognition that portfolio managers, as fiduciaries, may differ in their 
views on how to vote on particular proposals 
depending on a mandate’s investment strategy 
and guidelines, we are broadening our capabilities to support voting results that may vary 
across our platform. 
• Diminished role of proxy advisor recommendations. J.P. Morgan Asset Management makes its 
own independent proxy voting decisions (based 
on deep fundamental research) and stands 
behind the depth and rigor of its processes and 
historical information advantage. In most cases, 
the firm will only use proxy advisory firms for 
research, data and technical mechanics of vote 
transmission and not for outsourced recommendations. By the end of 2024, J.P. Morgan Asset 
Management generally will have eliminated 
third-party proxy advisor voting recommendations from its internally developed voting systems.?Additionally, the firm will work with thirdparty proxy voting advisors to remove their 
voting recommendations from research reports 
they provide to J.P. Morgan Asset Management 
by the 2025 proxy season.
• Other enhancements. We are working to give a 
company and its management even greater 
access to the ultimate decision makers; to raise 
critical issues to a company as early as possible 
in a constructive and proactive way; and to be 
willing to tell companies how we have voted 
once our decision is made rather than waiting 
until votes are finally counted.
Taken together, these steps are designed to 
respond to a growing perception (and, I believe, 
reality) that the asset management industry generally places undue reliance on proxy advisors in 
how proxies are voted. We believe these actions 
will strengthen our relationships with our clients 
and with companies while helping to build trust 
among shareholders, investors and companies.
THE BENEFITS AND RISKS OF 
PRIVATE CREDIT
I have already mentioned some of the benefits of 
private credit, and I’ll now mention some more. 
Many people in the private credit arena are very 
smart and creative and want to help the companies they invest in navigate through market shoals. 
They can move quickly, discreetly and flexibly. 
Most generally understand that bad accounting 
drives bad decisions, and their goal is to make the 
right decisions for the future of the company.
On the other hand, not all players are that good. 
And problems in the private credit market caused 
by the bad players can leak onto the good ones, 
even though private credit money is locked up for 
years. If investors feel mistreated, they will cry 
foul, and the government will respond by putting 
a laser focus on the business. It’s a reasonable 
assumption that at some point regulations will 
focus on the private markets as they do on the 
public markets. 
This scrutiny will include a look at how private 
credit values its assets, which isn’t as transparent 
as public market valuations. In addition, private 
market loans commonly lack liquidity in the secondary market and are not generally supported by 
in-depth market research.
New financial products that grow extremely rapidly often become an area of unexpected risk in 
the markets. Frequently, the weaknesses of new 
products, in this case private credit loans, may 
only be seen and exposed in bad markets, which 
private credit loans have not yet faced. When 
credit spreads gap out, when interest rates go up 
and when some leveraged companies suffer in the 
recession, we will find out how those loans survive 
stress testing. In addition, they can create a little 
bit of a “credit crunch” for borrowers since it 
might be hard for private creditors to roll over 
loans under those conditions. Under stress conditions, private creditors would have to charge exorbitant prices that companies simply cannot afford 
in order to book the new loan at par. Banks are in a 
slightly different position. 

STAYING COMPETITIVE IN THE SHRINKING PUBLIC MARKETS

panies through good times and bad, seeking to 
retain them as long-term clients across many 
areas of the bank. They can and do take “losses” 
that help the client maintain the franchise. But an 
asset manager must act as a “fiduciary” of other 
people’s money and cannot lend based on a moral 
obligation or potential future relationship.
Recently, we have been witnessing a convergence 
between the public and private markets. But it’s 
too soon to say how this ultimately will play out, 
particularly if we go through a recessionary cycle. 
 
A BANK’S STRENGTH: PROVIDING 
FLEXIBLE CAPITAL
Banks generally try to be there for their borrowers 
in difficult times — striving to roll over loans, renegotiate terms and raise additional capital. Banks 
do this for multiple reasons: They normally feel an 
obligation to help their clients, they have longterm relationships and they can commonly earn 
other sources of revenue from client-driven transactions. Banks can also flex their capital and lending base as needed by their clients. This is because 
a bank can and should make decisions to help com39

I always enjoy sharing what I’ve learned from 
watching others, reading and experiencing through 
my own journey.
BENEFITING FROM THE OODA LOOP
The military, which often operates in extreme 
intensity of life and death and in the fog and 
uncertainty of war, uses the term “OODA loop” 
(Observe, Orient, Decide, Act — repeat), a strategic 
process of constant review, analysis, decision 
making and action. One cannot overemphasize the 
importance of observation and a full assessment 
— the failure to do so leads to some of the greatest 
mistakes, not only in war but also in business and 
government. 
A full assessment is critical.
To properly manage any business situation, you 
need to perform a full and complete assessment 
of it. In business, you have to understand your 
competitors, their distribution, their economics, 
their innovations, and their strengths and weaknesses. You also need to understand customers 
and their changing preferences, along with your 
own costs, your people and their skills. Then 
there’s knowing how other factors fit in, like technology, risk, motivations … hope you get the point. 
For countries, you need a thorough grasp of their 
economies, strengths and weaknesses, population 
and education, access to raw materials, laws and 
regulations, history and culture. Research, data 
and analytics should be at a very detailed level and 
constantly reassessed. Only after you complete 
this diligent study can you start to make plans with 
a high degree of success. 
Get on the road — it builds knowledge and 
culture. 
I have frequently wondered about all the nonstop 
road trips, client meetings, briefings, greetings, 
bus trips, and visits to call centers, operating 
centers and branches, regulators and government 
officials, among others: Did they make a difference? The answer is absolutely yes because they 
enabled a process of constant learning, assessment and modification of best practices — gaining 
insights from employees to clients to competitors. 
Employees will tell you what you are doing well or 
poorly if you simply ask them, and they know you 
want to hear the real answer. Curiosity is a form 
of humility — acknowledging that you don’t know 
everything. Responding to curiosity allows other 
people to speak freely. Facts and details matter 
and inform a deeper and deeper analysis that 
allows you to continually revise and update your 
plans. This, of course, also means that you are 
constantly admitting prior mistakes. 
You need to shed sacred cows, seek out blind 
spots and challenge the status quo.
Very often companies or individuals develop narratives based upon beliefs that are very hard to 
dislodge but are often wrong — and they can lead 
to terrible mistakes. A few examples will suffice. 
Stripe, Inc. built a payments business by working 
with developers — something we never would 
have imagined but might have figured out if we 
had tried to seek out what others were doing in 
this area. Branches were being closed, both at 
Bank One and Chase, because the assumption 
was that they would not be needed in the future. 
We underinvested for years in the wealth management business because we were always 
focused on the value of deposits versus investments. Question everything.
Management Lessons: Thinking, 
Deciding and Taking Action – 
Deliberately and with Heart

MANAGEMENT LESSONS: THINKING, DECIDING AND TAKING ACTION — DELIBERATELY AND WITH HEART

Use your brains to figure out the truth — not to 
justify what you already think.
It’s often hard to change your own attitudes and 
beliefs, especially those you may have held on to 
for some time. But you must be open to it. When 
you learn something that is different from what 
you thought, it may affect many conclusions you 
have, not just one. Try not to allow yourself to 
become rigid or “weaponized,” where other 
employees or interest groups jazz you up so much 
that you become a weapon on their behalf. This 
makes it much harder to see things clearly for 
yourself. When people disagree with you, seek 
out where they may be partially right. This opens 
the door for a deeper understanding and avoids 
binary thinking.
It’s hard to see certain long-term trends, but 
you must try. 
There is too much emphasis on short-term, 
monthly data and too little on long-term trends 
and on what might happen in the future that would 
influence long-term outcomes. For example, today 
there is tremendous interest in monthly inflation 
data, although it seems to me that every long-term 
trend I see increases inflation relative to the last 
20 years. Huge fiscal spending, the trillions needed 
each year for the green economy, the remilitarization of the world and the restructuring of global 
trade — all are inflationary. I’m not sure models 
could pick this up. And you must use judgment if 
you want to evaluate impacts like these. 
Also, a block of time as short as one year is an artificial framework for judging the impact of longterm trends that could easily play out over years. 
A helpful exercise is to think “future back,” in 
which you imagine different future outcomes, 
including the ones you want, and then work backward to events that are happening today (or that 
might happen or that you cause to happen), closely 
examining the connections between those events 
and your projected or desired outcomes. Those 
connections inform your risk and R&D planning. 
Similarly, when companies compare the attributes 
of their products and services with their competitors, they usually only consider where they are 
versus their competitors. But nothing is static — 
they should consider where their competitors will 
be in the future. Conditions are always changing, 
crises are always emerging. When analyzing the 
playing field, it is better to assume that your competitors are strong and are already in the process 
of improving and innovating. This minimizes the 
chance of arrogance leading to complacency.
DECISION MAKING AND ACTING 
(HAVE A PROCESS)
There is a time for an individual to decide 
and act.
Sometimes you should take the time to measure 
twice and cut once. And then sometimes making a 
quick decision is better than delaying. You should 
try to distinguish between the two. For example, 
with decisions that are hard to reverse, it’s usually 
better to go slow. With other decisions where you 
can test, learn, probe and change direction, it’s 
often better to go fast. It’s been my experience 
that it’s hard for some people to actually decide 
and act. This could be from analysis paralysis, lack 
of “perfect” information, fear of failure or the feeling that full consensus is needed before a decision 
can be reached. But whatever it is, it can slow 
down and possibly seriously damage a company. 
To get people to think like decision makers and 
take a strong point of view, we like to ask, “What 
would you do if you were king or queen for a day?” 
It helps shift the direction to individual decision 
making. We also ask questions like, “What would 

MANAGEMENT LESSONS: THINKING, DECIDING AND TAKING ACTION — DELIBERATELY AND WITH HEART

you wish for if you knew X was going to happen?” 
(for example, higher interest rates). Decision 
making takes a mix of courage, grit and guts.
One exercise that I find useful (and sometimes 
painful) is to draw up a list of important decisions 
that need to be made — the ones I often avoid confronting. So I take time every Sunday to think 
about these tough issues and almost always make 
progress. Progress doesn’t always mean that you 
come to the final conclusion — sometimes it’s just a 
very rational next step that can put you on a path 
to the final decision. 
Try to have a good decision-making process.
Try to give yourself the time to decide. Make sure 
you speak with the right people and make sure the 
right people are in the room. Information should 
be fully shared. People should be made very comfortable with open debate. Quite often, the “right” 
answer is simply waiting to be found — you don’t 
have to guess. 
Crowdsourcing, compromise, consensus and 
committees have benefits and risks.
There are huge benefits to crowdsourcing intelligence. It is a form of full assessment, a strategy 
for getting the best ideas and challenging the status quo. We should do this for almost every major 
decision. It is perfectly fine on some occasions to 
compromise and gain consensus, particularly on 
decisions that are not critical and can easily be 
reversed. Often people spend too much time 
debating issues that are simply not that important; it’s better to decide and move on. Also, 
before you compromise, you should know exactly 
what you want to achieve and the consequences 
of any tradeoffs. However, sometimes compromise and consensus cannot work and only lead to 
a feel-good decision that is probably wrong — this 
could be the road to ruin. 
The use of committees can be good when done 
properly. For example, if our risk committees 
could do a full assessment and crowdsource all 
potential risks, that would lead to better decision 
making. I will give one very personal and painful 
example, which is when we had a major trading 
scandal, called The London Whale. The scandal 
was not caused by the complexity of the trade but 
rather the failure to go to the proper Risk committee for a thorough review, which should have 
happened but didn’t. I have no doubt that had the 
trade been raised there, the flaws would have 
been exposed immediately, thereby dramatically 
reducing or eliminating the problem. On the other 
hand, the opposite can happen when a committee, with everyone staring at each other, devolves 
into herd-like behavior with people looking for 
confirmation and ending up with a compromise 
that is a poor choice. 
Good leadership involves great observation and 
the ability to act, but there is more …
THE SECRET SAUCE OF LEADERSHIP 
(HAVE A HEART)
You need to earn trust and respect with your 
employees.
You can be great at assessment, you can be brilliant and you may often be willing to act. But all of 
that is not good enough for “complete” leadership. 
To become a true leader, you need to be trusted 
and you must earn your respect, every day. People 
have to know that you do not have ulterior motives 
and that you’re trying to do the right thing — not 
trying to burnish your personal reputation. Good 
people want to work for people they respect, and 
they will not respect people who take all the credit 
and share all the blame. People need to know that 
even when you make mistakes, you’re willing to 
admit them and take corrective action. And there 
is more …

MANAGEMENT LESSONS: THINKING, DECIDING AND TAKING ACTION — DELIBERATELY AND WITH HEART

The importance of vision, communication and 
inspiration.
The reason I’ve always hesitated to talk about 
“vision” is because often it is the basic BS of 
corporate speak — that somehow if you impart 
your vision to people, they will take the mountain. 
What it really is all about is this: After you’ve done 
your full assessment and decision making, you can 
then continuously educate, explain, train, simplify, 
propel and fight. But this only works if people 
know you are in the trenches with them, if they 
understand the mission and if they are there side 
by side with your effort. 
We know that bureaucracy can lead to politics, 
corporate stasis and terrible decisions. So you can 
communicate your vision about how to fight 
bureaucracy by telling stories about the silly things 
we do — but with a smile — and then by showing 
people that you will actually fix the problems. 
Finally, your vision needs to be clear, coherent and 
consistent. Within an organization, people very 
quickly pick up the pattern of management saying 
one thing but doing another. Because if words and 
actions are inconsistent (for example, and I could 
give many, when we say we want employees to be 
treated with respect, but we allow a jerk to be their 
boss), confidence in leadership will be eroded.
Heart cannot be overstated.
Heart matters. And it makes a difference when 
people know and see that you actually care. One 
example: Many years ago when I was new to 
JPMorgan Chase, I learned that the company’s 
security guards had been outsourced — to save 
money. Since after outsourcing, when the same 
guards continued coming to work every day at the 
same salary, I wondered, “How could this be?” 
(FYI, this was brought to my attention by the head 
of the Service Employees International Union, who 
came to see me over the objection of my management team.) The reason we were saving money is 
because the healthcare benefits were cut in half 
for the guards and their family members (currently 
worth approximately $15,000 a year), and the savings were split with us. This was a heartless thing 
to do — and the second I found out, I reversed the 
decision. JPMorgan Chase’s success will not be 
built off the backs of our guards — it will be the 
result of fair treatment of all of our employees — 
and we’re thankful that many of those guards are 
still with our company today.
You know heart and soul when you see it in effect 
on sports teams or with “the boys in the boat” — 
it’s a beautiful thing to watch. It’s not as obvious, 
but it happens in business, too.
It’s essential to build trust with your 
customers, constituencies and, yes, even 
competitors.
Of course, I’m not bringing this up as a matter of 
corporate governance or a corporation’s purpose: 
A business should, over the long run, try to maximize shareholder value. It is completely obvious 
that running a decent business —treating everyone 
ethically and earning trust and respect in all your 
communities — is not only fundamental to shareholder value but also to a healthy society. 

MANAGEMENT LESSONS: THINKING, DECIDING AND TAKING ACTION — DELIBERATELY AND WITH HEART

A Pivotal Moment for America 
and the Free Western World: 
Strategy and Policy Matter
In past years, I have written extensively about public policy issues. It is important to engage in these 
conversations, particularly around domestic 
economic policy because policy matters. While 
JPMorgan Chase can execute specific plans to 
improve outcomes for customers and communities, there is no replacement for effective government policies that add to the general well-being of 
the country. A stronger and more prosperous 
country will make us a stronger company. 
As CEO of this company, every year I visit numerous countries around the globe. I meet with foreign government leaders, presidents and prime 
ministers, business leaders, and civic and academic experts, which allows me to learn a significant amount about how public policy is executed 
around the world. It also reinforces some of the 
critical values and virtues that are essential to a 
healthy country. 
Every time I see the American flag, it reminds me 
of the values and virtues of this country and its 
founding principles conceived in liberty and dedicated to the notion that all men and women are 
created equal. Talk with someone who has recently 
become a naturalized citizen or watch a ceremony 
where groups of people take the oath to America, 
and you will see extraordinary joy and newfound 
pride. They now live free, with individual rights 
protected by the Constitution and with their life 
and the well-being of their family and community 
protected by the U.S. military. As Americans, we 
have much to be grateful for and much to defend.
If you read the newspaper from virtually any day 
of any year since World War II, there is abundant 
coverage on wars — hot and cold — inflation, recession, polarized politics, terrorist attacks, migration 
and starvation. As appalling as these events have 
been, the world was generally on a path to becoming stronger and safer. When terrible events 
happen, we tend to overestimate the effect they 
will have on the global economy. Recent events, 
however, may very well be creating risks that could 
eclipse anything since World War II — we should 
not take them lightly. 
February 24, 2022 is another day in history that 
will live in infamy. On that day, 190,000 Russian 
soldiers invaded a free and democratic European 
country — importantly, somewhat protected by the 
threat of nuclear blackmail. Russia’s invasion of 
Ukraine and the subsequent abhorrent attack on 
Israel and ongoing violence in the Middle East 
should have punctured many assumptions about 
the direction of future safety and security, bringing 
us to this pivotal time in history. America and the 
free Western world can no longer maintain a false 
sense of security based on the illusion that dictatorships and oppressive nations won’t use their 
economic and military powers to advance their 
aims — particularly against what they perceive as 
weak, incompetent and disorganized Western 
democracies. In a troubled world, we are reminded 
that national security is and always will be paramount, even if its importance seems to recede in 
tranquil times.
The fallout from these events should also lay to 
rest the idea that America can stand alone. Of 
course, U.S. leaders must always put America 
first, but global peace and order are vital to 
American interests. Only America has the full 
capability to lead and coalesce the Western world, 
though we must do so respectfully and in partnership with our allies. Without cohesiveness and 
unity with our allies, autocratic forces will divide 
and conquer the bickering democracies. America 
needs to lead with its strengths — not only its 

A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR AMERICA AND THE FREE WESTERN WORLD: STRATEGY AND POLICY MATTER

military but also its economic, diplomatic and 
moral forces. And now we must do so as America’s 
leadership is being challenged around the world. 
There is nothing more important.
Policy and strategy matter, and it’s important 
to be engaged.
In our increasingly complex world, there is a vital 
interrelationship between domestic and foreign 
economic policy, particularly around trade, investment, national security and other issues. And, of 
course, while American voters and leadership set 
U.S. foreign policy, being a constructive part of the 
global conversation has become more important 
than ever. 
If you doubt how important public policy is for the 
health of a country, you need to look no further 
than the recent history of Greece, Ireland or 
Singapore. Each of these countries, starting from 
deeply challenging places, implemented effective 
government and policies that have done a great 
job of lifting up their people when many thought it 
wasn’t possible. Sweden is another great example 
of a country with good broad-based policies that 
have succeeded at precisely what we all may want 
— a dynamic, innovative, free-market economy 
(Sweden actually has fewer government-owned 
enterprises than America) and safety nets that 
work. Conversely, you need to look no further than 
North Korea or Venezuela to see the complete 
destruction and havoc that terrible public policies 
(often in the name of the people) can cultivate.
Strategy by its nature must be comprehensive. In 
the rest of this section, I try to answer the question: 
What must we do to ensure that the world stays 
safe, not only for America but for freedom and 
democracy? A comprehensive strategy entails four 
important pillars, and we must succeed at each:
Maintain American leadership (including 
military).
Achieve long-term economic success with 
our allies.
Strengthen our nation domestically.
Deepen focus and resolve on addressing 
our most pressing challenges.
COALESCING THE WESTERN WORLD — A 
UNIQUELY AMERICAN TASK 
Only America has the full capabilities of military 
might, economic power and the principles that 
most people around the world yearn for — based 
on “liberty and justice for all” and the proposition 
that all people are created equal. America 
remains the bastion of freedom and the arsenal 
of democracy. 
There is no alternative to American leadership.
In the free and democratic Western world, and, in 
fact, for many other countries, there is no real or 
good alternative to America. The only other potential superpower is China. Other nations know they 
can rely on the founding principles of America. If 
we reach out our hand, most nations will happily 
take that hand. America is still the most prosperous nation on the planet, which not only can guarantee our military strength but also positions us to 
help our allies develop and grow their nations 
(though we should minimize the “our way or the 
highway” type of behavior). This leadership is 
needed today to help Ukraine stay free in its battle 
with Russia.
Most of the world wants American leadership.
America continues to be the envy of much of the 
world, and as we’ve seen with the challenges at 
our borders, there is a reason people want to 
come here and not to autocratic nations. If you 
opened America’s borders to the rest of the world, 
I have little doubt that hundreds of millions of 
people would want to move here. By contrast, not 
many would want to emigrate to autocratic 
nations. Also, I have little doubt that if most investors across the globe could only invest in one country, they would choose the United States. Beyond 
our country’s borders, people and nations around 
the world understand the role that America has 
played in promoting world peace — known as Pax 
Americana. For the most part, Pax Americana has 
kept the world relatively peaceful since World War 
II and helped lead to enormous global economic 
prosperity, which has helped lift 1.3 billion people 
out of poverty.

A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR AMERICA AND THE FREE WESTERN WORLD: STRATEGY AND POLICY MATTER 

Modern America does not engage in economic 
coercion or foreign wars to steal land or treasure. 
The fact that some of our foreign excursions might 
have been misguided does not negate this. We 
helped rebuild Europe and Japan after the devastation of World War II, and we, with our allies, have 
helped create global institutions to maintain 
peace. We are still trusted.
First and foremost, the Western world needs 
unquestioned military might — peace through 
strength.
“We know only too well that war comes not when 
the forces of freedom are strong, but when they 
are weak,” said Ronald Reagan in 1980.
So far, the Western world has done a good job in 
strengthening military alliances in response to the 
war in Ukraine. Ukraine is essentially the front line 
that needs immediate support. Providing that support is the best way to counter autocratic forces 
that would seek to weaken the Western world, particularly America. But the ongoing wars in Ukraine 
and the Middle East could become far worse and 
spread in unpredictable ways. Most important, the 
specter of nuclear weapons — probably still the 
greatest threat to mankind — hovers as the ultimate 
decider, which should strike deep fear in all our 
hearts. The best protection starts with an unyielding resolve to do whatever we need to do to maintain the strongest military on the planet — a commitment that is well within our economic capability.
American leadership requires not only the 
military but also the full “symphony of power.”
Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, in his 
book?Exercise of Power, writes extensively in the 
first chapter about “the symphony of power.” He 
makes the critical point that America has often 
overused and misused military power and has 
massively underused other muscles — diplomacy, 
intelligence, communication (explaining to the 
world the benefits of democracy and free enterprise) and comprehensive economic policy. 
America has the most extensive group of partners, 
friends and allies — both military and economic — 
that the world has probably ever seen. We should 
put this to better use. 
The American public ought to hear more about 
why this is so important.
International isolationism has run through 
American foreign policy throughout our history, 
frequently with good reason. The chant, “Don’t get 
involved in foreign wars” was often right. That 
said, the American public should remember that 
even after the Revolutionary War, we did, in fact, 
have British and French armies on our soil. The 
sinking of American merchant and passenger ships 
during World War I and the surprise attack on 
Pearl Harbor in World War II brought isolationism 
to a close for a time. America is never far from 
being dragged into terrible conflicts. Global wars 
come to our shores whether we like it or not — we 
need to stay engaged. 
In perilous periods of history when our allies and 
other democracies were under serious assault, 
great American leaders have inspired the American people — through words and actions — to 
stand up to help and defend them. Staying on the 
sidelines during battles of autocracy and democracy, between dictatorship and freedom, is simply 
not an option for America today. Ukraine is the 
front line of democracy. If the war goes badly 
for Ukraine, you may see the splintering of Pax 
Americana, which would be a disaster for the 
whole free world. Ukraine’s struggle is our struggle, and ensuring their victory is ensuring America 
first. It is imperative that our national leaders 
explain to the American people what is at stake 
and make a powerful case – with energy, consistency and clarity – for our strong enduring commitment to Ukraine’s survival for as long as it 
takes (and it could take years).
One last point: Ukraine needs our help immediately, 
but it’s important to understand that much of the 
money that America is directing to Ukraine is for 
purchasing weapons and equipment, most of which 
will be built in America. Not only is our aid helping 
Ukraine, but it is going directly to American manufacturers, and it is helping the country rebuild our 
military industrial capacity for the next generation. 

A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR AMERICA AND THE FREE WESTERN WORLD: STRATEGY AND POLICY MATTER

STRENGTHENING OUR POSITION WITH 
A COMPREHENSIVE, GLOBAL 
ECONOMIC SECURITY STRATEGY
Sustaining America’s economic strength is a bedrock for our long-term military strength. There are 
many things we need to do to strengthen the U.S. 
economy, and I talk about that later in this section. 
This discussion is about foreign economic policies 
— the economic battlefield.
The whole Western world is rethinking and 
reimagining its military strategies and alliances. 
We need to do the same for our economic strategies and alliances, but we should be guided by a 
comprehensive global strategy that deals with 
critical issues. Done properly, such a strategy 
would help strengthen, coalesce and possibly be 
the glue that holds together Western democratic 
alliances over decades.
Foreign economic policy involves trade and investment, export controls, secure and resilient supply 
chains, and the execution of sanctions and any 
related industrial policies. It must also include 
development finance — think of the “Belt and Road” 
efforts in China — which are critical to most developing nations. This framework should tell us not only 
how to deal with our allies but also how to work with 
nonaligned nations around the world. These strategies should not be aimed against any one country 
(such as China) but rather be focused on keeping 
the world safe for democracy and free enterprise. 
Economic national security is paramount — 
both for the United States and for our allies.
It is a valid point that the Western world — both 
government and business — essentially underestimated the growing strength and potential threat of 
China. It’s also true that China has been comprehensively and strategically focused on these economic issues, all while we slept. But let’s not cry 
over spilled milk — let’s just fix it. 
We missed the potential threat from three vantage 
points. The first is companies’ overreliance on 
China as the sole link in their supply chain, which 
can create vulnerabilities and reduces resiliency. 
But to the extent this involves everyday items, like 
clothes, sneakers, vaccine compounds and consumer goods, this dependency is not as critical or 
complex and will eventually be sorted out. 
The second is the most critical. The United States 
cannot rely on any potential adversaries for materials essential to our national security — think rare 
earths, 5G and semiconductors, penicillin and 
materials critical to essential pharmaceuticals, 
among others. We also cannot be sharing vital 
technologies that can enhance an adversary’s 
military capabilities. The United States should 
properly and narrowly define these issues and 
then act unilaterally, if necessary, to fix them. 
The third is also complex, which is countering 
unfair competition or “mercantilist” behavior in 
critical industries; think electric vehicles, renewable energy and AI, among others. Examples of 
this would be where a state, any state, uses government powers, capital, subsidies or other means 
to dominate critical industries and deeply damage 
the economic position of other nations. Weakening 
a country economically can render it a virtual 
“vassal state,” reliant on potential adversaries for 
essential goods and services, which also weakens 
it militarily. We cannot cede our important 
resources and capabilities to potential adversaries. 
All these issues can be resolved, though they will 
take time and need devoted effort. 
Every nation will have different national security 
issues. For example, Europe in general and countries like India, Japan and Korea need reliable, 
affordable and secure energy; many nations would 
put food security as their top concern. This means 
that we must work with our allies to accomplish 
our own goals and to help them accomplish theirs. 
We have extraordinary common interests in our 
joint security: We must hang together — because if 
we don’t, we will assuredly hang separately. 
We already engage in trade — improving it is 
good economics and great geopolitics.
We must have a better understanding of trade. 
As a nation, we refuse to get into genuine trade 
discussions, but this ignores the complete and 
obvious truth — we already have trade relationships with all these countries. Approximately 92% 

A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR AMERICA AND THE FREE WESTERN WORLD: STRATEGY AND POLICY MATTER 

of the world’s consumers live outside the United 
States. Increased trade allows our workers and 
farmers to access those markets. We should negotiate trade agreements that can achieve more, 
economically, for ourselves and our allies, as well 
as meet all of our national security needs. While it 
is appropriate to use trade to continue to nudge 
allies in the right direction around human rights 
and climate, this objective should be subordinated 
to our national interests of long-term security. 
Negotiating must be done in concert with our allied 
nations so as not to cause a fissure in economic 
relations. This is critical — strong economic bonds 
will help ensure strong military alliances. The Inflation Reduction Act has much good in it (more on this 
later), but it angered many of our allies. To them, 
the bill was by America and for America, and, subsequently, they felt a need to match it so their businesses would not be disadvantaged. The terms of 
the legislation could have been better negotiated 
with our allies in mind, strengthening our economic 
ties with the free world. 
We should also immediately re-enter, if possible, 
the prior negotiated Trans-Pacific Partnership 
agreement. Not only is it good for the economy, 
but it also could be a brilliant, strategic, economic 
security move — an economic alliance that binds 
us with 11 other important countries (including 
Australia, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore and Vietnam). Geopolitically and strategically, 
this might be one of the most important moves to 
counter China. While this is a challenging step, our 
political leaders need to explain and lead — and 
not be afraid of dealing with the tough issues.?We 
also need to acknowledge that there have been 
real negative job impacts as a result of trade, 
which are usually concentrated around certain 
areas and businesses. So any new trade policy 
should be combined with a greatly enhanced Trade 
Adjustment Assistance program, which provides 
retraining, income assistance and relocation for 
those workers directly impacted by trade. 
Trade is realpolitik, and the recent cancellation of 
future liquified natural gas (LNG) projects is a good 
example of this fact. The projects were delayed 
mainly for political reasons — to pacify those who 
believe that gas is bad and that oil and gas projects should simply be stopped. This is not only 
wrong but also enormously naïve. One of the best 
ways to reduce CO2 for the next few decades is to 
use gas to replace coal. When oil and gas prices 
skyrocketed last winter, nations around the world — 
wealthy and very climate-conscious nations like 
France, Germany and the Netherlands, as well as 
lower-income nations like Indonesia, the Philippines 
and Vietnam that could not afford the higher cost — 
started to turn back to their coal plants. This highlights the importance of safe, secure and affordable 
energy. Second, the export of LNG is a great economic boon for the United States. But most important is the realpolitik goal: Our allied nations that 
need secure and affordable energy resources, 
including critical nations like Japan, Korea and most 
of our European allies, would like to be able to 
depend on the United States for energy. This now 
puts them in a difficult position — they may have to 
look elsewhere for such supplies, turning to Iran, 
Qatar, the United Arab Emirates or maybe even 
Russia. We need to minimize anything that can tear 
at our economic bonds with our allies.
The strength of our domestic production of energy 
gives us a “power advantage” — cheaper and more 
reliable energy, which creates economic and geopolitical advantages.
Industrial policy is now necessary, but it 
should be carefully constructed and limited.
In some cases, industrial policy (using government 
resources to subsidize investments to help make 
businesses more competitive) may be the only 
solution for quickly building up the industries we 
need (rare earths and semiconductors, among 
others) to guarantee resilient national security. 
The IRA and CHIPS Act are good examples of this 
and government has to get it right. 
Such policy can also be used to help combat unfair 
competitive policies of nations that are using state 
capitalism and state control to dominate critical 
industries. However, when crafting industrial policy, 
the function of government needs to be narrowly 
defined and kept simple; i.e., governmental jurisdiction should be limited to very specific products and 

A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR AMERICA AND THE FREE WESTERN WORLD: STRATEGY AND POLICY MATTER

probably to what we know works, such as tax credits and, to a lesser extent, loan guarantees. And 
industrial policy should include twin provisions: 
1) strict limitations on political interference, like 
social policies, and 2) specific permitting requirements, which, if not drastically improved, will badly 
inhibit our ability to make investments and allow 
infrastructure to be built. Adding social policy, politics and matters other than simple tax credits dramatically reduces the economic efficiency of industrial policy and creates conditions for corporate 
America to feed at the trough of government 
largess. We should quickly address how we can 
improve on already executed legislation. We do not 
want to look back and have great regrets about how 
so much of this policy work failed. 
There are those who argue that the U.S. government needs much more far-reaching industrial 
policy to be able to micromanage and accomplish 
its many ambitious objectives. To those I say, read 
further in this section about how ineffective so 
many government policies have been.
We should be tough, but we should engage 
with China.
Over the last 20 years, China has been executing 
a more comprehensive economic strategy than we 
have. The country’s leaders have successfully 
grown their nation and, depending on how you 
measure it, have the first or second largest economy in the world. That said, many question the 
current economic focus of China’s leadership as 
they don’t have everything figured out. While 
China has become the largest trading partner to 
many countries around the world, its own GDP per 
person is $13,000. And the country continues to be 
beset by many economic and domestic issues.
China has its own national security concerns. The 
country is located in a very politically complex part 
of the world, and many of China’s actions have 
caused its neighbors (e.g., Japan, Korea, Philippines, 
among others) to start to re-arm and, in fact, draw 
closer to the United States. It also surprises many 
Americans to hear that while our country is 100% 
energy sufficient, China needs to import 10 million 
barrels of oil a day. It is clear that China’s new leadership has set a different course, with a much more 
intense focus on national security, military capability and internal development. That is their right, and 
we simply need to adjust to it.
America still has an enormously strong hand — 
plenty of food, water and energy; peaceful neighbors; and what remains the most prosperous and 
dynamic economy the world has ever seen, with 
a per person GDP of over $80,000 a year. Most 
important, our nation is blessed with the benefit of 
true freedom and liberty. See the sidebar on the 
amazing power of freedom later in this section. 
While we may always have a complex relationship 
with China (made all the more complicated and 
serious by ongoing wars), the country’s vast size 
and importance to so many other nations requires 
us to stay engaged — thoughtfully and without 
fear. At the same time, we need to build and execute our own long-term, comprehensive economic 
security strategy to keep our position safe and 
secure. I believe that respectful, strong and consistent engagement would be best for both our countries and the rest of the world. 
We need to strengthen and rebuild the 
international order — we may need a new 
Bretton Woods.
The international rules-based order established by 
the Western world after World War II is clearly 
under attack by outside forces, somewhat weakened by its own failures and inability to keep up 
with the increasingly complex world. This international order relies on a web of military alliances, 
trade agreements (e.g., World Trade Organization), 
development finance (e.g., International Monetary 
Fund and the World Bank) and related global tax 
and investment policies and diplomacy organizations (e.g., United Nations), which have evolved 
into a confusing and overlapping regime of policies. You can now add to it the new issues of cyber 
warfare, digital trade and privacy, and global 
taxes, among others. 

A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR AMERICA AND THE FREE WESTERN WORLD: STRATEGY AND POLICY MATTER 

It might be a good idea to convene a group of likeminded leaders to build and improve upon what 
already exists. The time may be right for a reimagined Bretton Woods — and by this, I mean revitalizing our global architecture. Since too many parts 
of the world have been neglected, any new system 
has to take into account and properly address the 
needs of all nations, including areas of concentrated poverty.
While we hope the wars in Ukraine and in the 
Middle East will end eventually (and, we hope, successfully from the standpoint of our allies), these 
other critical economic battles could possibly continue throughout our lifetime. If the Western world 
is slowly split apart over the next few decades, it 
will likely be the result of our failure to effectively 
address crucial global economic challenges.
PROVIDING STRONG LEADERSHIP 
GLOBALLY AND EFFECTIVE 
POLICYMAKING DOMESTICALLY
When you travel around the United States and talk 
with people of all types and persuasions, there is a 
rather common refrain; namely, why are we helping foreign nations with the safety of their borders 
and economies when we are not doing a particularly good job of protecting our own? While there is 
no moral equivalency in these arguments, they are 
understandable. It is clear that many Americans 
feel we need to do a better job here at home 
before we can focus over there. We can understand why some people living in this country, who 
have been neglected for decades, ask how their 
government can find the money for Ukraine and 
other parts of the world but not for them. It is a 
reasonable question.
From my point of view, our highly charged, emotional and political domestic issues are centered 
around 1) immigration and lack of border security 
and 2) the fraying of the American dream, particularly for low-income and rural Americans who feel 
left behind amid the growing wealth and prosperity of others around them. Please read the sidebar 
on page 57, which I believe explains the legitimate 
frustration of some of our citizens. And I agree 
with them. 
In the sidebar, I also explain how two policies (a 
large expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit 
and focus on work skills and job outcomes at high 
schools, community colleges and colleges) would 
not only dramatically increase both the income 
and employment opportunities for many of those 
left behind but would also have the virtue of actually growing the workforce. The combined effect of 
all of this would be quite a boon to our GDP. 
I believe that many affected Americans are not 
angry at hardworking, law-abiding immigrants 
and, in fact, acknowledge the critical role immigrants continue to play in building this wonderful 
country. Rather, they are angry that America has 
not implemented proper border control and immigration policies. It is astounding that many in 
Congress know what to do and want to do it but 
are simply unable to pass legislation because of 
partisan politics. Congress did come close on a 
few occasions — and I hope they keep trying.
Deliberate policies meant to drive healthy 
growth are needed.
For over two decades, since 2000, America has 
grown at an anemic rate of 2%. We should have 
strived for and achieved 3% growth. Had we done 
so, GDP per person today would be $16,000 
higher, which would, in turn, have paid for better 
healthcare, childcare, education and other 
services. Importantly, the best way to handle 
our excess deficit and debt issues is to maximize 
economic growth.
Growth policies include (the list could be very 
long so I’ll just mention a few):
• Consistent tax policies, conducive to both 
employment and capital investment. Capital 
investment is the primary driver of innovation, 
productivity and, therefore, growth in America. 
Tax policies change too frequently, which causes 
uncertainty and complicates long-term capital 
investment decision making (I won’t bore you 
with the details here). A bipartisan committee of 
Congress is probably required to fix this — and 
the sooner the better. 

A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR AMERICA AND THE FREE WESTERN WORLD: STRATEGY AND POLICY MATTER

• Well-conceived regulations (and related 
laws). This requires an ongoing concerted 
effort to streamline regulations to cost effectively drive better outcomes for the United 
States. The last thing we need is a constant 
pile-on of politically driven, fragmented policies. Please read the sidebar on the next 
page, an editorial in The Wall Street Journal by 
George McGovern, one of the most liberal 
presidential nominees in our lifetime, in which 
he clearly lays out the complexity, risks and 
costs that businesses, large and small, face 
every day. While he acknowledges the worthiness of the goals of many regulations, he 
points out their negatives. He also calls out 
the “blame-shifting and scapegoating” and 
“the endless exposure to frivolous claims and 
high legal fees.” Not only is this state of 
affairs demoralizing, but it also reduces 
employment, capital investment and the formation of new businesses, as well as cause 
unnecessary bankruptcies. Estimates of the 
regulatory costs for America are approximately $19,000 per worker, dwarfing the regulatory burdens in other countries. We all 
want sensible regulations that make us a better and safer nation — but this number is 
astounding. We should be able to accomplish 
our goals while sharply reducing needless and 
wasteful expenses. And remember, it’s discouraging not only to companies but to all citizens who have to deal with it on a daily basis. 
• Timely permits on projects large and small. 
There is virtually no industry — from agriculture and construction to transportation, technology, and oil and gas — or business, large or 
small, that isn’t disadvantaged by the tedious 
process and the length of time it takes to get 
approvals for permits to get things done. This 
includes federal, state and local requirements. 
These bottlenecks also make investment far 
more costly and slow. Timely permits would 
improve infrastructure and save lives, not 
endanger them.
• Proper federal government budgeting and 
fiscal management. The staggering inability 
of the government to draft and pass a proper 
budget causes deep and unnecessary damage 
to our growth. Some people estimate that the 
waste alone (due to improper payments, overlapping programs, and fragmented and duplicative contracts, among other things) could cost 
the nation hundreds of billions of dollars annually. This uncertainty filters through virtually 
every part of the American economy and should 
not be accepted. 
We can all forgo a little self-interest to do what 
is right for our country.
Those of us who have benefited the most from this 
country bear even greater responsibility to do this. 
It’s perfectly understandable that institutions, 
including businesses, unions and industries, lobby 
in Washington, D.C., to protect themselves — in 
good ways and bad — but we should more regularly put national interests ahead of self-interests. 
It’s good to want to ensure well-paying jobs and 
healthy industries. But it is not good when it 
reduces competition, stops the deployment of 
enhanced technology, harms efficiency, creates 
fake jobs or builds bridges to nowhere or damages 
the general health of the economy. Doing the right 
thing, the right way — which is achievable — would 
be better for everyone. As former President John 
F. Kennedy said, “Ask not what your country can do 
for you — ask what you can do for your country.”
Celebrate American exceptionalism.
We can safely say that America is an exceptional 
nation built and grounded on principles — principles of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, 
free enterprise (capitalism), and the freedom and 
empowerment brought to us by our democracy 
through the power to elect our leaders and of our 
Constitution, which makes these individual freedoms sacrosanct. Much of the world yearns to be 
here because of those principles — the right to life, 
liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We should 
extol those virtues while recognizing that America 
has never been a perfect nation, like all other 
nations. We can acknowledge our flaws and strive 
to constantly correct them, without denigrating 
our nation.

Manager's Journal: 
A Politician's Dream ls a Businessman's Nightmare 
By George McGovern 
Wisdom too often never comes, 
and so one ought not to reject it merely 
because it comes late. 
-- Justice Felix Frankfurter 
It's been 11 years since I left the 
U.S. Senate, after serving 24 years in 
high public office. After leaving a 
career in politics, I devoted much of my 
time to public lectures that took me into 
every state in the union and much of 
Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Latin 
America. 
In 1988, I invested most of the 
earnings from this lecture circuit 
acquiring the leasehold on Connecticut's 
Stratford Inn. Hotels, inns and 
restaurants have always held a special 
fascination for me. The Stratford Inn 
promised the realization of a longtime 
dream to own a combination hotel, 
restaurant and public conference 
facility -- complete with an experienced 
manager and staff. 
In retrospect, I wish I had known 
more about the hazards and difficulties 
of such a business, especially during a 
recession of the kind that hit New 
England just as I was acquiring the 
inn's 43-year leasehold. I also wish 
that during the years I was in public 
office, I had had this firsthand 
experience about the difficulties 
business people face every day. That 
knowledge would have made me a 
better U.S. senator and a more 
understanding presidential contender. 
Today we are much closer to a 
general acknowledgment that 
government must encourage business to 
expand and grow. Bill Clinton, Paul 
Tsongas, Bob Kerrey and others have, I 
believe, changed the debate of our 
party. We intuitively know that to 
create job opportunities we need 
entrepreneurs who will risk their capital 
against an expected payoff. Too often, 
however, public policy does not consider 
whether we are choking off those 
opportunities. 
 My own business perspective has been limited to that small hotel and restaurant in Stratford, Conn., with an especially difficult lease and a severe recession. But my business associates and I also lived with federal, state and local rules that were all passed with the objective of helping employees, protecting the environment, raising tax dollars for schools, protecting our customers from fire hazards, etc. While I never have doubted the worthiness of any of these goals, the concept that most often eludes legislators is: "Can we make consumers pay the higher prices for the increased operating costs that accompany public regulation and government reporting requirements with reams of red tape." It is a simple concern that is nonetheless often ignored by legislators.

It is a simple concern that is nonetheless often ignored by legislators. 
For example, the papers today 
are filled with stories about businesses 
dropping health coverage for 
employees. We provided a substantial 
package for our staff at the Stratford 
Inn. However, were we operating today, 
those costs would exceed $150,000 a year 
for health care on top of salaries and 
other benefits. There would have been 
no reasonable way for us to absorb or 
pass on these costs. 
Some of the escalation in the 
cost of health care is attributed to 
patients suing doctors. While one 
cannot assess the merit of all these 
claims, I've also witnessed firsthand the 
explosion in blame-shifting and 
scapegoating for every negative 
experience in life. 
Today, despite bankruptcy, we 
are still dealing with litigation from 
individuals who fell in or near our 
restaurant. Despite these injuries, not 
cause. But that reason masks the 
variety of other challenges we faced 
that drive operating costs and financing 
charges beyond what a small business 
can handle. 
It is clear that some businesses 
have products that can be priced at 
almost any level. The price of raw 
materials (e.g., steel and glass) and 
life-saving drugs and medical care 
are not easily substituted by consumers. 
It is only competition or antitrust that 
tempers price increases. Consumers 
may delay purchases, but they have 
little choice when faced with higher 
prices. 
In services, however, consumers 
do have a choice when faced with 
higher prices. You may have to stay in 
a hotel while on vacation, but you can 
stay fewer days. You can eat in 
restaurants fewer times per month, or 
forgo a number of services from car 
washes to shoeshines. Every such 
decision eventually results in job losses 
for someone. And often these are the 
people without the skills to help 
themselves -· the people I've spent a 
lifetime trying to help. 
In short, "one-size-fits-all" 
rules for business ignore the reality of 
the marketplace. And setting thresholds 
for regulatory guidelines at artificial 
levels -- e.g., 50 employees or more, 
$500,000 in sales -- takes no account of 
other realities, such as profit margins, 
labor intensive vs. capital intensive 
businesses, and local market 
economics. 
The problem we face as 
legislators is: Where do we set the bar 
so that it is not too high to clear? I don't 
have the answer. I do know that we

viewed as a lawsuit instead of an 
unfortunate accident. And while the 
business owner may prevail in the end, 
the endless exposure to frivolous claims 
and high legal fees is frightening.

[) I DOW JONES 

Let’s celebrate the shared sense of sacrifice 
that gives us all strength. 
There were very few positives from the pandemic, 
but I’m mentioning one, which, unfortunately, 
didn’t last, but reflected the best of us. In New 
York City, at 7 p.m. every evening, people throughout the city would open their windows, shouting 
and screaming and banging pots and pans to show 
gratitude to the essential workers — sanitation 
workers, police, firefighters, emergency responders, nurses and doctors. Of course, these workers 
were always essential, but I was hoping that spirit 
and civility would become deeply embedded and 
have longer lasting effects in our society. 
I can understand when an individual for conscientious reasons chooses not to do work that helps 
our military. But I cannot understand when an 
entire company takes that position. How can we 
have a sense of shared sacrifice, when America is 
home to 18 million veterans who were willing to 
risk their lives for America’s safety, and yet some 
companies are not even willing to use their fingertips to help? 
For example, back in 1969 the cancellation of 
the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps programs by 
the country’s most prestigious universities and 
colleges likely fueled the great divide — between 
elites and others in our country — that persists 
today. Our strength as a nation is best served 
when the best students and the best soldiers are 
brought together, and we would all benefit from 
more civility and better teaching around basic 
virtues like hard work, shared sacrifice, justice, 
rationality and more respect for the enduring 
values of American freedom and free enterprise. 
Resist being “weaponized.”
We can start by trying to understand other people’s 
and other voters’ points of view, even around deeply 
emotional topics. We can stop insulting whole 
classes of voters. We can stop name calling. We can 
stop blame-shifting and scapegoating. We can stop 
being petty. Politicians can cease insulting, baiting 
and belittling each other, which diminishes them 
and the voter. It has also become too acceptable 
for some politicians to say one thing in private and 
deliver a completely different message in public. 
It would also be nice to see some cabinet members 
from the opposing party. We should also stop 
degrading and demonizing American business 
and American institutions, which are the best in 
the world, because it erodes confidence in our 
very country. 
Social media could do more. 
There is no question that social media has some 
real negative effects, from the manipulation of 
elections to the increasingly documented negative 
effects on the mental health of children. These are 
issues impacting our individual and collective 
spheres, and it’s time for social media companies 
to take more action to remedy these challenges — 
and swiftly. Rapid advances in technology will not 
only make these existing issues harder to address, 
but they will likely create new ones. The current 
state of the online information landscape has 
wide-ranging implications on trust in institutions, 
information integrity and more — and it bears on 
institutions like ours, where platform policy has 
increasingly widespread implications for concerns 
about fraud, security and other issue spaces.
A range of tools and approaches is required to 
address this complex and important situation — 
and there are several measures that platform companies can immediately enact, voluntarily, while 
strengthening and improving their business models. 
One commonsense and modest step would be for 
social media companies to further empower platform users’ control over what they see and how it 
is presented, leveraging existing tools and features 
— like the alternative feed algorithm settings some 
offer today. I believe many users (not just parents) 
would appreciate a greater ability to more carefully curate their feeds; for example, prioritizing 
educational content for their children.
Platforms could also consider enhanced authentication measures; i.e., having users identify themselves to the platform or to a trusted third party. 
This would have the virtue of increasing individual 
accountability and reducing imposters, bots and 

A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR AMERICA AND THE FREE WESTERN WORLD: STRATEGY AND POLICY MATTER 

possibly foreign political actors on platforms. It 
would have immediate benefits for users who prefer content from authenticated sources that take 
responsibility for their postings. There are clear 
competing values that need to be balanced in such 
an approach, including those related to our cherished right to free speech, individual privacy and 
inclusion (for example, roughly 850 million people 
globally don’t have a way to easily authenticate 
themselves today). There are also legitimate questions as to whether authentication would be used 
as a tool to chill or block speech or quash bona 
fide political dissenters, and real work needs to be 
done to identify policy and technical solutions that 
balance such risks and benefits. 
I offer these approaches as a starting place, understanding that it’s crucial to continue honest conversation across sectors about the immediate, 
incremental improvements we can make to our 
online public square, considering the high stakes 
involved in how information is created and shared.
Effective measures will require time, money, learning and improvement, all in service of significantly 
enhancing the well-being, quality, and civility of 
our experiences online and in the world around us.
Healthy collaboration with business is needed. 
Companies big and small create jobs, pay for 
employee healthcare and benefits, and build 
bridges, roads and hospitals. The people who work 
for and run these companies care deeply about 
their country — they are patriots, and they want to 
see people and communities succeed and prosper. 
Unfortunately, the message America hears is that 
the federal government does not value business — 
that business is the problem and not part of the 
solution. There are fewer individuals in government who have any significant experience in starting or running a company, which is apparent every 
day in the political rhetoric that demonizes businesses and free enterprise and that damages confidence in American’s institutions. The relationship 
between business and government, in fact, might 
improve if there were more people from the business sector working in government. Inexperience 
with business is also evident from the regular lack 
of transparency or curiosity from regulators as 
they develop economic policies with potentially 
seismic consequences for the economy.
When I travel around the country, I experience a 
very different perspective on the street and at the 
local level — I see that many governors, mayors 
and city council members understand they are not 
facing big challenges alone. They stand shoulder to 
shoulder with our company, even when some of 
their constituents disagree or are skeptical about 
big banks. These government officials know they 
need partners who have the same stake in helping 
successful communities thrive and who care about 
building a prosperous future as much as they do. 
For example, in fewer than 10 years, Detroit saw 
one of the greatest turnarounds because of a 
vibrant collaboration between government and 
business. And businesses know they cannot succeed if individuals, families, towns and cities are 
not flourishing. We obviously don’t agree on everything, but there is a shared belief that we must 
work together. We can and should be full partners 
in developing solutions to our big problems.
The federal government, regardless of which 
party is in charge, needs to earn back trust 
through competence and effective 
policymaking. 
The world is becoming more complex, more technologically competent and faster. Unfortunately, 
the government simply is not built to innovate, 
compete and move quickly, as in the competitive 
business world. This may be the reason why government is becoming less effective. We need to 
take action on this because the loss of trust in 
government is damaging to society. We should be 
brutally honest about the staggering number of 
policies, systems and operations that are underperforming: Too many ineffective public schools do 
not give students the skills they need to land a 
well-paying job; we have over 25 million uninsured 
Americans, soaring healthcare costs and too many 
bad outcomes; we are unable to plan, permit and 
build infrastructure efficiently; our litigation 

A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR AMERICA AND THE FREE WESTERN WORLD: STRATEGY AND POLICY MATTER

system is capricious and wasteful; progress on 
immigration policies and reform is frustrating; lack 
of efficient mortgage markets and an affordable 
housing policy keep housing out of reach for many 
Americans; problems plague the Department of 
Veterans Affairs, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Internal Revenue Service; public universities don’t take responsibility for their costs 
and are often funded by excessive student lending; 
underinvestment in the electric grid results in 
high costs and unreliable service; highly inefficient 
U.S. merchant shipping and ports; and we have 
unfunded pension plans and no action on deficit 
spending, Social Security and Medicare. I’ll stop 
here. This should be unacceptable to all of us. 
We need to find a way to bring more varied 
expertise and accountability to government. 
We should be more ambitious in striving for excellence in government. I acknowledge that some of 
the best and the brightest are in government and 
the military today. Yet we should return to a government that seeks out more of the best and the 
brightest people from every background, including 
the private sector, to benefit from their knowledge 
and experience. Government also needs to leverage 
the expertise of business to address problems that 
it cannot solve on its own. And to be fair, business 
could use its influence to do less to further its own 
interest and more to enhance the nation as a whole. 
We need good government. And there are some 
things only governments can do, such as oversee 
the military and justice systems. And while most 
innovation happens through the private sector, 
there are certain types of foundational innovations 
that can only be advanced by the government, 
such as basic research that simply cannot be 
funded by business. The Democrats want the 
government to do even more and the Republicans 
even less — I think we should spend more time 
trying to do even better. But no one, not even my 
most liberal Democratic friends, thinks that sending the government another trillion a year would 
be a wise use of money. 
OUT OF THE LABYRINTH, WITH FOCUS 
AND RESOLVE 
Even America, the most prosperous nation on the 
planet with its vast resources, needs to focus its 
resources on the complex and difficult tasks ahead. 
I hope to never read a book about How the West 
Was Lost, summarized as follows: The failure to 
save Ukraine and find peace in the Middle East led 
to more bickering among the allies and weakened 
military alliances. This accelerated a division 
within the Western world, splitting countries into 
different economic spheres and with each nation 
trying to protect its economy, trade and energy 
sources. America’s economy weakened, eventually 
leading to the loss of its reserve currency status. 
Besotted by populism and partisanship and 
crippled by bureaucracy and lack of willpower, 
America failed to focus on what it needed to do 
to lead and save the Western world. The enemy 
was within — we just didn’t see it in time. 
Paraphrasing what Winston Churchill was thought 
to have said: America, after it had exhausted all 
other possibilities, would do the right thing. 
What I want and hope to see is a book about 
How the West Was Won. As the wars in Ukraine 
and the Middle East dragged on and as the fears of 
the Western world mounted, America rose to the 
challenge as it had in other turbulent times in 
history. America coalesced with its allies to form 
the alliances necessary to keep the world safe for 
freedom and democracy. 
I remain with a deep and abiding faith in the 
strength of the enduring values of America.

A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR AMERICA AND THE FREE WESTERN WORLD: STRATEGY AND POLICY MATTER 

WE SHOULD HAVE MORE FAITH IN THE AMAZING POWER 
OF OUR FREEDOMS 
The heart and soul of the dynamism of America is human 
freedom — freedom of speech, freedom of religion, free 
enterprise (capitalism), and the freedom and empowerment 
brought to us by our democracy through the right to elect our 
leaders. Free people are at liberty to move around as they see 
fit, work as they see fit, dream as they see fit, and invest in 
themselves and in the pursuit of happiness as they see fit. This 
freedom that people enjoy, accompanied by the freedom of 
capital, is what drives the dynamism — economic and social — 
of this great country. 
Our civil liberties depend upon the rule of law, property rights, 
including intellectual property, and restrictions on government 
encroachment upon these freedoms. Our Constitution and Bill 
of Rights secure our individual freedoms and reserve all rights 
to the individual other than those important but limited 
authorities given to the government.
The issue of individual rights is not all or none or freedom versus no freedom. There are, of course, terrible examples where 
individual rights were trampled upon, and the results were devastating — both for the individual and for the economy — in East 
Germany, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Venezuela, to name a few. 
And there are many countries that protect individual rights and 
are on a spectrum closer to American values. Think of Europe, 
for example. But even in some countries that have some of 
these rights, a lack of dynamism — often due to bureaucracy, 
weak institutions and government, and corruption — is palpable 
and has clearly led to less innovation, lower growth and, in 
general, a lower standard of living.
Freedom must necessarily be joined with the principle of 
striving toward equal opportunity. Equal opportunity is what 
allows individuals to rise to the best of their ability — it also 
means unequal outcomes. Equal opportunity is the foundation 
for fairness and meritocracy. The fight for equality, which is a 
good moral goal, should not damage the rights of the individual 
and their liberties. 
Democracy and freedom are cojoined — together, they make 
freedom more durable. Democracy also has a self-correcting 
element — every four years you get to throw out leadership if 
you don’t like them (which you do not see in autocracies). But 
we all know that democracy can be sloppy: Maintaining an 
effective democracy is hard work. Democracy fosters open 
debate and compromise, which lead to better decisions over 
time (whether in government or in business). Intelligence is 
effectively “crowdsourced” with constant feedback. Good public 
policy comes from good debate and analytics, guided by reason 
coupled with a firm understanding of what you would like the 
outcomes to be and complemented with an honest assessment 
of what is really happening.
Even democracies can become stagnant, bureaucratic and selfperpetuating. Good government does many admirable things, 
but admitting to mistakes is often not one of them. It takes 
civically engaged citizens and a strong free press to bring 
sunlight to issues and keep a nation strong. 
Autocratic societies by their nature subjugate the individual to 
the state. By definition they are not meritocracies — they are 
more about “who you know,” and they exist to perpetuate the 
existing ruling class. Their decisions are based on a completely 
different calculation, and their decision-making process does 
not encourage and, therefore, benefit from open 
debate.?Democracy means that it is immoral to subjugate 
individual freedoms to state actors other than to protect the 
existence of the nation itself.
There are values that many of us hold dear, such as religion, 
family and country. But none may be more important than the 
freedoms that allow us to choose to live our life as we see fit. 
We should do more to applaud the virtue and amazing power of 
our freedoms. 

A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR AMERICA AND THE FREE WESTERN WORLD: STRATEGY AND POLICY MATTER

HOW WE CAN HELP LIFT UP OUR LOW-INCOME CITIZENS 
AND MEND AMERICA’S TORN SOCIAL FABRIC 
To fix problems, we must first acknowledge them. Despite 
decades of government programs and all the moralizing that 
surrounds them, we have not done a particularly good job 
lifting up our low-income fellow citizens. I may be wrong, but I 
do believe this is tearing at the social fabric of America and is 
among the root causes of the fraying of the American dream.
The gap between low-wage and well-paid workers has been 
growing dramatically. From 1979 to 2019, the wage growth of 
the top 10% was nearly 10 times that of the bottom 10% — 
which, basically, had not increased at all. The growth of lowincome workers’ annualized real wages after the pandemic 
was, for the first time in decades, higher than the top 60%, but 
that’s not enough. The net worth for the bottom 25% of 
households is $20,800, and the net worth for the bottom 10% 
is essentially $0. This makes it increasingly difficult for lowwage workers to support their families. Of the 160 million 
Americans working today, approximately 40 million are paid 
less than $15 per hour.
Low-income individuals bear far greater burdens than the rest 
of us. Nearly 40% of Americans don’t have $400 in savings to 
deal with unexpected expenses, such as medical bills or car 
repairs, which leads to financial distress. More than 25 million 
Americans don’t have medical insurance at all; of these, one in 
five are in a family with income below the federal poverty level. 
People who live in low-income neighborhoods also tend to have 
worse health outcomes, including higher rates of mental health 
issues, depression and suicide, and a lower life expectancy — as 
many as 20 years. Finally, low-income Americans generally 
experience higher unemployment and more crime. 
No one can claim that the promise of equal opportunity is being 
offered to all Americans through our education systems. 
Students in the lowest socioeconomic bracket are 50% less 
likely to attend college than those in the highest socioeconomic 
groups. Many inner city schools graduate under 50% of their 
students — and even those who graduate may not be wellprepared for the workforce. In addition, boys growing up in the 
bottom 10% of family income are 20 times more likely to be 
incarcerated. Those who do run afoul of our justice system 
generally do not get the second chance that many of them 
deserve. Their exclusion from the workforce is not only unfair 
to them but also results in an estimated $87 billion average 
annual cost to the economy. 
Too many policies that are wrong — affecting housing and 
mortgage markets, healthcare, immigration, regulation, 
education and student lending, to name a few — are 
jeopardizing the opportunity for American citizens to succeed. 
The people who suffer the most, throughout all of this, are not 
high-income individuals. I strongly believe that these outcomes 
are destroying the concept of “fair” in America and are driving 
populism and diminishing, if not eliminating, trust — not only in 
government but in all our institutions. Simply put, the social 
needs of far too many of our citizens are not being met. We 
should never accept these outcomes — we must fix them. 
There are two policy changes that I believe can have a dramatic 
effect on jobs, growth and equality — and they go a long way 
toward repairing the frayed American dream. Let’s start by 
treating all jobs with respect. Even starter jobs, which are the 
first rung on the ladder of opportunity, bring dignity and create 
better social outcomes in terms of health, higher household 
formation and lower crime. Of these two policy changes, one 
would better utilize existing resources, and the other would 
cost some money. But both would significantly change 
outcomes for low-income Americans. 
The free one is so blindingly obvious that it’s almost 
embarrassing to propose. Our schools (high schools, 
community colleges and perhaps even four-year colleges) 
should take responsibility for outcomes — they should be 
judged on the quality and income level of the jobs that their 
graduates and even non-graduates attain. This means providing 
graduating students and other individuals with work skills (in 
fields such as advanced manufacturing, cyber, data science and 
technology, healthcare and so on) that will lead to better paying 
jobs. These schools should work with local businesses to 
replicate effective programs that are in place — because that is 
where the actual jobs are now. This would be good for growth 
and, as there are so many examples of successful programs, we 

A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR AMERICA AND THE FREE WESTERN WORLD: STRATEGY AND POLICY MATTER 

already know what to do. With nearly 9 million job openings 
and just under 6 million unemployed workers in the United 
States, job skills training has never been needed more. We 
already spend a tremendous amount of money on education — 
just not the right way.
The second step is related to the first: Get more income to lowpaid workers. While this one would cost money, it is to me a 
complete no-brainer since it is an expansion of an existing 
program, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which many 
Democrats and Republicans already agree upon. Today, the 
EITC supplements low- to moderate-income working individuals 
and couples, particularly with children and people living in rural 
areas. For example, a single mother with two children earning 
$9 an hour (approximately $20,000 a year) could receive a tax 
credit of more than $6,000 at year-end. Workers without 
children receive a very small tax credit (96% of all EITC dollars 
were received by families with children). This should be 
dramatically expanded, including eliminating the child 
requirement from the calculation altogether. We should convert 
the EITC to make it more like a negative income payroll tax, 
paid monthly. Any tax credit income should not be offset by any 
other benefits these individuals already receive (we have to 
eliminate benefit “cliffs” that disincentivize work). 
An increase in the EITC to a maximum of $10,000 would cost 
tens of billions a year, but I have little doubt that these policy 
changes would do more than anything else to lift up lowincome families and their communities. Well-paying jobs have 
been shown to reduce crime, increase household formation, 
improve health and reduce addiction. Both of these policies 
would have the virtue of increasing the number of people in the 
workforce. I also have little doubt that this would add to GDP. 
We should attack all our other problems as well, but these two 
policy changes alone would dramatically improve our lowincome neighborhoods, broadly strengthen the economy and 
give more opportunity to deserving citizens. It would restore 
the American Dream for many.?

In Closing
It’s been 20 years since the Bank One-JPMorgan Chase merger — and it’s been 
an extraordinary journey. I can’t even begin to express my heartfelt appreciation 
and respect for the tremendous character and capabilities of the 
management team who got us through the good times and the bad times 
to where we stand today. And I recognize that we all stand on the shoulders of many 
others who came before us in building this exceptional company of ours. 
I would also like to express my deep gratitude to the 300,000+ employees, 
and their families, of JPMorgan Chase. Through these annual letters, 
I hope shareholders and all readers have gained a deeper understanding 
of what it takes to be an “endgame winner” in a rapidly changing world. 
More important, I hope you are as proud of what we have achieved — as a business, 
as a bank and as a community investor — as I am. 
Thank you for your partnership.
Finally, we sincerely hope to see the world on the path to peace and prosperity.

rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced from the fund rating providers. Quartile rankings are 
based on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage 
of AUM is based on fund performance and associated peer rankings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, at a “primary share class” level to 
represent the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong SAR funds and at the fund level for all other funds. The performance data may have been 
different if all share classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results. “Primary share class” means the C share class for European 
funds and Acc share class for Hong Kong SAR and Taiwan funds. If these share classes are not available, the oldest share class is used as the primary share 
class. Due to a methodology change effective September 30, 2023, prior results include all long-term mutual fund assets and exclude active ETF assets.

34 Percentage of active mutual fund and active ETF assets under management in funds rated 4- or 5-star: Mutual fund rating services rank funds based on their 
risk adjusted performance over various periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star rating 
represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the 
next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of industrywide ranked funds. An overall 
Morningstar rating is derived from a weighted average of the performance associated with a fund’s three-, five and ten- year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating 
metrics. For U.S.- domiciled funds, separate star ratings are provided at the individual share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on three-year 
risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of history are not rated and hence excluded from these rankings. All ratings, the assigned 
peer categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced from the applicable fund rating provider. Where applicable, the fund rating 
providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a 
“primary share class” level to represent the star rating of all other funds, except for Japan, for which Nomura provides ratings at the fund level. The 
performance data may have been different if all share classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results.

CONSUMER & COMMUNITY BANKING

• Delivering financial performance that is 
consistently best-in-class.
• Leveraging data and technology to 
deliver customer value and drive speed 
to market.
• Protecting our customers and the firm 
through a strong risk and controls 
environment.
• Cultivating talent to build highperforming, diverse teams where 
culture is a competitive advantage.
Our strategy is working as evidenced by 
our results last year.
GROWING AND DEEPENING 
RELATIONSHIPS 
After the pandemic, we accelerated the 
pace of customer acquisition while lowering attrition. Maintaining that momentum, 
we now serve over 82 million consumers 
and 6.4 million small businesses, up 11% 
and 37%, respectively, since 2019. We’re 
driving that growth across businesses — 
during the same period, Consumer Banking customers are up 18%, Business 
Banking clients are up 41% and Card 
accounts are up 30%1.
We’re engaging customers with our products and services and delivering seamless 
experiences across digital and branch 
channels. Our digital banking platform 
grew to nearly 67 million active customers, up 28% since 2019. Once customers 
begin to use Chase.com and the Chase 
mobile app, we make it easy to help them 
save for the future, make small or big 
purchases (including a car or home), plan 
for retirement or a dream vacation, or 
find the perfect restaurant for a night 
on the town. 
Our branches remain a critical touchpoint 
as over 900,000 people walk into one 
every day. We know being local matters 
and that customers increasingly value 
personal interaction and advice. In 2023, 
over 2 million more customers met with 
a banker than in 2022. 
Once we onboard a customer to the franchise, we focus on earning the right to 
deepen that relationship and serve more 
of their financial needs. Last year was a 
banner year for deepening as we ended 
2023 with over 24 million multi-line of 
business (LOB) customers — up 9% from 
2022 and 30% from 20193. We have 
prioritized growing multi-LOB relationships as it helps us address more of our 
customers’ needs while driving higher 
retention and engagement with our products and services. We constantly focus 
on improving the customer experience, 
which we measure in many ways. We’re 
proud to have all-time-high satisfaction 
I’m very proud to have co-led Consumer 
& Community Banking (CCB) for the past 
three years and am grateful to Jenn 
Piepszak for her partnership. When we 
took over this leading franchise, we 
established a strategic framework for 
continued, long-term success, and that 
framework guided CCB to deliver strong 
performance again in 2023. The evolving 
macro landscape means uncertainty on 
many fronts: the financial health of the 
consumer, the path of credit and interest 
rates, and the impact of new regulations. 
While the future will bring challenges, it 
will also create opportunities, and we’ve 
proved our ability to adapt and optimize.
In 2023, we remained focused on a 
consistent set of strategic priorities:
• Growing and deepening relationships by:
— Engaging customers with products 
and services they love and
— Expanding our distribution

ratings across branch and digital channels, while our complaint rate per 
account is down nearly 10% year-overyear. Customer attrition is below historic 
levels, and CCB’s overall net promoter 
score remains very healthy. 
DELIVERING FINANCIAL 
PERFORMANCE THAT IS 
CONSISTENTLY BEST-IN-CLASS
While we recognize that favorable macro 
conditions contributed to overearning in 
net interest income and credit, we still outperformed as we delivered strong returns 
and grew market share across businesses. 
With a 38% return on equity, we exceeded 
our 25% target for the third straight year 
and would have done so even when normalized to reflect through-the-cycle credit 
and rate assumptions. Net income was 
$21.2 billion, up 42% over 2022. Revenue 
of $70.1 billion was up 28% from 2022, and 
CCB’s overhead ratio was 50%. Average 
deposits were $1.1 trillion, and although 
down 3% from 2022, we outperformed the 
industry average. Average loans were up 
20% over the prior year to $526 billion, 
including the First Republic acquisition.
EXTENDING OUR #1 POSITION 
ACROSS INDUSTRY-LEADING 
BUSINESSES
Our momentum is driven by successful 
execution across all lines of business 
in CCB. We’re the clear market leader in 
Consumer Banking, Business Banking 
and Card and continue to grow. 
Consumer Banking 
We extended our #1 position in 2023 with 
an 11.3% deposit market share, up 40 
basis points from 2022. Excluding First 
Republic, share growth was up 10 basis 
points. Since 2019, we’ve increased our 
share by 220 basis points. We’ll continue 
to drive growth by expanding branches 
and evolving products to meet customer 
needs by segment. 
Branches remain the hub for our local 
team of experts — over 50,000 bankers, 
advisors and business relationship 
managers — and a key distribution channel 
for all parts of the firm. We continue to 
optimize our network of over 4,800 
branches as we aim to be within a 
10-minute drive for 70% of the U.S. 
population. This will help us grow share 
in major metropolitan areas like Boston, 
Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., as 
well as states with mostly rural populations such as Alabama and Iowa, where 
we are also expanding our presence. 
We’ve added more than 650 new 
branches in the last five years, by far 
the most of any bank in the U.S. We’re 
doubling down on that investment and 
will add 500+ branches over the next 
three years. The result is a significantly 
younger branch network, which creates 
embedded growth that already has driven 
share gains and will continue to do so for 
years to come. Newer or “unseasoned” 
branches represent more than $150 billion in incremental deposit upside as they 
mature. At the same time, we are consolidating older branches in certain markets 
in response to shifting customer behavior.
We aim to be the bank for all, so tailoring 
products, services and experiences for 
each customer segment and community is 
central to our strategy. We’re increasingly 
focused on supporting the financial health 
of customers and communities through 
digital and in-person resources, such as 
our nearly 150 dedicated Community 
Managers. We now have 16 Community 
Center branches and plan to open three 
more in 2024.
We started 2023 with a goal of maintaining primary bank relationships and capturing money in motion, and we did both. 
We retained over 95% of our primary 
bank customers and succeeded in deepening with investments and an enhanced, 
higher-yield product set — including 
competitive-rate CDs and the new 
J.P. Morgan Premium Deposit account. As 
a result, we successfully captured more 
than 80% of yield-seeking flows in 2023. 
Business Banking 
We offer small business owners a comprehensive product suite to help them start, 
run and grow their businesses. We’re #1 
in small business primary bank share 
with 9.5% of a fragmented market and 
plan to grow by:
• Increasing banker capacity to better 
cover large clients, which drives higher 
retention, cross-product deepening and 
client satisfaction. In 2023, we added 
more than 350 bankers against our 
target of 1,000 incremental bankers.
• Rolling out value-added services like 
payroll, broadening our payment acceptance suite with new offerings such as 
invoicing (currently in pilot) and launching Tap-to-Pay, which enables merchants to accept card payments on 
their mobile devices.
• Continuing to expand support for small 
business owners in underserved communities through special purpose credit 
programs, one-on-one mentoring and 
local events.
Card
In 2023, we extended our #1 position in 
credit card, with sales and outstandings 
market share up approximately 50 and 
30 basis points, respectively, compared 
with 20194. 
We drove growth by leveraging our 
marketing capabilities to get the right 
products in the right customers’ hands. 
In 2023, we invested nearly $7 billion in 
4 Card outstandings market share has been revised to 
reflect a restatement to the 2022 reported total industry

gross marketing to generate 10 million 
new credit card accounts and deliver 
benefits to existing cardholders. The 
continued demand for our leading products 
has fueled portfolio growth, enabling us 
to deliver more value and drive engagement with our customer base. 
In 2023, we focused on enhancing our 
Card product continuum to effectively 
serve the unique needs of each customer 
segment and: 
• Launched Chase Freedom RiseSM for 
younger, new-to-credit customers, 
which has shown strong adoption using 
our branches as its primary distribution.
• Launched DoorDash Rewards 
Mastercard®, adding a new strategic 
partner to our co-brand portfolio.
• Scaled Ink Business PremierSM, launched 
in late 2022, to grow share with small 
businesses.
• Continued to enhance the Sapphire 
value proposition by opening lounges in 
five airports to date and leveraging the 
travel, dining and shopping experiences 
we’re building in Connected Commerce.
SCALING GROWTH BUSINESSES 
In Connected Commerce and Wealth 
Management, we have the assets to win 
and outsized opportunity to grow to 
what we view is our fair share, given the 
breadth of CCB relationships. These businesses are natural adjacencies to banking 
and credit card, with scale and distribution that will fuel their growth.
Connected Commerce 
We continue building out a powerful twosided platform to connect Chase customers with top brands, helping them book 
travel, discover new dining experiences 
and save money while shopping. We 
expect to drive approximately $30 billion 
in volume and about $2 billion in revenue 
through the platform in 2025. We’ve 
nearly doubled volume over two years, 
driving more than $18 billion in 2023. 
Going forward, we’re focused on:
• Scaling Travel. We are a top 5 consumer 
leisure travel provider with $10 billion in 
booked volume last year, up more than 
25% from 2022. We’ve just relaunched 
ChaseTravel.com to help customers 
dream, discover and book travel, 
including a new collection of more than 
600 of the world’s finest hotels. 
• Expanding Shopping through Chase 
Offers. In 2023, we generated more 
than $8 billion in attributed spend 
volume, up over 30% from 2022. 
We’re accelerating growth by launching 
Chase Media SolutionsSM, a new digital 
media business aimed at merchants 
that allows them to target and connect 
with Chase customers.
• Innovating payments and lending 
capabilities. To provide customers with 
innovative, convenient ways to pay and 
borrow, last year we began to roll out 
Pay in 4SM, which has scaled to more 
than 20 million customers. We also saw 
more than 50% year-over-year growth 
in card-linked installment originations 
through My Chase Plan®.
Wealth Management 
In 2023, we grew client investment assets 
by 25% to $800 billion before accounting 
for the First Republic acquisition. In total, 
we ended the year with $950 billion in 
assets, up $450 billion since 2019, as we 
close in on our goal of reaching $1 trillion 
in assets under supervision. We now have 
2.5 million client relationships — up 60% 
from 2019 — with a record 120,000 firsttime investors in 2023.
This momentum stems from the investments we’ve made in products, channels 
and talent in the last four years since 
we established J.P. Morgan Wealth 
Management. In 2023, we:
• Added more than 400 total advisors, 
ending the year with nearly 5,500 on 
a path to 6,000. 
• Scaled Wealth Plan, an omnichannel 
financial planning experience that 
customers start digitally and can finish 
with an advisor. Customers have 
created more than 1 million financial 
plans since the experience launched 
in December 2022.

SECURED LENDING 
Auto and Home Lending
In Auto and Home Lending, our objective 
is not market share but to be there for customers during key moments and to create 
franchise value while continuing to maximize the strength of the firm’s balance 
sheet, capital and liquidity. Given the cyclical nature of both businesses, we manage 
returns on a through-the-cycle basis. 
Despite recent market headwinds, Auto 
and Home Lending delivered a return on 
equity of 17% and 15%, respectively, averaged over the last five years 6. While the 
acquisition of First Republic’s mortgage 
portfolio helped bolster Home Lending 
returns last year, CCB’s mortgage business 
was key to enabling the transaction. 
Across both businesses, we continue 
to leverage data and artificial intelligence 
(AI)-enabled techniques to enhance and 
optimize our underwriting and credit 
decisioning. 
We also remain committed to increasing 
homeownership among underserved 
communities. Our Chase Homebuyer 
Grant program has scaled to over 15,000 
communities since its launch in 2021, and 
we recently increased the grant amount 
to $7,500 in select markets.
LEVERAGING DATA AND 
TECHNOLOGY TO DELIVER 
CUSTOMER VALUE AND DRIVE 
SPEED TO MARKET
Data and technology make everything we 
do better — our products, channels and 
experiences. In 2023, CCB spent over 
$3 billion on technology investments 
spanning both product development and 
modernization. 
A little over half of our annual investment 
is focused on product development, helping ensure we have the best products, 
services and channels to meet customers’ 
evolving needs. From paying a bill and 
checking a balance to replacing a card 
and disputing a transaction, we’re making 
processes more seamless, taking friction 
out of customers’ everyday financial lives. 
At the same time, customers are increasingly engaging with our advice-oriented 
digital and omnichannel experiences to 
meet their more complex needs, like buying a home or planning for retirement. 
Engaged online activity — beyond viewing 
balances — is up 25% since 2019. 
The rest of our technology investment is 
focused on modernization, which is both 
offensive and defensive. We need to 
deliver new products and experiences 
more quickly while executing with resiliency at massive scale to stay competitive 
and avoid being disrupted. We’ve made 
significant progress and are on track to 
substantially complete data center migration by the end of 2024. We’ve also 
migrated almost 90% of our data to the 
public cloud. Looking ahead, we’ll continue to focus on modernizing our core 
banking infrastructure, which will enable 
us to launch products faster, improve 
platform stability and reduce run-thebank expenses over time.
Our data migration efforts help us take full 
advantage of our extraordinary data 
assets to deliver personalization at scale 
and accelerate existing and future AI initiatives. We’ve been using AI for years and 
have a strong foundation in place. Initially, 
we focused on using AI to drive cost reduction and risk avoidance, but we’ve pivoted 
to focus more on revenue growth. We’ll 
continue to invest where we will realize the 
greatest benefit, including:
• Optimizing marketing efforts to better 
target profitable prospects. 
• Identifying unmet customer needs, then 
addressing them in the moment with 
digital nudges and personalized offers.
• Increasing the productivity and efficiency of our sales force through lead 
management and propensity models.
• Predicting in real time the likelihood 
of fraud to better protect customers 
and the firm.
• Supporting specialists with AI advancements like call prediction, real-time 
insights and intelligent routing to drive 
customer and employee satisfaction. 
PROTECTING OUR CUSTOMERS 
AND THE FIRM
Risk management is core to our culture 
and a key competitive advantage, helping 
us build trust and providing security to 
customers. We are focused on protecting 
shareholders, customers and the firm by 
maintaining our fortress balance sheet, 
strong controls environment and throughthe-cycle decision-making approach.
CULTIVATING TALENT 
The work we do matters to customers, 
communities and the economy overall. Our 
goal is always to attract and retain great 
talent and create a culture where everyone’s voice matters. We help employees 
build a long-term career at the firm and 
have a workforce that reflects the communities we serve. Our high-performance 
culture rewards the hard work, heart and 
humanity that our more than 140,000 
employees deliver every day. All of this 
leads to the best business outcomes. 
ACQUIRING FIRST REPUBLIC 
In the midst of widespread instability in 
the banking sector, it was the strength 
and breadth of our franchise and the 
dedication of thousands of employees 
that enabled us to complete the acquisition of virtually all of First Republic’s 
assets in one weekend. 
We had long admired First Republic’s 
capabilities and culture of client service,

across the wealth spectrum, but the 
acquisition will help us deepen relationships with the affluent segment. In 2023, 
we prioritized stabilizing First Republic’s 
existing business. We retained the vast 
majority of customers, and deposits have 
increased approximately 20% since the 
acquisition. While we are on track against 
key integration milestones, 2024 will be 
critical as we aim to largely complete 
integration efforts by year-end. 
2024 LOOK AHEAD
Macro factors 
The macro environment going forward 
will likely look very different from 2023. 
While we anticipate the Federal Reserve 
will lower rates this year, the trajectory 
is still uncertain. Lower rates will be a 
headwind for deposit margins but a 
tailwind for businesses such as Home 
Lending. The diversification of our 
franchise provides natural offsets 
and hedges and creates resiliency in 
earnings and performance.
We are rigorous in monitoring our portfolios at a granular level using multiple 
data sources to assess direct risk and the 
overall health of consumers and small 
businesses. Based on what we’re seeing, 
consumers and small businesses both 
still remain generally healthy. Although 
consumers have largely spent the excess 
cash reserves built up from the fiscal 
response to the pandemic, balance 
sheets remain strong. Spending on a per 
account basis is largely flat year-overyear. Delinquencies played out as 
expected in 2023, and credit card losses 
should fully normalize later this year. 
Regulatory environment
The banking industry is facing an unprecedented barrage of untested and unstudied proposed regulations and legislation 
targeting multiple aspects of our business. The combined impact of all of these 
— Basel III, Regulation II (Debit Card 
Interchange Fees), overdraft and late fee 
changes, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Sections 1033 and 1071, and 
the Credit Card Competition Act — will 
meaningfully disrupt the economics of 
consumer financial products and services. 
This level of intervention will lead to some 
combination of the following:
• Fewer financial products and services 
available, and the remaining ones will 
become more expensive and harder to 
access, especially for lower-income 
consumers. 
• Less investment and innovation in the 
financial services industry, leading to 
an erosion of the customer experience.
• More consolidation across the industry, 
which will limit consumer choice.
• More financial activity handled by 
nonbanks outside of the regulatory 
perimeter, increasing risk for 
consumers.
Of course, we will comply with the final 
rules and regulations and are relatively 
well-positioned to do so. However, 
consumers and small businesses will 
likely bear the largest burden. 
Our hand 
We continue to operate from a position of 
strength with a relentless focus on the 
customer, a proven strategy and the best 
team. We recognize headwinds on the 
horizon and will adapt accordingly, taking 
a through-the-cycle approach to managing our business. Moving forward, we’ll 
continue to:
• Execute with excellence and a focus on 
efficiency and flexibility as the environment around us changes.
• Engage with regulators on how 
current proposals will negatively 
impact consumers and the industry.
• Reshape our business where necessary 
in response to new regulations, balancing impacts to shareholders, customers 
and the communities we serve.
I remain very confident about the future 
of our franchise, yet approach the opportunities and challenges we’ll face with 
great humility.

COMMERCIAL & INVESTMENT BANK

Commercial & 
Investment Bank
I am equally thrilled to spend more of 
my time in my role as President and Chief 
Operating Officer, helping Jamie with 
firmwide, strategic priorities that will 
provide growth and opportunities for 
years to come.
My focus will be on driving synergies 
across our lines of business, accelerating 
our investments in growth and innovation, and optimizing our resources across 
the firm. Priorities include harnessing 
data and modernizing our technology 
infrastructure so we can apply artificial 
intelligence (AI) to our businesses. This 
will help identify efficiencies and areas of 
opportunity. I also want to make sure we 
continue to manage and deploy capital in 
ways that best serve our clients, particularly when they need it most.
In 2023, we made significant strides in 
key areas: 
In March, teams across our Consumer 
Banking, Private Banking, Commercial 
Banking and Investment Banking businesses joined forces to deliver the firm’s 
full support to the venture ecosystem in 
the aftermath of the regional banking turmoil. We are now exploring new ways to 
better serve this community, including 
tapping opportunities in the booming private markets so that we can compete 
effectively in this rapidly evolving area. 
Our payments capabilities also continue 
to strengthen and advance as we prioritize innovation and resiliency. We are 
unique in that we can compete with fintechs on customer experience and digital 
solutions while also offering the stability, 
expansive network and services of a 
global bank.
Technology is reshaping the financial 
services landscape, and we are channeling its transformative power. Among our 
efforts, we are already using AI to 
onboard customers faster, combat fraud 
and serve up more insights to clients.
We are pushing into new markets both at 
home and internationally. Whether it’s 
growing our presence in emerging markets, deepening our relationships with 
multinational corporations, or expanding 
our U.S. branch network and wealth management business, our strategy is guided 
by a commitment to clients, communities 
and long-term value creation.
The leadership positions we have today are 
the result of hard work and investment 
over many years. We know also how hard it 
is to stay ahead of the pack. My promise to 
you, our shareholders, is that we will not 
be complacent. We will stay humble and 
hungry and strive always to be the best, 
most respected financial firm in the world.
When Jamie asked me to lead a new organization 12 years ago, I was thrilled. The 
firm was combining its traditional Investment Bank with the Treasury & Securities 
Services division. 
The rationale was clear. The merger 
would create a massive franchise encompassing the industry’s most diverse and 
comprehensive solutions for the world’s 
largest and most prominent companies, 
governments and institutions. From capital raising and M&A advice to payments, 
trading and custody, the combined franchise would enable us to deliver a full 
range of products and solutions to clients 
around the world.
As others retrenched, we believed growth 
would come from being global and diversified, having scale and providing a complete client offering. So we merged two 
divisions, identified gaps and invested in 
global capabilities. To this day, I believe 
the decisions we made then set us up for 
the success that we’ve had for the last 
decade. The proof is in the revenue, 
returns, rankings and market share that 
we’ve discussed with you over the years.
This January, we announced the latest 
evolution of our corporate structure by 
merging two divisions once again: Commercial Banking (CB) with the Corporate 
& Investment Bank (CIB). 
As we integrate these top-notch franchises, I am delighted to hand the keys 
of this incredible organization to Jenn 
Piepszak and Troy Rohrbaugh. They are 
exceptional leaders in every way, and 
I know they will continue to work hard 
each day, leading our employees and 
serving our clients with heart, integrity 
and excellence.

A decline in M&A dealmaking and the 
higher interest rate environment led to 
subdued debt capital markets and a drop 
in our debt underwriting fees to $2.6 
billion in 2023 compared with $2.8 billion 
in 2022. A standout deal was the $31 
billion bond deal for Pfizer to fund its 
acquisition of cancer drug pioneer 
Seagen, in which the firm had a lead role.
In 2023, our equity underwriting fees 
were up 11% compared with 2022, and 
we gained market share year-over-year1. 
While market uncertainty dented confidence in initial public offerings (IPO), the 
franchise led two of the year’s biggest 
offerings, including the $5 billion IPO of 
British chip designer Arm Holdings and 
consumer health company Kenvue’s 
$4 billion debut. 
It was another strong year for our 
Markets business, which generated 
$28 billion in revenue. Some of the 
uncertainty that plagued investment 
banking activity kept trading desks busy 
as clients hedged and positioned themselves accordingly. Fixed Income Markets 
revenue was up 1% from 2022, driven 
by the Securitized Products Group and 
Credit, mainly offset by normalization in 
Currencies & Emerging Markets, while 
Equity Markets revenue dipped after 
a relatively strong performance in 2022.
Clients also voted J.P. Morgan the #1 
global research firm in Institutional 
Investor’s annual survey for the fourth 
year in a row. Our analysis of economies 
and markets, including research on 
some 5,200 companies across more than 
80 countries, is particularly sought after 
during turbulent times.
CIB Payments reported a record 
$9.3 billion in revenue in 2023, up from 
$7.6 billion in 2022, as it benefited from 
the higher interest rate environment. 
In January 2024, we announced an exciting new chapter in our decade-long 
growth story.
The decision to bring together the firm’s 
major wholesale businesses to form the 
Commercial & Investment Bank continues 
a journey we have been on for a while as 
we seek to better support clients from 
their early stages of growth through to 
international expansion, acquisitions 
and beyond.
The new combined business has the scale, 
business diversity and financial firepower 
to offer complete solutions across banking, trading, payments and custody to 
middle market businesses, global companies and governments in more than 100 
markets. 
We are deeply indebted to Daniel Pinto, 
who built the Corporate & Investment 
Bank over the last 12 years with leadership positions across products and 
regions1,2. In his time as CEO, the CIB grew 
revenue from $34 billion in 2011 to $49 
billion in 2023 and increased net income 
by more than 75% during the same 
period, and its Investment Banking and 
Markets businesses have been #1 franchises for over a decade1,2.
It is a privilege to lead this remarkable 
business, and we are thrilled about the 
opportunities still to come. But let us first 
reflect on the key events and highlights 
of our performance in 2023.
OUR PERFORMANCE IN 2023
In 2023, the CIB generated net income of 
$14 billion on $49 billion in revenue, mirroring 2022’s solid performance but down 
from 2021’s record highs. Strong trading 
results and record years for our deposittaking businesses cushioned the impact 
of industrywide weakness in investment 
banking activity, underscoring the benefits of our diversified business model.
The year included central banks hiking 
rates at the fastest pace in decades, a 
second year of war in Ukraine and the 
outbreak of conflict in the Middle East, 
the collapse of several U.S. regional 
banks and recession in parts of Europe. 
Throughout, J.P. Morgan offered its 
expertise and balance sheet, helping 
companies, financial institutions and 
governments weather the storm.
During the regional bank turmoil and 
resulting economic stress, the firm 
helped shore up the financial system 
and the economy, stepping in with billions of dollars in liquidity to help 
banks, their clients and investors navigate the crisis. This was complemented 
by the firm helping to raise $155 billion 
for financial institutions in 2023.
Worldwide investment banking activity 
was hit by the uncertain economic outlook and market conditions. Industrywide fees shrank to a 10-year low1, and 
dealmaking remained subdued, causing 
our own investment banking revenue 
to dip slightly, to $6.2 billion from $6.5 
billion in 2022. Even so, the business 
maintained its #1 ranking in global 
investment banking fees with a wallet 
share of 8.8%1. We also ranked #1 in 
debt capital markets, #2 in mergers and 
acquisitions (M&A), and rose to #1 in 
equity capital markets1.
Our M&A franchise advised on nearly 
350 deals totaling more than $700 billion in volume1, including some of the 
year’s largest announced transactions: 
the $42 billion separation of Johnson 
& Johnson’s consumer health business, 
agricultural supplier Viterra’s $17 billion 
merger with U.S. oilseed and grain 
processor Bunge, and sandwich chain 
Subway’s $10 billion sale to Roark 
Capital, one of the biggest transactions 
in fast food history.

COMMERCIAL & INVESTMENT BANK

Securities Services, our fourth major line 
of business in the CIB, also had a record 
year, reporting $4.8 billion in revenue. 
Sitting adjacent to the industry’s largest 
Markets business, it provides post-trade 
services to institutional asset-manager 
and asset-owner clients, providing safekeeping, settlement and related services 
for securities in approximately 100 
markets around the world. Since the 
CIB was formed in 2012, the Securities 
Services business has nearly doubled 
assets under custody from $17 trillion at 
the end of 2011 to $32 trillion at the end 
of 20233. In recent years, investments 
in technology have enhanced the scale 
and resiliency of its platforms, enabling 
the business to grow revenue and secure 
major new mandates. 
SIZING UP THE OPPORTUNITIES 
AHEAD
J.P. Morgan has an exceptional blend of 
strengths that have continued to deliver 
value over time. The completeness of our 
products and services, talent, ongoing 
investments in digital technology and 
tools, client focus and fortress balance 
sheet have given the CIB strong share 
positions across almost all areas1,2. 
We are not complacent about these leadership positions. The competitive landscape for our businesses is intensifying, 
driven by both traditional banks as well 
as further growth of nonbank financial 
institutions. Core to our strategy is looking very closely at all areas of the business and pinpointing where there are 
weaknesses and opportunities to grow. 
Here are some of our target areas:
The benefits of integration
This year we are integrating our major 
wholesale businesses Commercial Banking 
and the Corporate & Investment Bank. 
There are more connections between the

two businesses than ever before. In 2023, 
over $3 billion in gross Investment Banking and Markets revenue6 and more than 
$8 billion in firmwide Payments revenue, 
almost half, came from Commercial 
Banking clients7. With our extensive footprint in the middle market, combined 
with our Investment Banking franchise, 
we are uniquely positioned to support 
middle market clients as they grow in 
size and complexity.
At the same time, our biggest multinational 
and asset manager clients are navigating 
an increasingly complex set of challenges 
and need a banking partner with the scale, 
global reach and full-service offering to 
resolve them. With employees around the 
world supporting clients in more than 100 
countries, the newly enlarged business is 
among the most complete institutional 
client franchises in the industry. Wherever 
companies are on their growth journey, the 
newly combined business will have the 
resources and coverage to help.
Trading at scale 
Our trading business operates at huge 
scale.
In 2023, in the U.S. alone, it handled more 
than 42 billion client orders and helped 
investors buy and sell nearly $11 trillion 
in 12,000 equity securities.
Our strategy of being a complete 
counterparty is paying off, with our 
biggest institutional clients choosing to 
do more business with us. Accordingly, 
the bank’s share of the institutional 
client wallet has grown from 11.1% in 
2018 to 13.9% in 20238.
Being there for clients in all markets and 
conditions, however, demands a significant amount of capital. Although this is a 
headwind, the business continues to provide solid returns, and we remain focused 
on the disciplined allocation of capital 
while preparing for updated U.S. capital 
requirements.
As assets and international trade flows 
increase, we are modernizing platforms 
by moving to the cloud and increasing 
automation to handle greater volumes at 
lower cost.
To capture market share, institutional 
trading needs to be easy and intuitive. 
We are investing to enhance the trading 
experience for clients across the life cycle 
of their trades, from onboarding to pretrade services like research, execution, 
post-trade settlement and data services. 
We are investing heavily in the electronification of our credit business, bringing 
across some of the technology and 
approach behind our Equities business. 
Among other initiatives in 2023, 
J.P. Morgan launched a new algorithmic 
trading offering to U.S. Treasury investors 
to capture share in the world’s most 
important bond market.
Private capital markets 
Private markets — both credit and equity 
— have grown significantly over the past 
decade. The private credit market has 
grown nearly fourfold over the last 10 
years to more than $1.6 trillion9, while 
money raised in venture capital and private equity growth deals has more than 
doubled over the same period10. 
Our borrower and investor clients are on 
both sides of this growth, and we are 
well-positioned to serve the full range of 
their needs. We are growing our solutionagnostic credit strategy, deploying balance 
sheet where it makes sense for direct 
lending, in addition to our existing financing and structured solutions. We are also 
enhancing our offering for asset managers 
and financial sponsors looking to deploy 
capital. As the private markets continue to 
evolve, we will remain a significant player 
with a goal of providing clients with a full 
range of financing options.

With the acquisition of First Republic Bank 
and collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, we 
have a unique opportunity to expand our 
support for the Innovation Economy — the 
ecosystem of venture-backed companies, 
founders and investors, who rely on the 
private markets. In the past, these efforts 
were led largely by Commercial Banking. 
With our new combined franchise, we 
can now better serve this dynamic, fastgrowing client base. We want to make 
clients-for-life out of the legions of tech 
companies and their founders by supporting them from the earliest stages of 
growth up to IPO and beyond.
Capital for the climate 
In 2023, we continued to help clients 
with their sustainability goals as well as 
scaling green solutions. Since 2021, the 
CIB has financed and facilitated $230 
billion for green activities toward our 
firmwide target of $1 trillion by 2030, 
primarily by supporting clients with green 
bond underwriting and financing for 
renewable and clean energy. From financing and capital raising to strategic advice, 
we are working closely with clients across 
industries as they aim to meet their own 
long-term sustainability targets.
Investing for the future
We are investing to scale and enhance the 
resiliency of our core platforms and are 
pioneering new technologies to move 
faster and improve the client experience.
Across the business, we are exploring use 
cases for artificial intelligence. In Markets, 
our AI-powered Client Intelligence platform is starting to use data from across 
the business to create recommendations 
based on client interactions, and our Prime 
Finance team is harnessing AI to better 
manage the inventory of securities we 
have on hand for clients while optimizing 
our balance sheet for capital efficiency. 
Elsewhere, AI has improved the onboarding experience for clients, speeding up and 
improving the accuracy of our Know Your 
Customer procedures, while in Investment 
Banking, the technology is helping coverage teams to pinpoint when companies 
might need to tap the equity markets.
Our Payments business moves nearly 
$10 trillion13 each day, with capabilities to 
send payments in more than 120 currencies across 160 countries. We are futureproofing its platforms and investing to 
help businesses across industries, such as 
healthcare and e-commerce accept and 
make payments more seamlessly. In 
Securities Services, an increasing focus is 
to provide better data services to help 
investor clients improve the performance 
of their portfolios and the operational 
efficiency of their businesses. In 2023, we 
launched the first commercial offerings 
on our Fusion platform, giving clients 
access to their custody, fund accounting 
and middle office data via API or the 
cloud. We also rolled out a tool that helps 
clients gather, cleanse and organize ESG 
data from different sources. 
LOOKING AHEAD
The start of 2024 has brought some early 
encouraging signs for investment banking 
activity but a more mixed outlook for our 
Markets business.
Several risks remain. Economies are still 
adjusting to life after the pandemic and 
the injection of trillions of dollars in 
monetary and fiscal stimulus; geopolitical 
challenges continue to flare; and the 
competitive threat is intensifying. The 
outcome of these is inherently unknown 
— they could provide both headwinds and 
opportunities for our business.
The consistent returns created by the scale 
and diversity of our franchise allow us to 
keep investing through economic cycles. 
We are global with capabilities at scale, 
and now combined with Commercial 
Banking, we have the ability to become 
even more client-centric.
Our products, services and reach coupled 
with incredible people and our winning 
culture make us especially hopeful about 
the future of our business.
It is an honor for both of us to lead this 
world-class franchise, and we are excited 
for the opportunities in front of us.

Supporting the Innovation Economy: 
The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in 
March of last year was a profound 
moment. Thousands of founders, companies and investors needed to protect their 
liquidity and make payroll. Many came to 
us, and we were ready. Because of our 
focus and significant investments to serve 
the Innovation Economy (IE) over the past 
decade, we were prepared. 
In 2023, we accelerated our strategy to 
support this important segment of our 
economy by: 
• Adding approximately two years’ 
worth of clients in just two months, 
with our team working around the clock 
for weeks to assist clients and open 
thousands of new accounts
• Hiring more than 200 experienced 
bankers and senior leaders across key 
markets
• Expanding our IE presence in eight 
countries, including Australia, China, 
Germany, Ireland, Israel, Nordics and 
the United Kingdom
• Establishing Startup and Climate Tech 
Banking teams to provide deep sector 
expertise
• Providing tailored capabilities, such as 
early-stage venture lending and capital 
raising 
• Investing in platforms that deliver 
seamless digital experiences and integrated payments offerings specifically 
designed for startups and high-growth 
companies
Acquiring First Republic Bank: JPMorgan 
Chase’s acquisition of First Republic Bank 
(FRB) was another notable highlight of 
2023. Given the overlap with CB, FRB 
offers a tremendous opportunity to 
COMMERCIAL BANKING
2023 was a dynamic and complex year, 
marked by geopolitical tensions, stubborn 
inflation, rapidly rising interest rates and 
a regional banking crisis. Through it all, 
Commercial Banking (CB) served as a 
source of stability for our clients and 
communities and remained focused on 
executing our strategic priorities.
Amidst this market disruption, our team 
rose to the occasion to support thousands 
of new clients, expand into key markets 
and accelerate growth across our business. CB’s exceptional performance 
reflects the strength of our franchise, 
ongoing client focus, and sustained investments in our platforms and capabilities: 
• Record revenue of $15.5 billion, up 
35% year-over-year, reflecting higher 
net interest income, client acquisition 
and expansion into new markets
• Record net income of $6.1 billion, up 
46% year-over-year, and a 20% return 
on equity
• Record Payments revenue of $8.3 
billion, a 45% increase year-over-year
• Gross Investment Banking revenue of 
$3.4 billion, a 14% increase 
year-over-year
• Strong credit performance, with net 
charge-offs of 12 basis points 
I’m incredibly proud of our outstanding 
operational and financial performance.

drove our success.

Developing powerful solutions: Our 
firm delivers end-to-end solutions to 
help our clients run their businesses 
more efficiently and fuel their growth. 
Through firmwide partnerships, CB 
offers customized capabilities, such 
as bundled services for startups and 
specialized payments offerings for 
segments like healthcare, real estate 
and government. These broad-based 
global offerings serve our clients 
through every stage of their life cycle.
Delivering an exceptional experience: 
CB is making great progress to optimize 
our clients’ journey across every touchpoint, including faster onboarding times, 
streamlined documentation and intuitive, 
self-service tools. As an example, we’ve 
been able to reduce our onboarding time 
to under 48 hours for a number of new 
clients, and we’re working to scale this 
experience. Informed by our clients’ 
needs and expectations, we’ll continue to 
invest in our operations and platforms to 
offer simple, efficient and digital-first 
experiences to our clients of all sizes. 
Harnessing the power of our data: CB 
has invested in tools and capabilities 
to harness the full power of our data. 
We’ve worked to combine our proprietary 
data with third-party sources to form an 
integrated, comprehensive data asset 
that enables us to better understand our 
clients’ needs, manage risk and drive 
operational efficiency. 
Empowering our team: One of CB’s key 
differentiators is — and always has been 
— our people. We provide our team with 
specialized training, collaboration and 
workflow tools, and content targeted to 
seamlessly address clients’ needs. Access 
to personalized data and analytics helps 
our team develop deep sector expertise 
and insights to serve clients in a highly 
differentiated manner. 
Focus on community impact
CB has played an instrumental role in 
supporting the neighborhoods where we 
live and work. Our purpose-driven business helps to create an inclusive economy, narrow the racial wealth gap and 
drive sustainable economic growth. We’re 
a pivotal part of the firm’s community 
impact, but our work is more than that — 
it’s essential to uplifting the places we 
call home.
In 2023 alone, CB extended more than 
$18 billion to help communities thrive, 
including:

close to 5,000 2 businesses last year and 
added roughly 500 bankers to build these 
relationships. In addition to supporting 
clients in all 50 states, we established a 
presence in Israel, Malaysia and Singapore, increasing our coverage of non-U.S. 
headquartered clients across 27 countries.

NOTABLE #1 RECOGNITIONS IN 2023

Our future is bright
By all measures, 2023 was a standout 
year with our success driven 100% by our 
people. I’d like to extend my heartfelt 
gratitude to my extraordinary CB colleagues and partners across the firm 
whose unwavering commitment not only 
contributed to our performance but also 
supported our clients throughout this 
remarkable year. 
My continued confidence in our future 
reflects our proven strategy, as well as 
our commitment to being our clients’ 
most important financial partner. An 
ambitious agenda awaits, and we’re not 
standing still. To build upon our strong 
momentum, we’ll remain disciplined as 
we accelerate our investments to drive 
our business forward. 
As announced earlier this year, we’re 
excited to bring together the strengths 
and capabilities of CB and the Corporate 
& Investment Bank. This strategic combination further solidifies our strong partnerships across wholesale banking and 
creates the most global, complete and 
diversified Commercial & Investment 
Bank in the world. With an incredible 
team, extraordinary client franchise, 
iconic brand and unmatched capabilities, 
one thing is abundantly clear: Our future 
is bright.

SPOTLIGHT ON NEW YORK CITY
NEW YORK CITY
For over 200 years, JPMorgan Chase has proudly served clients and communities across New York City (NYC). CB supports over 
7,000 clients in NYC and has extended nearly $9 billion in financing to affordable housing developers, vital institutions and local 
businesses since 2019. 
Through a multimillion-dollar investment 
and a dedicated team, the firm is helping 
Carver Federal Savings Bank serve 
communities through its seven NYC 
branches, including four in Brooklyn. 
Founded in 1948, Carver is one of the 
nation’s largest Black-managed minority 
depository institutions and a community 
development financial institution. 
CB has supported The City of New York 
for more than 50 years, providing 60 
NYC agencies with services, including 
lending, fraud prevention, treasury 
services, and more.
CB invested in $10.6 million of New Markets 
Tax Credit allocation to expand Urban Health 
Plan’s Plaza Del Sol Family Health Center. 
This facility provides access to primary and 
specialty care, behavioral health, nutrition, 
telehealth, and social services, such as the 
Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program. 
CB provided Bronx Pro Group and Services 
for the Underserved with a $51 million standby 
letter of credit to support the new construction 
of Melrose North. This development includes 
170 units of affordable housing, improved 
energy efficiency and tenant amenities, and 
a youth training and employment center.

A landmark year setting the stage for 
future success
RECORD NEW CLIENTS AND FLOWS
Nearly half a trillion dollars — $490 billion 
to be precise. That sum represents how 
much net new money clients entrusted to 
J.P. Morgan Asset & Wealth Management 
(AWM) last year. During times of financial 
crises or market uncertainty, J.P. Morgan 
shines even brighter as a port in the 
storm — and 2023 was no exception. 
The U.S. regional banking crises served as 
a stark reminder that banking and lending are not to be treated as a commodity. 
As a reflection of this awareness, AWM 
drew an influx of client flows last year at a 
rate nearly twice that of our closest publicly listed competitor.
STRONG INVESTMENT 
PERFORMANCE AND LEADING 
SOLUTIONS FOR CLIENTS
As a fiduciary, delivering strong, longterm investment performance is our foremost priority. Approximately 80% of 
J.P. Morgan Asset Management assets 
under management (AUM) outperformed 
the peer median over a 10-year time 
period. This exceptional investment performance is an outcome of decades of 
refinement and involves close to 1,300 
investment professionals along with one 
of the industry’s largest research budgets, 
which enables us to actively cover nearly 
2,500 public companies, with over 5,000 
company visits annually. This has resulted 
in 93% of our equity assets outperforming 
their peers over the past decade. 
Achieving outstanding investment results 
is never easy, but after several years of 
extensive quantitative easing — which 
often led to undifferentiated asset moves 
in concert with one another — we are 
returning to a market that prioritizes fundamentals in valuing companies and 
securities, giving us plenty of reasons to 
be optimistic about the future for our 
investors across asset classes.
We provide our clients with expertise 
and effective solutions to support them 
through all market cycles and prepare 
them for the future. Equipped with stateof-the-art technology and artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced tools and capabilities, our advisors stand ready to guide 
our clients and deliver more personalized 
offerings — from the first dollar they

invest in the markets to the decisions 
they make about their long-term retirement planning. Simultaneously, to assist 
our clients in navigating the intricacies of 
retirement, we offer robust strategies 
through our SmartRetirement solutions.
Our dedication to research is at the heart 
of everything we do, from stock selection 
to unique market and asset allocation 
insights. For example, we deliver exclusive insights to our clients through our 
proprietary, industry-leading Eye on the 
Market and J.P. Morgan Guide to the 
Markets, viewed by hundreds of thousands of financial advisors and millions 
of clients every year. And we draw on 
the depth and breadth of our market and 
economic expertise to provide insights 
into investment themes to enable more 
confident portfolio decisions. Clients rely 
on us to help them distinguish the signals 
from the noise.
IMPRESSIVE RESULTS FOR 
SHAREHOLDERS
Our success across our preeminent diversified investment and client franchises 
drives our consistent growth. This year, 
our total client assets grew to a record 
$5 trillion, our revenue to a record $20 billion and our pre-tax income to a record $7 
billion — resulting in a return on equity of 
31%. These results underscore the power 
of a global, highly diversified platform 
with exceptional investment performance 
and dedicated client service. 
PERSONALIZATION, GOVERNANCE 
AND STEWARDSHIP
I have never in my time running the AWM 
franchise found two clients alike in their 
needs, goals and risk tolerances for their 
assets. For a sovereign wealth fund or 
a first-time individual investor, investing 
is deeply nuanced in terms of volatility 
tolerances, income and distribution 
requirements, taxes, preferences and 
passions. The proprietary technologies 
we gained from our acquisitions of 55ip 
and OpenInvest, for example, enable us 
to combine over 600 different investment strategies to create highly customized portfolios in a smart, efficient way. 
We know our clients have a choice — not 
only in managers and investment styles 
but also in preferences around sectors or 
tilts and, where appropriate, in a taxoptimized way. We do not believe it is 
J.P. Morgan’s job to tell clients what to 
include or exclude inside their portfolio 
sectors or stock selection. Instead, we 
empower clients to guide us and drive 
their own decisions. 
And because preferences are often 
personal in nature, we are steadfast in 
focusing our stewardship on voting 
matters that maximize long-term shareholder value and good governance. With 
the increased prevalence of outsourcing 
proxy voting, by the end of 2024, generally 
we will have eliminated third-party proxy 
advisor voting recommendations from our 
internally developed voting systems. We 
believe these enhancements will allow 
companies to better understand our independent rationale regarding voting issues.

and thought leadership are critical elements. I am confident that our capabilities and commitment to future-focused 
investments, as well as enhancements 
using technology and AI, will bolster our 
ability to serve our clients and empower 
them to attain their future success. By 
achieving optimal results through these 
efforts, clients reward us with their 
flows, and future growth will follow. 
Furthermore, we hold a unique advantage that sets us apart from all of our 
competitors: Being part of JPMorgan 
Chase provides us with unmatched 
resources, opportunities and scale.
I am so proud of how we helped our 
clients and shareholders navigate the 
challenges of 2023 and previous market 
cycles. Our industry-leading growth of 
client assets is a testament to our unwavering commitment to delivering on our 
fiduciary responsibilities and dedication 
to serving clients’ best interests. We are 
deeply grateful for this trust and will 
continue to strive for excellence in all 
we do, each and every day.
in the world (JPMorgan Equity Premium 
Income, JPMorgan Ultra-Short Income 
and JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium 
Income). We persist in our efforts 
to innovate, expanding our offerings 
by launching 17 new solutions (12 U.S. 
and five UCITS) in the past year. We 
are equally enthusiastic about our 
separately managed account (SMA) 
platform. Acquiring 55ip enabled us to 
provide our clients with improved tax 
management and portfolio customization, and our clients now have greater 
control over their investments and taxes. 
Since the acquisition, our AUM increased 
16-fold in this area.
Alternatives
As a top 10 manager and investor, with 
more than $400 billion in assets and 
a 60-year legacy, we continue to invest 
in scaling and expanding our alternatives 
capabilities across private equity, hedge 
funds, private credit, real estate and 
infrastructure. After launching J.P. Morgan 
Private Capital two years ago, we successfully introduced technology, consumer 
and life sciences strategies. As access 
to alternatives continues to widen, we 
launched J.P. Morgan Real Estate Income 
Trust (JPMREIT) and JPMorgan Private 
Markets Fund (JPMF), which is one of the 
industry’s first private equity funds available to individual investors. Overall, alternatives across AWM continue to grow.
Acquisitions
Global Shares, a share plan administrator 
of both public and private companies 
around the world, is one of our most 
recent acquisitions. As we build out our 
broader J.P. Morgan Workplace offering, 
we are leveraging Global Shares as the 
foundation to help new companies accelerate growth and encourage employees and 
owners to invest. With plan participants 
from over 100 countries, the number 
continues to grow — up 15% this past year. 
Just as impressive, client assets are up 
32% since the acquisition. We also completed the acquisition of China International Fund Management (CIFM), rebranding it as J.P. Morgan Asset Management 
(China). We commemorated this pivotal 
rebrand by moving 400 new onshore colleagues into Shanghai Tower. This served 
not only as a celebration but also as a 
testament to our shared heritage, global 
strengths and deep-rooted expertise in 
the local market, as J.P. Morgan’s history 
in China dates back more than 100 years. 
A rigorously controlled environment 
To ensure scalable growth, we are 
committed to operational excellence — 
from enhancing trades, client transactions and money movement to simplifying 
interactions and implementing robust 
controls and safeguards. Some of these 
efforts are being further enhanced using 
AI to streamline our processes, manage 
risk and make informed decisions to 
protect our clients. Additionally, these 
investments in our infrastructure help 
us — as fiduciaries — perform optimized 
stress testing of client portfolios on a 
consistent basis.
CONCLUSION
As I have said from the beginning of my 
tenure as CEO of AWM, our focus is on 
being the best in the industry, not the 
biggest. And by best, I mean the best 
performer for clients. Advice is not a 
simple commodity. Strong investment

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY

Corporate Responsibility
Across the firm, we believe that the 
strength of our company is inextricably 
linked to the vitality of our communities. 
When families do well, we do well. When 
communities thrive, we thrive. 
In Corporate Responsibility (CR), we put 
this philosophy into action by operating at 
the nexus of business, policy and community. We understand that complex problems aren’t solved with a single grant or 
meeting but rather require multifaceted 
solutions. This is why we have brought 
together our philanthropy, government 
relations, research and policy, sustainability and community engagement functions 
to tackle inclusive economic growth as 
one team. Our integrated model allows 
us to tap a wide-ranging set of tools and 
perspectives to address societal issues 
impacting our clients, customers and 
employees and drive favorable conditions 
for the firm’s continued success. 
We are not just committed to delivering for 
communities — we are built for it. With 
team members around the globe, we partner with local residents to understand 
what’s happening on the ground and how 
JPMorgan Chase can use its unique expertise and resources to maximize impact. 
Recognizing that there is no one-size-fitsall approach, our local strategies are informed by global insights yet intentionally tailored to the local context, whether that is 
a region, neighborhood or even city block.
To me, there is nothing more rewarding 
than seeing our impact up close. In that 
spirit, I invite you to learn about our work 
in Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia 
(Greater Washington); the United Kingdom 
(U.K.); Dallas-Fort Worth; and Chicago. 
These place-based case studies showcase 
the breadth and depth of our engagements in hundreds of communities around 
the world — and show that working in 
lockstep with communities is critical to 
promoting a strong business environment. 
GREATER WASHINGTON
Landscape
While the firm has operated in Greater 
Washington for more than 50 years, over 
the past decade we have made a concerted 
effort to advance our business footprint by 
opening new branches, hiring local employees, lending to small businesses and contributing in other ways. We have intentionally invested in areas where we can grow 
alongside communities and help residents 
achieve financial security, especially in 
Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, two cities 
with significant racial wealth divides. 
Our approach
We have pursued initiatives to address 
these disparities and lift up the region’s 
residents and workforce. 
• In D.C., we provided $3 million to help 
launch the Congress Heights Community 
Training and Development Corporation’s 
(CHCTDC) small business career and skills 
building incubator in Wards 7 and 8.
• We partnered with Baltimore’s Mayor’s 
Office of Employment Development 
to launch our Baltimore Virtual Call 
Center, hiring 40 Baltimore-based customer service specialists and leaders.
• Working with the Greater Washington 
Partnership and Education Strategy 
Group — and with support from local 
government leaders in D.C., Maryland 
and Virginia — we recommitted $5.4 
million to the TalentReady initiative to 
support the preparation of high school 
students across the region for in-demand 
careers, building on our previous commitment that engaged more than 25,000 
students across five school districts.
Our impact in action
We first worked with Monica Ray at 
CHCTDC, where she had served as the 
organization’s executive director for 
more than two decades. Monica has 
devoted her career to her community, 
attracting investment to help improve 
Wards 7 and 8’s low homeownership and 
high poverty and unemployment rates. 
After years of collaborating on CHCTDC 
initiatives and the opening of Chase’s 
Community Center Branch in Skyland 
Town Center, Monica shared her vision 
about helping to launch a small business 
career and skills building incubator.
“We are providing support and coaching 
for promising new businesses, as well as 
for entrepreneurs still in the idea stage,” 
she says. “Our JPMorgan Chase partnership 
helps us arm these socially and economically disadvantaged women entrepreneurs 
with the processes and systems they need 
to succeed in their business ventures.”
Monica and her team have already helped 
launch 83 new businesses and are growing 47 more, creating jobs and building 
individual and community wealth.
THE UNITED KINGDOM
Landscape
The U.K. has long been an important market for our firm. With over 22,000 employees, our offerings have continued to grow 
with the 2021 launch of the Chase digital 
consumer bank and the expansion in the 
U.K. of our commercial banking, investment banking and asset management 
businesses. While our presence has 
evolved, the country’s economic landscape 
has experienced historic changes, with 
ongoing income inequality and nearly 22% 
of U.K. residents living in poverty .

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY

Our approach
To address some of the challenges facing 
the U.K., we have focused on helping businesses succeed, supporting individuals as 
they build a strong financial future and 
connecting people to job opportunities. 
This has included committing $64 million in 
philanthropic capital over the past five 
years, alongside the firm’s active employee 
volunteerism programs, civic partnerships, 
and close engagements with government 
and nonprofits. We have also promoted 
efforts to boost the U.K.’s leadership in 
sustainable finance, providing input on a 
report offering recommendations the U.K. 
can take to unlock capital at scale to transition to a more sustainable energy system.
Examples of our work to benefit local 
communities and economic growth include: 
• The Aspiring Professionals Program 
(APP), run in collaboration with the 
Social Mobility Foundation, works to 
connect talented young people from 
low-income backgrounds with work 
and mentorship experiences at 
JPMorgan Chase. 
• The Founders Forward mentoring 
program pairs women entrepreneurs in 
the U.K. with JPMorgan Chase mentors, 
who provide business strategy and 
leadership development guidance. 
Our impact in action
Over the past five years, our collective 
work with nonprofits has helped more 
than 33,000 people reduce their debts and 
improve their financial health. We have 
also provided resources to support the 
growth of over 10,000 small businesses 
and place 9,000+ individuals into apprenticeships or full- or part-time positions. 
Since launching in 2012, the APP has supported more than 800 young people, 86% 
of whom began full-time employment at 
JPMorgan Chase or other firms within 15 
months of graduation. Radhika, currently a 
vice president with the firm’s Global Rates 
team, enrolled in APP. She credits the 
program with helping her build the skills 
she needed for the interview process and 
now in her sales role at the firm. 
Founders Forward is also changing lives. 
Approximately 240 women entrepreneurs 
in the U.K. have participated in the program. This includes Elle, whose business 
won a startup accelerator competition 
and expanded to the United States. 
In addition to the U.K., we are proud to 
offer Founders Forward in France and 
Germany, further embedding our commitment to fostering entrepreneurship into 
the fabric of our global company.
DALLAS-FORT WORTH
Landscape
Texas is home to our largest employee 
base in the United States. With many 
companies like ours recognizing Texas as 
a great place to do business, the state is 
currently experiencing a skilled-labor 
shortage, specifically in the Dallas-Fort 
Worth area. This local challenge will 
persist: Although 85% of living-wage 
jobs in Dallas County require education 
beyond a high school degree, as of 2017, 
73% of Texas’ students were not able 
to receive postsecondary credentials 
within six years, largely due to financial 
obstacles.
Our approach
To help young people access educational 
and skills training opportunities, we 
began advising and funding data-driven 
nonprofits, including the Commit 
Partnership and Tarrant To & Through (T3) 
Partnership, coalitions of school systems, 
higher education institutions, local 
and state governments, foundations, 
employers and workforce agencies, 
among others.
While these organizations work to 
address compounding issues that impact 
student success and graduation rates, our 
commitments are deliberately focused on 
initiatives where we have expertise and 
insights to add the greatest value. In 
2023, we committed:
• $1.5 million to The Commit Partnership’s Opportunity 2040 Plan Phase 1 
to support a comprehensive 18-year 
investment plan to help improve the 
long-term financial health of 150,000 
current students by 2040. 
• $750,000 to the T3 Pathways to 
Careers (P2C) platform to provide a 
virtual college-to-career resource to 
help parents and students understand 
what’s needed to pursue industrybased credentials, degrees, certifications and job opportunities. 
We also promote policies at the local, 
state and federal levels that align with our 
goals. Since 2022, we have been a vocal 
champion of Texas’s House Bill 8 legislation that creates a new funding model that 
incentivizes community colleges in Texas 
to ensure that more students complete 
certificates and other credentials or transfer to a four-year university to complete 
their undergraduate degree.
Our impact in action
Halfway through the first year, Commit2Dallas’s Opportunity 2040 Plan has 
already met 87% of its year 1 goal: to 
help an additional 7,700 students reach 
educational benchmarks that put them 
on a pathway to well-paying jobs. This 
work is touching Dallas County families 
like the Donjuans, whose oldest daughter 
Annahi will graduate from the University 
of North Texas at Dallas this spring. 
“I’m the first on both sides of my family 
… to obtain higher education,” says 
Annahi. “I decided to attend college in 
order to start saving and serve as a role 
model for my siblings.” 
Featured above: Elle

We are seeing a similar impact from our 
T3 P2C commitment. Over the next six 
months, T3 will integrate its platform with 
the registration process for all Fort Worth 
Independent School District middle 
school students, which will give approximately 15,000 students valuable information about educational opportunities at 
various high schools and careers they can 
pursue as an adult. 
CHICAGO
Landscape
For more than 160 years, our firm has 
served Chicago, a city ripe with business 
opportunities — along with its share of 
challenges. Between 2017 and 2019, 
several reports captured the stark segregation and inequities among communities 
in Chicago, underscoring devastating 
impacts on economic vitality.
Our approach
Looking at this research and findings 
from the JPMorgan Chase Institute, we 
recognized an opportunity to change 
the decades-long trajectory of the city’s 
South and West Sides from disinvestment 
to revitalization. Following conversations 
with policymakers and residents, we 
focused on addressing the city’s affordable home shortage as an opportunity 
to catalyze wealth building. 
To leverage vacant city-owned land, CR 
deepened partnerships with nonprofits 
building affordable homes in coordination 
with local government, including The 
Resurrection Project, Reclaiming Chicago 
and the Chicago Community Trust. These 
organizations target city blocks to acquire 
and build homes, supporting individual 
and community wealth. They also connect 
people with affordable mortgages and 
help them plan for costs like maintenance 
and repairs. Additionally, our businesses 
combined expertise to make one of our 
largest-ever affordable housing investments in redeveloping the Lawson YMCA 
into 400+ affordable housing units.
Our impact in action
We see returns on our commitments in the 
pride and promise of new homeowners, 
including Janay, a public school teacher. 
Janay saved part of every paycheck to purchase her first home and put down roots.
 
“As a teacher, building a sense of community is one of the first things I do with my 
students at the beginning of the year. It 
is a way of making students feel safe, 
valued and supported. This home does 
the same for me,” she reports.
Janay’s inspiring story is one of many. 
Housing production from a collaborative 
of organizations — funded in part through 
grants from JPMorgan Chase — surged 
from 19 homes in 2022 to 79 homes in 
2023, demonstrating significant progress 
toward the collaborative’s goal of scaling 
production to more than 100 homes per 
year through 2030.
This is just the beginning. In addition to 
deploying $1.1 million in home loans and 
raising $50 million toward lending and 
home construction, our grantees have 
leveraged our philanthropic support to 
secure another 500 city-owned vacant 
lots and gain funding from the state of 
Illinois focused on assisting with down 
payments and closing appraisal gaps.
LOOKING AHEAD 
The essence of our work outlined 
above can be captured in three words: 
We show up. As listeners, learners and 
community partners, we come to the 
table — real, tangible tables — ready to 
create avenues to economic opportunity.
At these various tables, we ask: “What’s 
working?” We examine our investments 
with our colleagues across the firm and 
external partners, gaining an understanding of how winning approaches can be 
scaled to markets around the world. Our 
team’s work ensuring that policymakers 
know the value we bring to communities 
becomes all the more important as we 
seek to scale solutions during this uncertain political moment. It is in tandem with 
elected officials and other stakeholders 
that we have brought, and will continue 
to bring, the right products and services 
to our clients and customers.
And when we show up, in good and in 
tough times, we will bring our holistic 
model, positioning ourselves to grow and 
truly be the bank for the place we are in, 
in every market we serve. We take this 
responsibility seriously. It is a privilege 
to bank more than 88 million customers 
and small businesses. It is a privilege to 
support schools, hospitals and other 
community institutions. But perhaps most 
of all, it is a privilege to lead by example, 
demonstrating through our business 
success that the private sector has a 
role to play in shaping a stronger, more 
inclusive economy for everyone.

Firmwide overview

2023, up 32%, earnings per share of $16.23, ROE of 17% 
and ROTCE of 21%.
• Total net revenue was $158.1 billion, up 23%, 
reflecting: 
– Net interest income (“NII”) of $89.3 billion, up 34%, 
driven by higher rates, the impact of First Republic, and 
higher revolving balances in Card Services, partially 
offset by lower Markets net interest income and lower 
average deposit balances. NII excluding Markets was 
$90.0 billion, up 44%. 
– Noninterest revenue (“NIR”) was $68.8 billion, up 
11%, driven by the impact of First Republic, including 
the $2.8 billion estimated bargain purchase gain, 
higher Markets noninterest revenue, and higher asset 
management fees, partially offset by the absence of the 
gain on the sale of Visa B shares in the prior year, 
higher net securities losses in Treasury and CIO, and 
lower auto operating lease income.
• Noninterest expense was $87.2 billion, up 14%, 
predominantly driven by higher compensation expense, 
reflecting an increase in employees, primarily in 
technology and front office, as well as wage inflation. The 
increase in expense also includes the $2.9 billion FDIC 
special assessment and costs associated with the First 
Republic acquisition. 
• The provision for credit losses was $9.3 billion, 
reflecting $6.2 billion of net charge-offs and a net 
addition to the allowance for credit losses of $3.1 billion. 
Net charge-offs increased $3.3 billion, predominantly 
driven by Card Services, and to a lesser extent single 
name exposures in wholesale. The net addition to the 
allowance for credit losses included: 
– a net addition of $1.3 billion in consumer, 
predominantly driven by CCB, reflecting $1.4 billion in 
Card Services driven by loan growth, including an 
increase in revolving balances, partially offset by a net 
reduction of $200 million in Home Lending, and
– a net addition of $657 million in wholesale, driven by 
net downgrade activity and a deterioration in the 
outlook for commercial real estate in CB. 
The net addition also included $1.2 billion to establish 
the allowance for First Republic loans and lending-related 
commitments in the second quarter of 2023.
The provision in the prior year included a $3.5 billion net 
addition to the allowance for credit losses and net 
charge-offs of $2.9 billion.
• The total allowance for credit losses was $24.8 billion at 
December 31, 2023. The Firm had an allowance for loan 
losses to retained loans coverage ratio of 1.75%, 
compared with 1.81% in the prior year.
• The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $7.6 billion at 
December 31, 2023, up 5%, predominantly driven by 
wholesale nonaccrual loans, which reflected the impact of 
downgrades. Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio and 
Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 120–130 and pages 
114–119, respectively, for additional information.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

• Firmwide average loans of $1.2 trillion were up 13%, 
predominantly driven by higher loans in CCB and CB, 
primarily as a result of First Republic. 
• Firmwide average deposits of $2.4 trillion were down 
4%, driven by
– continued migration into higher-yielding investments in 
AWM, the impact of higher customer spending in CCB, 
continued deposit attrition in CB, and a net decline in 
CIB, which included actions taken to reduce certain 
deposits,
partially offset by
– the increase in deposits associated with First Republic, 
and growth related to the Firm’s international 
consumer initiatives in Corporate.
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 102–109 
for additional information.
Selected capital and other metrics
• CET1 capital was $251 billion, and the Standardized and 
Advanced CET1 ratios were both 15.0%.
• SLR was 6.1%.
• TBVPS grew 18%, ending 2023 at $86.08.
• As of December 31, 2023, the Firm had eligible end-ofperiod High Quality Liquid Assets (“HQLA”) of 
approximately $798 billion and unencumbered 
marketable securities with a fair value of approximately 
$649 billion, resulting in approximately $1.4 trillion of 
liquidity sources. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on 
pages 102–109 for additional information.
Refer to Consolidated Results of Operations and 
Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 54–57 and 
pages 58–60, respectively, for a further discussion of the 
Firm's results, including the provision for credit losses; and 
Business Segment Results on page 67 and Note 34 for 
additional information on the First Republic acquisition.
Pre-provision profit, ROTCE, TCE, TBVPS, NII and NIR 
excluding Markets, and total net revenue on a managed 
basis are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to 
Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of NonGAAP Financial Measures on pages 62–64 for a further

• On February 6, 2024, JPMorgan Chase announced that it 
plans to open more than 500 new branches, renovate 
approximately 1,700 locations and hire 3,500 employees

responsibilities for several key executives:
– Jennifer Piepszak, formerly the Co-Chief Executive 
Officer (“CEO”) of CCB, and Troy Rohrbaugh, formerly 
the Co-head of Markets and Securities Services, became 
Co-CEOs of the expanded Commercial & Investment 
Bank, which brings together the Firm’s major wholesale 
businesses consisting of Global Investment Banking, 
Commercial Banking and Corporate Banking, as well as 
Markets, Securities Services and Global Payments.
– Marianne Lake, the former Co-CEO of CCB, became the 
sole CEO of that business.

Outlook
These current expectations are forward-looking statements 
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform 
Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on 
the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s 
management, speak only as of the date of this Form 10-K, 
and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Refer to 
Forward-Looking Statements on page 161 and Part I, Item 
1A, Risk Factors section on pages 9-33 of this Form 10-K for 
a further discussion of certain of those risks and uncertainties 
and the other factors that could cause JPMorgan Chase’s 
actual results to differ materially because of those risks and 
uncertainties. There is no assurance that actual results in 
2024 will be in line with the outlook information set forth 
below, and the Firm does not undertake to update any 
forward-looking statements.
JPMorgan Chase’s current outlook for full-year 2024 should 
be viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S. 
economies, financial markets activity, the geopolitical 
environment, the competitive environment, client and 
customer activity levels, and regulatory and legislative 
developments in the U.S. and other countries where the 
Firm does business. Each of these factors will affect the 
performance of the Firm. The Firm will continue to make 
appropriate adjustments to its businesses and operations in 
response to ongoing developments in the business, 
economic, regulatory and legal environments in which it

Business Developments
First Republic acquisition
On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets 
and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank (the 
"First Republic acquisition") from the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), as receiver. 
JPMorgan Chase’s Consolidated Financial Statements as of 
and for the period ended December 31, 2023 reflect the 
impact of First Republic. Where meaningful to the 
disclosure, the impact of the First Republic acquisition, as 
well as subsequent related business and activities, are 
disclosed in various sections of this Form 10-K. The Firm 
continues to convert certain operations, and to integrate 
clients, products and services, associated with the First 
Republic acquisition to align with the Firm’s businesses and 
operations. 
Refer to Note 34 and page 67 for additional information 
related to First Republic.
Interbank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) transition 
The publication of the remaining principal tenors of U.S. 
dollar LIBOR (i.e., overnight, one-month, three-month, sixmonth and 12-month LIBOR) ceased on June 30, 2023 
(“LIBOR Cessation”). The one-month, three-month and sixmonth tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR will continue to be 
published on a "synthetic" basis, which will allow market 
participants to use such rates for certain legacy LIBORlinked contracts through September 30, 2024. 
As part of the Firm’s overall transition efforts which 
culminated in the second quarter of 2023, the Firm 
successfully completed the conversion of predominantly all 
of its remaining cleared derivatives contracts linked to U.S. 
dollar LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate 
(“SOFR”) as part of initiatives by the principal central 
counterparties (“CCPs”) to convert cleared derivatives prior 
to LIBOR Cessation. Nearly all of the Firm’s other U.S. dollar 
LIBOR-linked products that remained outstanding at LIBOR 
Cessation have been remediated through contractual 
fallback provisions or through the framework provided by 
the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (“LIBOR Act”). The 
Firm expects that the limited number of contracts 
remaining that reference “synthetic” U.S. dollar LIBOR will 
be remediated by September 30, 2024.

Republic acquisition. Refer to Business Segment Results on page 67, 
and Notes 6 and 34 for additional information.
2023 compared with 2022
Investment banking fees decreased, reflecting in CIB:
• lower advisory fees due to a lower number of completed 
transactions, reflecting the lower level of announced 
deals in the current and the prior year amid a challenging 
environment, and
• lower debt underwriting fees as challenging market 
conditions, primarily in the first half of the year, resulted 
in lower issuance activity across leveraged loans, 
investment-grade loans and high-grade bonds. This was 
largely offset by higher issuance activity in high-yield 
bonds driven by higher industry-wide issuance,
partially offset by
• higher equity underwriting fees driven by a higher level 
of follow-on offerings due to lower equity market 
volatility and a higher level of convertible securities 
offerings, which benefited from higher rates, partially 
offset by lower activity in private placements amid a 
challenging environment.
Refer to CIB segment results on pages 72–77 and Note 6 for 
additional information.
Principal transactions revenue increased, reflecting in CIB:
• higher Equity Markets principal transactions revenue in 
Prime Finance and Equity Derivatives, 
• higher Fixed Income Markets principal transactions 
revenue in Securitized Products and Fixed Income 
Financing, largely offset by lower revenue in Rates and 
Currencies & Emerging Markets;
– the net increase in Markets principal transactions 
revenue was more than offset by a decline in Markets 
net interest income, primarily due to higher funding 
costs; and
• losses of $280 million in Credit Adjustments & Other 
compared with $836 million in the prior year.
The prior year included net markdowns on held-for-sale 
positions, primarily unfunded commitments, in the bridge 
financing portfolio in CIB and CB.
The increase in principal transactions revenue also included 
the impact of higher short-term cash deployment activities 
in Treasury and CIO, reflective of the current interest rate 
environment.
Principal transactions revenue in CIB generally has offsets 
across other revenue lines, including net interest income. 
The Firm assesses the performance of its Markets business 
on a total net revenue basis.
Refer to CIB and Corporate segment results on pages 72–77 
and pages 84–85, respectively, and Note 6 for additional 
information.
Lending- and deposit-related fees increased, reflecting:
• higher lending-related revenue driven by the 
amortization of the purchase discount on certain acquired 
lending-related commitments associated with First 
Republic, primarily in AWM and CB,
predominantly offset by
• lower deposit-related fees in CB and CIB driven by the 
higher level of client credits that reduce such fees. 
Refer to CIB, CB and AWM segment results on pages 72–77, 
pages 78–80 and pages 81–83, respectively, and Note 6 for 
additional information.
Asset management fees increased driven by strong net 
inflows and the removal of most money market fund fee 
waivers in the prior year in AWM, and in CCB the impact of 
First Republic, as well as higher average market levels and 
strong net inflows. Refer to CCB and AWM segment results 
on pages 68–71 and pages 81–83, respectively, and Note 6 
for additional information. 

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

Commissions and other fees increased due to higher 
commissions on annuity sales and travel-related services in 
CCB. Refer to CCB segment results on pages 68–71 and 
Note 6 for additional information. 
Investment securities losses reflected higher net losses on 
higher sales of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. GSE and 
government agency MBS, associated with repositioning the 
investment securities portfolio in both periods in Treasury 
and CIO. Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 84–
85 and Note 10 for additional information.
Mortgage fees and related income: refer to CCB segment 
results on pages 68–71, Note 6 and 15 for further 
information.
Card income increased in CIB and CB, reflecting growth in 
merchant processing volume and Commercial Card 
transactions in J.P. Morgan Payments; and in CCB, driven by 
higher net interchange income on increased debit and 
credit card sales volume. Refer to Business Segment 
Results, CCB, CIB and CB segment results on pages 65–85, 
pages 68–71, pages 72–77 and pages 78–80, respectively, 
and Note 6 for further information.
Other income increased, reflecting: 
• the $2.8 billion estimated bargain purchase gain in 
Corporate associated with the First Republic acquisition,
• the impact of net investment hedges in Treasury and CIO, 
and
• a gain of $339 million recognized in the first quarter of 
2023 in AWM on the original minority interest in China 
International Fund Management (“CIFM”) upon the Firm's 
acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in the entity,
partially offset by
• lower auto operating lease income in CCB due to a decline 
in volume,
• lower net gains related to certain other Corporate 
investments, and
• the net impact of equity investments in CIB, including 
impairment losses in the second half of 2023,
The prior year included:
• a gain of $914 million on the sale of Visa B shares and 
proceeds from an insurance settlement in Corporate, and
• a gain on an equity-method investment received in partial 
satisfaction of a loan in CB.
Refer to Business Segment Results on page 67 and Note 34 
for additional information on the First Republic acquisition; 
Note 5 for additional information on net investment hedges; 
and Note 6 for further information.
Net interest income increased driven by higher rates, the 
impact of First Republic, and higher revolving balances in 
Card Services, partially offset by lower Markets net interest 
income and lower average deposit balances.
The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.3 
trillion, down $23 billion, and the yield was 5.14%, up 236 
basis points (“bps”). The net yield on these assets, on an 
FTE basis, was 2.70%, an increase of 70 bps. The net yield 
excluding Markets was 3.85%, up 125 bps.
Refer to the Consolidated average balance sheets, interest 
and rates schedule on pages 310-314 for further 
information. Net yield excluding Markets is a non-GAAP 
financial measure. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation 
of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 
62–64 for a further discussion of Net yield excluding 
Markets.

2023 compared with 2022
The provision for credit losses was $9.3 billion, reflecting 
$6.2 billion of net charge-offs and a net addition of $3.1 
billion to the allowance for credit losses. 
Net charge-offs increased $3.3 billion, consisting of $2.6 
billion in consumer, predominantly driven by Card Services, 
as the portfolio continued to normalize to pre-pandemic 
levels, and $698 million in wholesale.
The net addition to the allowance for credit losses included 
$1.9 billion, consisting of:
• $1.3 billion in consumer, predominantly driven by CCB, 
reflecting a $1.4 billion net addition in Card Services, 
partially offset by a net reduction of $200 million in 
Home Lending. The net addition in Card Services was 
driven by loan growth, including an increase in revolving 
balances, partially offset by reduced borrower 
uncertainty. The net reduction in Home Lending was 
driven by improvements in the outlook for home prices; 
and
• $657 million in wholesale, driven by net downgrade 
activity and the net effect of changes in the Firm's 
weighted average macroeconomic outlook, including a 
deterioration in the outlook for commercial real estate in 
CB, partially offset by the impact of changes in the loan 
and lending-related commitment portfolios.
The net addition also included $1.2 billion to establish the 
allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related 
commitments in the second quarter of 2023.
The provision in the prior year included a $3.5 billion net 
addition to the allowance for credit losses, consisting of 
$2.3 billion in wholesale and $1.2 billion in consumer, 
driven by loan growth and deterioration in the Firm’s 
macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reduction in 
the allowance related to a decrease in uncertainty 
associated with borrower behavior as the effects of the 
pandemic gradually receded, and net charge-offs of $2.9 
billion. 
Refer to the segment discussions of CCB on pages 68–71, 
CIB on pages 72–77, CB on pages 78–80, AWM on pages

individuals associated with First Republic who did not become 
employees of the Firm until July 2, 2023. Refer to Business Segment 
Results on page 67 for additional information.
2023 compared with 2022
Compensation expense increased driven by:
• an increase in employees, primarily in technology and 
front office, as well as wage inflation,
• the impact of First Republic in the second half of 2023, 
predominantly in CCB and Corporate, and
• higher volume- and revenue-related compensation 
predominantly in AWM and CCB.
Noncompensation expense increased as a result of:
• higher FDIC-related expense, which included the $2.9 
billion special assessment recognized in Corporate,
• the impact of First Republic in Corporate and CCB, 
• higher legal expense in CIB, Corporate and CCB,
• higher investments in the business, including marketing 
and technology, and
• higher other expenses, including higher indirect tax 
expense in CIB, and higher travel and entertainment

local taxes,
• lower benefits associated with tax audit settlements, and
• vesting of employee stock based awards,
largely offset by 
• the impact of the income tax expense associated with the 
First Republic acquisition that was reflected in the 
estimated bargain purchase gain, which resulted in a 
reduction in the Firm’s effective tax rate, and

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks 
increased reflecting the higher level of excess cash placed 
with the Federal Reserve Banks. The Firm’s excess cash 
primarily resulted from:
• the net issuance of long-term debt, and
• the impact of maturities and paydowns of investment 
securities in Treasury and CIO,
partially offset by
• the impacts associated with the First Republic acquisition 
in the first half of 2023.
Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale 
agreements decreased, reflecting a reduction in clientdriven market-making activities, partially offset by higher 
cash deployment in Treasury and CIO.
Securities borrowed increased driven by Markets, 
reflecting a higher demand for securities to cover short 
positions and client-driven activities.
Refer to Note 11 for additional information on securities 
purchased under resale agreements and securities 
borrowed.
Trading assets increased, reflecting in Markets higher debt 
and equity instruments on client-driven market-making 
activities, partially offset by lower derivative receivables, 
primarily as a result of market movements. Refer to Notes 2 
and 5 for additional information.
Investment securities decreased due to:
• lower available-for-sale ("AFS") securities driven by 
maturities and paydowns, predominantly offset by the 
impact of First Republic, net purchases, and the transfer 
of securities from held-to-maturity (“HTM”) in the first 
quarter of 2023, and
• lower HTM securities driven by maturities and paydowns, 
and the transfer of securities to AFS.
Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 84–85, 
Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 134 and 
Notes 2 and 10 for additional information on investment 
securities.
Loans increased, reflecting:
• $146 billion of loans associated with First Republic,
• growth in new accounts in Card Services, as well as higher 
revolving balances, which continued to normalize to prepandemic levels, and 
• growth in Auto loans due to net originations.
The allowance for loan losses increased, reflecting:
• a net addition to the allowance for loan losses of $2.2 
billion, consisting of:
– $1.3 billion in consumer, predominantly driven by CCB, 
reflecting $1.4 billion in Card Services driven by loan 
growth, including an increase in revolving balances, 
partially offset by a net reduction of $176 million in 
Home Lending, and
– $930 million in wholesale, driven by net downgrade 
activity and the net effect of changes in the Firm's 
weighted average macroeconomic outlook, and 
• $1.1 billion to establish the allowance for the First 
Republic loans in the second quarter of 2023.
The allowance for loan losses also reflected a reduction of 
$587 million, on January 1, 2023, as a result of the 
adoption of the Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: 
Troubled Debt Restructurings accounting guidance. 

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

References in this Form 10-K to "changes to the TDR 
accounting guidance" pertain to the Firm's adoption of this 
guidance.
There was also a $408 million net reduction in the 
allowance for lending-related commitments recognized in 
other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. 
Refer to Consolidated Results of Operations and Credit and 
Investment Risk Management on pages 54–57 and pages 
111–134, respectively, and Notes 2, 3, 12 and 13 for 
additional information on loans and the total allowance for 
credit losses; and Business Segment Results on page 67 and 
Note 34 for additional information on the First Republic 
acquisition. 
Accrued interest and accounts receivable decreased due 
to lower client receivables related to client-driven activities 
in Markets.
Premises and equipment increased as a result of the 
construction-in-process associated with the Firm's 
headquarters, the First Republic acquisition, largely lease 
right-of-use assets, and higher capitalized software. Refer 
to Note 16 and 18 for additional information.
Goodwill, MSRs and other intangibles increased 
predominantly due to: 
• other intangibles and goodwill related to the acquisition 
of the remaining 51% interest in CIFM, 
• core deposit intangibles associated with the First 
Republic acquisition, and
• higher MSRs as a result of net additions primarily from 
purchases, and the impact of higher interest rates, 
partially offset by the realization of expected cash flows.
Refer to Note 15 and 34 for additional information.
Other assets decreased reflecting the impact of the change 
in the type of collateral placed with CCPs from cash to 
securities.

Deposits increased, reflecting the net impact of:
• higher balances in CIB due to net issuances of structured 
notes as a result of client demand, as well as deposit 
inflows from client-driven activities in Payments and 
Securities Services, partially offset by deposit attrition, 
including actions taken to reduce certain deposits,
• growth in Corporate related to the Firm's international 
consumer initiatives,
• lower balances in CCB reflecting higher customer 
spending,
• a decline in AWM due to continued migration into higheryielding investments driven by the higher interest rate 
environment, predominantly offset by growth from new 
and existing customers as a result of new product 
offerings, and
• a decrease in CB due to continued deposit attrition as 
clients seek higher-yielding investments, predominantly 
offset by the retention of inflows associated with 
disruptions in the market in the first quarter of 2023.
The net increase also included $61 billion of deposits 
associated with First Republic, primarily reflected in CCB, 
AWM and CB.
Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold 
under repurchase agreements increased, reflecting the 
impact of a lower level of netting on reduced repurchase 
activity.
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 102–109 for 
additional information on deposits, federal funds purchased 
and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, 
and short-term borrowings; Notes 2 and 17 for deposits 
and Note 11 for federal funds purchased and securities 
loaned or sold under repurchase agreements; Business 
Segment Results on page 67 and Note 34 for additional 
information on the First Republic acquisition.
Trading liabilities increased due to client-driven marketmaking activities in Fixed Income Markets, which resulted in 
higher levels of short positions in debt instruments, 
partially offset by lower derivative payables primarily as a 
result of market movements. Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for 
additional information.
Accounts payable and other liabilities decreased primarily 
due to lower client payables related to client-driven 
activities in Markets, partially offset by higher accounts 
payable and accrued liabilities, including the $2.9 billion 
payable related to the FDIC special assessment. Refer to 
Note 19 for additional information.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs increased 
in CIB primarily driven by higher levels of Firmadministered multi-seller conduit commercial paper held by 
third parties, reflecting changes in the Firm’s short-term 
liquidity management. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management 
on pages 102–109; and Notes 14 and 28 for additional 
information on Firm-sponsored VIEs and loan securitization 
trusts.
Long-term debt increased, reflecting the impact of First 
Republic, which included the Purchase Money Note issued 
to the FDIC and additional FHLB advances, as well as net 
issuance consistent with the Firm’s long-term funding plans. 
The increase was also attributable to net issuances of 
structured notes in Markets due to client demand and an 
increase in fair value. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management 
on pages 102–109 and Note 34 for additional information 
on the First Republic acquisition.
Stockholders’ equity: refer to Consolidated Statements of

Operating activities 
JPMorgan Chase’s operating assets and liabilities primarily 
support the Firm’s lending and capital markets activities. 
These assets and liabilities can vary significantly in the 
normal course of business due to the amount and timing of 
cash flows, which are affected by client-driven and risk 
management activities and market conditions. The Firm 
believes that cash flows from operations, available cash and 
other liquidity sources, and its capacity to generate cash 
through secured and unsecured sources, are sufficient to 
meet its operating liquidity needs.
• In 2023, cash provided primarily reflected net income, 
lower other assets, and accrued interest and accounts 
receivable, predominantly offset by higher trading assets, 
lower accounts payable and other liabilities, and higher 
securities borrowed. 
• In 2022, cash provided resulted from higher accounts 
payable and other liabilities, lower securities borrowed, 
and net proceeds from sales, securitizations, and 
paydowns of loans held-for-sale, partially offset by higher 
trading assets.
Investing activities
The Firm’s investing activities predominantly include 
originating held-for-investment loans, investing in the 
investment securities portfolio and other short-term 
instruments.
• In 2023, cash provided resulted from net proceeds from 
investment securities, proceeds from sales and 
securitizations of loans held-for-investment and lower 
securities purchased under resale agreements, largely 
offset by net originations of loans and net cash used in 
the First Republic Bank acquisition.
• In 2022, cash used resulted from net originations of 
loans and higher securities purchased under resale 
agreements, partially offset by net proceeds from 
investment securities.
Financing activities
The Firm’s financing activities include acquiring customer 
deposits and issuing long-term debt and preferred stock.
• In 2023, cash used reflected lower deposits, which 
included the impact of the repayment of the deposits 
provided to First Republic Bank by the consortium of 
large U.S. banks that the Firm assumed as part of the 
First Republic acquisition, partially offset by higher 
securities loaned under repurchase agreements and net 
proceeds from long- and short-term borrowings.
• In 2022, cash used reflected lower deposits, partially 
offset by net proceeds from long- and short-term 
borrowings.
• For both periods, cash was used for repurchases of 
common stock and cash dividends on common and 
preferred stock.

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Non-GAAP financial measures
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in 
accordance with U.S. GAAP; these financial statements 
appear on pages 166–170. That presentation, which is 
referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an 
understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked 
consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of 
the Firm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial 
statements of other companies.
In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported 
basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the 
overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide 
managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. 
The Firm also reviews the results of the LOBs on a managed 
basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each 
case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes 
certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the 
Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an 
FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that 
receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in 
the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable 
investments and securities. These financial measures allow 
management to assess the comparability of revenue from 
year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt 
sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to 
tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. 
These adjustments have no impact on net income as 
reported by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs.
Management also uses certain non-GAAP financial 
measures at the Firm and business-segment level because 
these other non-GAAP financial measures provide 
information to investors about the underlying operational 
performance and trends of the Firm or of the particular 
business segment, as the case may be, and therefore 
facilitate a comparison of the Firm or the business segment 
with the performance of its relevant competitors. Refer to 
Business Segment Results on pages 65–85 for additional 
information on these non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP 
financial measures used by the Firm may not be 
comparable to similarly named non-GAAP financial 
measures used by other companies. 
The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm’s reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.

Net interest income, net yield, and noninterest revenue 
excluding Markets
In addition to reviewing net interest income, net yield, and 
noninterest revenue on a managed basis, management also 
reviews these metrics excluding Markets, as shown below. 
Markets consists of CIB’s Fixed Income Markets and Equity 
Markets. These metrics, which exclude Markets, are nonGAAP financial measures. Management reviews these 
metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, 
investing (including asset-liability management) and 
deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility 
associated with Markets activities. In addition, management 
also assesses Markets business performance on a total 
revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. 
Management believes that these measures provide 
investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze 
the revenue trends of the Firm.

Calculation of certain U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures
Certain U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are calculated as 
follows:
Book value per share (“BVPS”)
Common stockholders’ equity at period-end / Common shares at period-end 
Overhead ratio
Total noninterest expense / Total net revenue
ROA
Reported net income / Total average assets
ROE
Net income* / Average common stockholders’ equity
ROTCE
Net income* / Average tangible common equity
TBVPS
Tangible common equity at period-end / Common shares at period-end
* Represents net income applicable to common equity
In addition, the Firm reviews other non-GAAP measures 
such as:
• Adjusted expense, which represents noninterest expense 
excluding Firmwide legal expense, and
• Pre-provision profit, which represents total net revenue 
less total noninterest expense.
Management believes that these measures help investors 
understand the effect of these items on reported results 
and provide an alternative presentation of the Firm’s 
performance.
The Firm also reviews the allowance for loan losses to 
period-end loans retained excluding trade finance and 
conduits, a non-GAAP financial measure, to provide a more 
meaningful assessment of CIB’s allowance coverage ratio.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS
TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., 
total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related 
deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. 
TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by 
the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity. 
The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity to TCE.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major reportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking, 
Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate 
segment. 
The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they 
reflect the manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are 
presented on a managed basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, on 
pages 62–64 for a definition of managed basis.

(a) As a result of the organizational changes that were announced on January 25, 2024, the Firm will be reorganizing its business segments to reflect the 
manner in which the segments will be managed. The reorganization of the business segments is expected to be effective in the second quarter of 2024. 
Refer to Recent events on page 52 for additional information.
Description of business segment reporting methodology 
Results of the business segments are intended to present 
each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The 
management reporting process that derives business 
segment results includes the allocation of certain income 
and expense items. The Firm periodically assesses the 
assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications 
used for segment reporting, and therefore further 
refinements may be implemented in future periods. The 
Firm also assesses the level of capital required for each LOB 
on at least an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide 
various business metrics which are utilized by the Firm and 
its investors and analysts in assessing performance.
Revenue sharing 
When business segments join efforts to sell products and 
services to the Firm’s clients and customers, the 
participating business segments may agree to share 
revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally 
recognized in the segment responsible for the related 
product or service, with allocations to the other segment(s) 
involved in the transaction. The segment results reflect 
these revenue-sharing agreements.
Expense allocation
Where business segments use services provided by 
corporate support units, or another business segment, the 
costs of those services are allocated to the respective 
business segments. The expense is generally 
allocated based on the actual cost and use of services 
provided. In contrast, certain costs and investments related 
to corporate support units, technology and operations that 
are not currently utilized by any LOB are not allocated to 
the business segments and are retained in Corporate. 
Expense retained in Corporate generally includes costs that 
would not be incurred if the segments were stand-alone 
businesses, and other items not solely aligned with a 
particular business segment.
Funds transfer pricing 
Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which the 
Firm allocates interest income and expense to the LOBs and 
Other Corporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk 
and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO.
The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest 
rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities 
and off-balance sheet products. Periodically, the 
methodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP process 
are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other 
factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest 
income to the segments.
As a result of the higher interest rate environment, the cost 
of funds for assets and the credits earned for liabilities have 
generally increased, impacting the business segments’ net 
interest income. During the period ended December 31, 
2023, this has resulted in higher cost of funds for loans and 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

Markets activities, and contributed to margin expansion on 
deposits.
Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and 
Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain revenues 
and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these risks 
centrally and reports the impact of foreign exchange rate 
movements related to the transferred risk in its results. 
Refer to Market Risk Management on page 143 for 
additional information.
Debt expense and preferred stock dividend allocation
As part of the funds transfer pricing process, almost all of 
the cost of the credit spread component of outstanding 
unsecured long-term debt and preferred stock dividends is 
allocated to the reportable business segments, while the 
balance of the cost is retained in Corporate. The 
methodology to allocate the cost of unsecured long-term 
debt and preferred stock dividends to the business 
segments is aligned with the relevant regulatory capital 
requirements and funding needs of the LOBs, as applicable. 
The allocated cost of unsecured long-term debt is included 
in a business segment’s net interest income, and net income 
is reduced by preferred stock dividends, to arrive at a 
business segment’s net income applicable to common 
equity. 
Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 91-101 for 
additional information.
Capital allocation 
The amount of capital assigned to each business segment is 
referred to as equity. The Firm’s current allocation 
methodology incorporates Basel III Standardized riskweighted assets (“RWA”) and the global systemically 
important banks (“GSIB”) surcharge, both under rules 
currently in effect, as well as a simulation of capital in a 
severe stress environment. At least annually, the 
assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to 
allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital 
allocated to the LOBs may change.
Refer to Line of business equity on page 98 for additional 
information on capital allocation.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

2023 compared with 2022
Net income was $21.2 billion, up 42%.
Net revenue was $70.1 billion, up 28%.
Net interest income was $55.0 billion, up 38%, driven by:
• deposit margin expansion on higher rates, partially offset 
by lower average deposits and the impact of lower PPP 
loan forgiveness in Banking & Wealth Management 
(“BWM”), 
• higher Card Services NII, reflecting an increase in 
revolving balances, and 
• the impact of First Republic in Home Lending.
Noninterest revenue was $15.1 billion, up 2%, driven by:
• higher asset management fees due to the impact of First 
Republic as well as higher market levels and strong net 
inflows, higher commissions on annuity sales in BWM and 
higher other service fees associated with First Republic,
• higher net interchange income on increased debit and 
credit card sales volume, and 
– In Card Services, higher annual fees and the higher net 
interchange income were more than offset by an 
increase in amortization related to new account 
origination costs, reflecting continued growth. Net 
interchange income in Card Services also reflected the 
impact of a reduction in rewards costs and partner 
payments in the first quarter of 2023 related to a 
periodic tax refund on airline miles redeemed and an 
increase to the rewards liability due to adjustments to 
certain reward program terms in the second quarter of 
2023;
• higher travel-related commissions in Card Services, 
predominantly offset by
• lower auto operating lease income as a result of a decline 
in volume, and
• lower mortgage fees and related income in Home 
Lending.
Refer to Note 6 for additional information on card income,
asset management fees, and commissions and other fees; 
and Critical Accounting Estimates on pages 155–158 for 
credit card rewards liability. 
Refer to Note 15 for further information regarding changes 
in the value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and 
mortgage fees and related income.
Refer to Note 34 for additional information on the First 
Republic acquisition.
Noninterest expense was $34.8 billion, up 12%, reflecting:
• higher compensation expense, driven by an increase in 
employees, including the impact of First Republic in the 
second half of 2023 and additions primarily in bankers, 
advisors and technology, wage inflation and higher 
revenue-related compensation, as well as 
• higher noncompensation expense, driven by the impact of 
First Republic, investments in marketing and technology, 
the increase in the FDIC assessment announced in the 
prior year as well as higher legal expense, partially offset 
by lower auto lease depreciation on lower auto lease 
assets.
The provision for credit losses was $6.9 billion, reflecting:
• net charge-offs of $5.3 billion, up $2.6 billion, 
predominantly driven by Card Services, as the portfolio 
continued to normalize to pre-pandemic levels,
• a $1.2 billion net addition to the allowance for credit 
losses, which included $1.4 billion in Card Services, 
partially offset by a net reduction of $200 million in 
Home Lending. The net addition in Card Services was 
driven by loan growth, including an increase in revolving 
balances, partially offset by reduced borrower 
uncertainty. The net reduction in Home Lending was 
driven by improvements in the outlook for home prices; 
and 
• $408 million to establish the allowance for the First 
Republic loans and lending-related commitments in the 
second quarter of 2023.
The provision in the prior year was $3.8 billion, driven by 
net charge-offs of $2.7 billion and a $1.1 billion net 
addition to the allowance for credit losses across CCB.
Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 
111–134 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 131–
133 for a further discussion of the credit portfolios and the 
allowance for credit losses.

(a) At December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, nonaccrual loans excluded 
mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. 
government agencies of $123 million, $187 million and $342 million, 
respectively. These amounts have been excluded based upon the 
government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to 
exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as 
permitted by regulatory guidance.
(b) At December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, generally excludes loans that 
were under payment deferral programs offered in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic.
(c) At December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, included $94 million, $350 
million and $5.4 billion of loans, respectively, in Business Banking 
under the PPP. The Firm does not expect to realize material credit 
losses on PPP loans because the loans are guaranteed by the SBA.
(d) At December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the principal balance of loans 
under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic was $29 million, $449 million and $1.1 billion in Home

modified terms are generally not considered delinquent.
(e) At December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, excluded mortgage loans 
insured by U.S. government agencies of $176 million, $258 million and 
$405 million, respectively, that are 30 or more days past due. These 
amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee. 
(f) Includes First Republic. 
(g) On January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted changes to the TDR accounting 
guidance. The adoption of this guidance resulted in a net decrease in 
the allowance for loan losses of $591 million, driven by residential real 
estate and credit card. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

2023 compared with 2022
Net income was $14.1 billion, down 5%.
Net revenue was $48.8 billion, up 1%.
Banking revenue was $16.5 billion, up 7%.
• Investment Banking revenue was $6.2 billion, down 4%. 
Excluding $257 million of markdowns on held-for-sale 
positions, primarily unfunded commitments, in the bridge 
financing portfolio recorded in the second quarter of 
2022, Investment Banking revenue was down 8%. 
Investment Banking fees were down 5%, driven by lower 
advisory and debt underwriting fees, partially offset by 
higher equity underwriting fees. The Firm ranked #1 for 
Global Investment Banking fees, according to Dealogic.
– Advisory fees were $2.8 billion, down 8%, due to a 
lower number of completed transactions, reflecting the 
lower level of announced deals in the current and the 
prior year amid a challenging environment. 
– Debt underwriting fees were $2.6 billion, down 8%, as 
challenging market conditions, primarily in the first 
half of the year, resulted in lower issuance activity 
across leveraged loans, investment-grade loans, and 
high-grade bonds. This was largely offset by higher 
issuance activity in high-yield bonds driven by higher 
industry-wide issuance.
– Equity underwriting fees were $1.2 billion, up 11%, 
driven by a higher level of follow-on offerings due to 
lower equity market volatility and a higher level of 
convertible securities offerings which benefited from 
higher rates, partially offset by lower activity in private 
placements amid a challenging environment.
• Payments revenue was $9.3 billion, up 22%, driven by 
deposit margin expansion on higher rates and fees, 
partially offset by the higher level of client credits that 
reduce such fees and lower average deposits. The net 
impact of equity investments was flat reflecting net 
markdowns in both periods, including the impact of an 
impairment in the current year.
• Lending revenue was $1.0 billion, down 27%, driven by 
$494 million of fair value losses on hedges of retained 
loans which included an increase in hedging activity, 
compared to $27 million of gains in the prior year, 
partially offset by higher net interest income.
Markets & Securities Services revenue was $32.3 billion, 
down 1%. Markets revenue was $27.8 billion, down 4%.
• Fixed Income Markets revenue was $18.8 billion, up 1%, 
driven by an increase in finance and trading activity in the 
Securitized Products Group and improved performance in 
Credit Trading, predominantly offset by lower revenue in 
Currencies & Emerging Markets as the business 
substantially normalized from the prior year’s elevated 
levels of volatility and client activity.
• Equity Markets revenue was $9.0 billion, down 13%, 
driven by lower revenue in Equity Derivatives and Cash 
Equities, compared with a stronger performance in the 
prior year.
• Securities Services revenue was $4.8 billion, up 6%, 
driven by deposit margin expansion on higher rates, 
largely offset by lower average deposits and fees.
• Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $280 million, 
compared with a loss of $836 million in the prior year.
Noninterest expense was $28.6 billion, up 5%, driven by 
higher legal expense, compensation expense, including the 
impact of wage inflation, and higher indirect tax expense.
The provision for credit losses was $121 million, driven by 
net charge-offs of $272 million, up $190 million, driven by 
single name exposures, largely offset by a $151 million net 
reduction in the allowance for credit losses.
The net reduction in the allowance was driven by the impact 
of changes in the loan and lending-related commitment 
portfolios and the net effect of changes in the Firm’s 
weighted average macroeconomic outlook, predominantly 
offset by an addition for certain accounts receivable and net 
downgrade activity.
The provision in the prior year was $1.2 billion, 
predominantly driven by a net addition to the allowance for 
credit losses.

Markets revenue
The following table summarizes selected income statement 
data for the Markets businesses. Markets includes both 
Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue 
consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and 
other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm 
assesses its Markets business performance on a total 
revenue basis, as offsets generally occur across revenue 
line items. For example, securities that generate net 
interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that 
are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. 
Refer to Notes 6 and 7 for a description of the composition 
of these income statement line items. 
Principal transactions reflects revenue on financial 
instruments and commodities transactions that arise from 
client-driven market-making activity. Principal transactions 
revenue includes amounts recognized upon executing new 
transactions with market participants, as well as “inventoryrelated revenue”, which is revenue recognized from gains 
and losses on derivatives and other instruments that the 
Firm has been holding in anticipation of, or in response to, 
client demand, and changes in the fair value of instruments 
used by the Firm to actively manage the risk exposure 
arising from such inventory. Principal transactions revenue 
recognized upon executing new transactions with market 
participants is affected by many factors including the level 
of client activity, the bid-offer spread (which is the 
difference between the price at which a market participant 
is willing and able to sell an instrument to the Firm and the 
price at which another market participant is willing and able 
to buy it from the Firm, and vice versa), market liquidity 
and volatility. These factors are interrelated and sensitive 
to the same factors that drive inventory-related revenue, 
which include general market conditions, such as interest 
rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and equity 
and commodity prices, as well as other macroeconomic 
conditions.

(a) Total net revenue included tax-equivalent adjustments from income 
tax credits related to equity investments in designated community 
development entities and in entities established for rehabilitation of 
historic properties, as well as tax-exempt income related to municipal 
financing activities of $382 million, $322 million and $330 million for 
the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
(b) Includes First Republic. Refer to page 67 for additional information.
2023 compared with 2022 
Net income was $6.1 billion, up 46%.
Net revenue was $15.5 billion, up 35%. 
Net interest income was $12.1 billion, up 47%, driven by: 
• deposit margin expansion on higher rates, partially offset 
by lower average deposits, and
• higher average loans, including the impact from First 
Republic.
Noninterest revenue was $3.5 billion, up 5%, driven by: 
• higher lending-related revenue predominantly driven by 
the amortization of the purchase discount on certain 
acquired lending-related commitments associated with 
First Republic, 
• net markups on held-for-sale positions, primarily 
unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio, 
compared with net markdowns in the prior year, and
• higher investment banking revenue and card income,
predominantly offset by 
• lower deposit-related fees due to the higher level of client 
credits that reduce such fees, and
• the absence of a gain on an equity-method investment 
received in partial satisfaction of a loan.
Noninterest expense was $5.4 billion, up 14%, driven by 
higher compensation expense, reflecting an increase in 
employees including front office and technology, as well as 
higher volume-related expense, including the impact of new 
client acquisitions.
The provision for credit losses was $2.0 billion, reflecting:
• a $1.0 billion net addition to the allowance for credit 
losses, driven by the net effect of changes in the Firm’s 
weighted average macroeconomic outlook, including a 
deterioration in the outlook for commercial real estate 
and net downgrade activity, partially offset by the impact 
of changes in the loan and lending-related commitment 
portfolios,
• $608 million to establish the allowance for the First 
Republic loans and lending-related commitments in the 
second quarter of 2023; and
• net charge-offs of $316 million, up $232 million, 
primarily driven by Real Estate, predominantly 
concentrated in Office. 
The provision in the prior year was $1.3 billion, reflecting a 
net addition to the allowance for credit losses.

(a) Includes the amortization of the purchase discount on certain acquired 
lending-related commitments associated with First Republic. The 
discount is deferred in other liabilities and recognized on a straightline basis over the commitment period and was largely recognized in 
the current year as the commitments are generally short term. Refer 
to Note 34 for additional information. 
(b) Includes the gain on the original minority interest in CIFM upon the 
Firm’s acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in the entity.
2023 compared with 2022 
Net income was $5.2 billion, up 20%.
Net revenue was $19.8 billion, up 12%. Net interest 
income was $6.3 billion, up 20%. Noninterest revenue was 
$13.6 billion, up 8%.
Revenue from Asset Management was $9.1 billion, up 4%, 
driven by: 
• a gain of $339 million on the original minority interest in 
CIFM upon the Firm's acquisition of the remaining 51% 
interest in the entity, and
• higher asset management fees driven by strong net 
inflows largely offset by the net impact of foreign 
exchange rate movements, as well as the removal of most 
money market fund fee waivers in the prior year,
largely offset by
• lower performance fees, and
• lower NII due to higher funding costs.
Revenue from Global Private Bank was $10.7 billion, up 
20%, driven by: 
• higher net interest income on higher average loans 
associated with First Republic, and from deposit margin 
expansion on higher rates, largely offset by lower 
average deposits, and 
• higher noninterest revenue, predominantly driven by the 
amortization of the purchase discount on certain acquired 
lending-related commitments associated with First 
Republic, partially offset by net investment valuation 
losses.
Noninterest expense was $12.8 billion, up 8%, 
predominantly driven by higher compensation, including 
continued growth in private banking advisor teams, 
revenue-related compensation and the impacts of closing 
the Global Shares and J.P. Morgan Asset Management China 
acquisitions.
The provision for credit losses was $159 million, 
predominantly driven by a $146 million addition to the 
allowance for credit losses to establish the allowance for 
the First Republic loans and lending-related commitments 
in the second quarter of 2023. 
The provision in the prior year was $128 million driven by a 
net addition to the allowance for credit losses.

Asset Management has two high-level measures of its 
overall fund performance.
• Percentage of active mutual fund and active ETF assets under 
management in funds rated 4- or 5-star: Mutual fund rating services 
rank funds based on their risk adjusted performance over various 
periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and represents the top 10% 
of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star rating represents the next 
22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the 
next 35% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents 
the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the 
worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of industrywide ranked 
funds. An overall Morningstar rating is derived from a weighted 
average of the performance associated with a fund’s three-, five and 
ten- year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-
domiciled funds, separate star ratings are provided at the individual 
share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on three-year 
risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of 
history are not rated and hence excluded from these rankings. All 
ratings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to 
derive these rankings are sourced from the applicable fund rating 
provider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate 
asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on star 
ratings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a 
“primary share class” level to represent the star rating of all other 
funds, except for Japan, for which Nomura provides ratings at the 
fund level. The performance data may have been different if all share 
classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of 
future results.
• Percentage of active mutual fund and active ETF assets under 
management in funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three 
and five years):All quartile rankings, the assigned peer categories and 
the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced from the 
fund rating providers. Quartile rankings are based on the net-of-fee 
absolute return of each fund. Where applicable, the fund rating 
providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage 
of AUM is based on fund performance and associated peer rankings at 
the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, at a “primary share 
class” level to represent the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg 
and Hong Kong SAR funds and at the fund level for all other funds. 
The performance data may have been different if all share classes had 
been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results.
“Primary share class” means the C share class for European funds and 
Acc share class for Hong Kong SAR and Taiwan funds. If these share 
classes are not available, the oldest share class is used as the primary 
share class.

(a) Included tax-equivalent adjustments, predominantly driven by taxexempt income from municipal bonds, of $211 million, $235 million 
and $257 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 
2021, respectively. 
(b) Predominantly relates to the Firm's international consumer initiatives.
(c) Includes the impact of the First Republic acquisition. Refer to Notes 6 
and 34 for additional information.
(d) Includes the FDIC special assessment. Refer to Note 6 for additional 
information.
(e) Income taxes associated with the First Republic acquisition are 
reflected in the estimated bargain purchase gain.
2023 compared with 2022
Net income was $2.8 billion, compared with a net loss of 
$743 million in the prior year.
Net revenue was $8.0 billion, compared with $80 million in 
the prior year, predominantly driven by higher net interest 
income due to higher rates, partially offset by the impact of 
lower Firmwide average deposit balances.
Noninterest revenue was $132 million, compared with a 
loss of $1.8 billion in the prior year, driven by: 
• the $2.8 billion estimated bargain purchase gain 
associated with the First Republic acquisition, 
• higher losses in the prior year on certain revenues 
associated with foreign exchange rate movements that 
are risk-managed by Treasury and CIO, and
• the impact of higher short-term cash deployment 
activities as a result of the current interest rate 
environment,
partially offset by 
• higher net investment securities losses related to the 
sales of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. GSE and government 
agency MBS, associated with repositioning the investment 
securities portfolio, and
• lower net gains related to certain other Corporate 
investments.
The prior year included a gain on the sale of Visa B shares 
and proceeds from an insurance settlement.
Noninterest expense was $5.6 billion, up $4.6 billion, 
predominantly driven by: 
• the $2.9 billion FDIC special assessment,
• $1.0 billion associated with First Republic, predominantly 
driven by integration and restructuring costs as well as 
expenses recorded in the second quarter of 2023 with 
respect to individuals associated with First Republic who 
did not become employees of the Firm until July 2, 2023, 
• a greater benefit in the prior year on certain expenses 
associated with foreign exchange rate movements that 
are risk-managed by Treasury and CIO,
• higher legal expenses, and
• higher costs associated with the Firm's international 
consumer growth initiatives, 
partially offset by
• lower benefits-related and real estate expenses.
The net impact of movements in foreign exchange rates 
associated with the foreign exchange risk that was 
transferred to Treasury and CIO on certain revenues and 
expenses was not material to net income. Refer to Foreign 
Exchange Risk on page 66 for additional information.
Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for additional information on 
the investment securities portfolio and the allowance for 
credit losses.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

The provision for credit losses was $171 million, reflecting 
a net addition to the allowance for credit losses related to a 
single name exposure, which was subsequently charged off 
upon the restructuring of a loan.
The current period income tax benefit was driven by:
• the finalization of certain income tax regulations, other 
tax adjustments and tax benefits associated with tax audit 
settlements,
partially offset by
• the impact from changes in the level and mix of income 
and expenses subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes 
that also impacted the Firm's tax reserves. 
The income taxes associated with the First Republic 
acquisition are reflected in the estimated bargain purchase 
gain.
The prior period income tax benefit was driven by benefits 
related to tax audit settlements as well as other tax 
adjustments, partially offset by a change in the level and 
mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal, state 
and local taxes that also impacted the Firm's tax reserves.
Other Corporate also reflects the Firm's international 
consumer initiatives, which includes Chase U.K., the Firm's 
digital retail bank in the U.K.; Nutmeg, a digital wealth 
manager in the U.K.; and a 46% ownership stake in C6 
Bank, a digital bank in Brazil.
Treasury and CIO overview 
Treasury and CIO is predominantly responsible for 
measuring, monitoring, reporting and managing the Firm’s 
liquidity, funding, capital, structural interest rate and 
foreign exchange risks. The risks managed by Treasury and 
CIO arise from the activities undertaken by the Firm’s four 
major reportable business segments to serve their 
respective client bases, which generate both on- and offbalance sheet assets and liabilities.
Treasury and CIO seeks to achieve the Firm’s asset-liability 
management objectives generally by investing in highquality securities that are managed for the longer-term as 
part of the Firm’s investment securities portfolio. Treasury 
and CIO also uses derivatives to meet the Firm’s assetliability management objectives. Refer to Note 5 for further 
information on derivatives. In addition, Treasury and CIO 
manages the Firm’s cash position primarily through 
deposits at central banks and investments in short-term 
instruments. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 
102–109 for further information on liquidity and funding 
risk. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 135–143 
for information on interest rate and foreign exchange risks.
The investment securities portfolio predominantly consists 
of U.S. and non-U.S. government securities, U.S. GSE and 
government agency and nonagency mortgage-backed 
securities, collateralized loan obligations, obligations of U.S. 
states and municipalities and other ABS. At December 31, 
2023, the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, 
net of the allowance for credit losses, was $569.2 billion, 
and the average credit rating of the securities comprising 
the portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where 
available and, where not available, based primarily upon 
internal risk ratings). Refer to Note 10 for further 
information on the Firm’s investment securities portfolio 
and internal risk ratings.

FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business 
activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale 
loan, advises customers and clients on their investment 
decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other 
products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. 
The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its business, and 
the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the 
interests of its clients, customers and investors, and 
protecting the safety and soundness of the Firm. 
The Firm believes that effective risk management requires, 
among other things: 
• Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and 
escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm; 
• Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and 
management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and 
• A Firmwide risk governance and oversight structure.
The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation 
framework with strong internal governance and 
independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the 
“Board”). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully 
considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and 
incentive compensation processes. 
Risk governance framework
The Firm’s risk governance framework involves 
understanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and impacts of 
risks. 
Drivers of risks are factors that cause a risk to exist. Drivers 
of risks include, but are not limited to, the economic 
environment, regulatory or government policy, competitor 
or market evolution, business decisions, process or 
judgment error, deliberate wrongdoing, dysfunctional 
markets, and natural disasters.
Types of risks are categories by which risks manifest 
themselves. The Firm’s risks are generally categorized in 
the following four risk types: 
Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity, or 
reputation associated with poorly designed or failed 
business plans or an inadequate response to changes in 
the operating environment. 
Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the 
default or change in credit profile of a client, 
counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a 
reduction in expected returns on investments, including 
consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and 
investment portfolio risk. 
• Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of 
changes in market factors, such as interest and foreign 
exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit 
spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and 
liabilities held for both the short and long term. 
• Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome 
resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or 
systems; human factors; or external events impacting the 
Firm’s processes or systems. Operational risk includes 
cybersecurity, compliance, conduct, legal, and 
estimations and model risk.
Impacts of risks are consequences of risks, both quantitative 
and qualitative. There may be many consequences of risks 
manifesting, including quantitative impacts such as a 
reduction in earnings and capital, liquidity outflows, and 
fines or penalties, or qualitative impacts such as damage to 
the Firm’s reputation, loss of clients and customers, and 
regulatory and enforcement actions.
The Firm’s risk governance framework is managed on a 
Firmwide basis. The Firm has an Independent Risk 
Management (“IRM”) function, which is comprised of Risk 
Management and Compliance. The Firm’s Chief Executive 
Officer (“CEO”) appoints, subject to approval by the Risk 
Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Board Risk 
Committee”), the Firm’s Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”) to lead 
the IRM function and maintain the risk governance 
framework of the Firm. The framework is subject to 
approval by the Board Risk Committee through its review 
and approval of the Risk Governance and Oversight Policy. 
The Firm’s CRO oversees and delegates authority to the 
Firmwide Risk Executives (“FREs”), the Chief Risk Officers of 
the LOBs and Corporate (“LOB CROs”), and the Firm’s Chief 
Compliance Officer (“CCO”), who, in turn, establish Risk 
Management and Compliance organizations, develop the 
Firm’s risk governance policies and standards, and define 
and oversee the implementation of the Firm’s risk 
governance framework. The LOB CROs oversee risks that 
arise in their LOBs and Corporate, while FREs oversee risks 
that span across the LOBs and Corporate, as well as 
functions and regions. Each area of the Firm giving rise to 
risk is expected to operate within the parameters identified 
by the IRM function, and within the risk and control 
standards established by its own management. 
Three lines of defense
The Firm’s “three lines of defense” are as follows: 
The first line of defense consists of each LOB, Treasury and 
CIO, and certain Other Corporate initiatives, including their 
aligned Operations, Technology and Control Management. 
The first line of defense owns the identification of risks 
within their respective organizations and the design and 
execution of controls to manage those risks. 
Responsibilities also include adherence to applicable laws, 
rules and regulations and implementation of the risk 
Management’s discussion and analysis

governance framework established by IRM, which may

The second line of defense is the IRM function, which is 
separate from the first line of defense and is responsible for 
independently measuring risk, as well as assessing and 
challenging the risk management practices of the first line 
of defense. IRM is also responsible for the identification of 
risks within its respective organization, adherence to 
applicable laws, rules and regulations and for the 
development and implementation of policies and standards 
with respect to its own processes. 
The third line of defense is Internal Audit, an independent 
function that provides objective assessment of the 
adequacy and effectiveness of Firmwide processes, 
controls, governance and risk management. The Internal 
Audit function is headed by the General Auditor, who 
reports to the Audit Committee and administratively to the 
CEO.
In addition, there are other functions that contribute to the 
Firmwide control environment but are not considered part 
of a particular line of defense, including Finance, Human 
Resources and Legal. These other functions are responsible 
for the identification of risks within their respective 
organizations, adherence to applicable laws, rules and 
regulations and implementation of the risk governance 
framework established by IRM.
Risk identification and ownership
The LOBs and Corporate own the identification of risks 
within their respective organizations, as well as the design 
and execution of controls, including IRM-specified controls, 
to manage those risks. To support this activity, the Firm has 
a risk identification framework designed to facilitate each 
LOB and Corporate’s responsibility to identify material risks 
inherent to the Firm’s businesses and operational activities, 
catalog them in a central repository and review material 
risks on a regular basis. The IRM function reviews and 
challenges the LOB and Corporate’s identified risks, 
maintains the central repository and provides the 
consolidated Firmwide results to the Firmwide Risk 
Committee (“FRC”) and the Board Risk Committee. 
Risk appetite
The Firm’s overall appetite for risk is governed by “Risk 
Appetite” frameworks for quantitative and qualitative risks. 
The Firm’s risk appetite is periodically set and approved by 
senior management (including the CEO and CRO) and 
approved by the Board Risk Committee. Quantitative and 
qualitative risks are assessed to monitor and measure the 
Firm’s capacity to take risk consistent with its stated risk 
appetite. Risk appetite results are reported to the Board 
Risk Committee. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

Risk governance and oversight structure
The independent status of the IRM function is supported by a risk governance and oversight structure that provides channels 
for the escalation of risks and issues to senior management, the FRC, and the Board of Directors, as appropriate. 
The chart below illustrates the principal standing committees of the Board of Directors and key senior management-level 
committees in the Firm’s risk governance and oversight structure. In addition, there are other committees, forums and 
channels of escalation that support the oversight of risk that are not shown in the chart below or described in this Form 10-K.
The Firm’s Operating Committee, which consists of the 
Firm’s CEO, CRO, Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), General 
Counsel, CEOs of the LOBs and other senior executives, is 
accountable to and may refer matters to the Firm’s Board of 
Directors. The Operating Committee and certain other 
members of senior management are responsible for 
escalating to the Board the information necessary to 
facilitate the Board’s exercise of its duties.
Board oversight
The Firm’s Board of Directors actively oversees the business 
and affairs of the Firm. This includes monitoring the Firm’s 
financial performance and condition and reviewing the 
strategic objectives and plans of the Firm. The Board carries 
out a significant portion of its oversight responsibilities 
through its principal standing committees, each of which 
consists solely of independent members of the Board. The 
Board Risk Committee is the principal committee that 
oversees risk matters. The Audit Committee oversees the 
control environment, and the Compensation & Management 
Development Committee oversees compensation and other 
management-related matters. Each committee of the Board 
oversees reputation risks, conduct risks, and environmental, 
social and governance (“ESG”) matters within its scope of 
responsibility.
The JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Board of Directors is 
responsible for the oversight of management of the bank, 
which it discharges both acting directly and through the 
principal standing committees of the Firm’s Board of 
Directors. Risk and control oversight on behalf of JPMorgan 
Chase Bank N.A. is primarily the responsibility of the Board 
Risk Committee and the Audit Committee, respectively, and, 
with respect to compensation and other managementrelated matters, the Compensation & Management 
Development Committee.
The Board Risk Committee assists the Board in its oversight 
of management’s responsibility to implement a global risk 
management framework reasonably designed to identify, 
assess and manage the Firm’s risks. The Board Risk 
Committee’s responsibilities include approval of applicable 
primary risk policies and review of certain associated 
frameworks, analysis and reporting established by 
management. Breaches in risk appetite and parameters, 
issues that may have a material adverse impact on the Firm, 
including capital and liquidity issues, and other significant 
risk-related matters are escalated to the Board Risk 
Committee, as appropriate.
The Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of 
management’s responsibility to ensure that there is an 
effective system of controls reasonably designed to 
safeguard the Firm’s assets and income, ensure the integrity 
of the Firm’s financial statements, and maintain compliance 
with the Firm’s ethical standards, policies, plans and 
procedures, and with laws, rules and regulations. It also 
assists the Board in its oversight of the qualifications, 
independence and performance of the Firm’s independent 
registered public accounting firm, and of the performance 
of the Firm’s Internal Audit function.

of Operating Committee members against their goals, and 
approves their compensation awards. In addition, the CEO’s 
award is subject to ratification by the independent directors 
of the Board. The CMDC also reviews the development of 
and succession for key executives. As part of the Board’s 
role of reinforcing, demonstrating and communicating the 
“tone at the top,” the CMDC oversees the Firm’s culture, 
including reviewing updates from management regarding 
significant conduct issues and any related actions with 
respect to employees, including compensation actions.

recommends to the Board corporate governance practices 
applicable to the Firm. It also reviews the framework for 
assessing the Board’s performance and self-evaluation. 
Management oversight
The Firm’s senior management-level committees that are 
primarily responsible for key risk-related functions include:
The Firmwide Risk Committee (“FRC”) is the Firm’s highest 
management-level risk committee. It oversees the risks 
inherent in the Firm’s business and provides a forum for 
discussion of topics and issues that are raised or escalated 
by its members and other committees.
The Firmwide Control Committee (“FCC”) is an escalation 
committee for senior management to review and discuss 
the Firmwide compliance and operational risk environment 
including identified issues, compliance and operational risk 
metrics and significant events that have been escalated. 
Line of Business and Regional Risk Committees are 
responsible for overseeing the governance, limits, and 
controls that have been established within the scope of 
their respective activities. These committees review the 
ways in which the particular LOB or the businesses 
operating in a particular region could be exposed to 
adverse outcomes, with a focus on identifying, accepting, 
escalating and/or requiring remediation of matters brought 
to these committees. 
Line of Business and Corporate Function Control Committees 
oversee the risk and control environment of their respective 
business or function, inclusive of Operational Risk, 
Compliance and Conduct Risks. As part of that mandate, 
they are responsible for reviewing indicators of elevated or 
emerging risks and other data that may impact the level of 
compliance and operational risk in a business or function, 
addressing key compliance and operational risk issues, with 
an emphasis on processes with control concerns and 
overseeing control remediation. 
The Asset and Liability Committee (“ALCO”) is responsible for 
overseeing the Firm’s asset and liability management 
(“ALM”), including the activities and frameworks supporting 
management of the balance sheet, liquidity risk, interest 
rate risk, and capital risk. 
The Firmwide Valuation Governance Forum (“VGF”) is 
composed of senior finance and risk executives and is 
responsible for overseeing the management of risks arising 
from valuation activities conducted across the Firm.
Risk governance and oversight functions
The Firm manages its risk through risk governance and 
oversight functions. The scope of a particular function or 
business activity may include one or more drivers, types 
and/or impacts of risk. For example, Country Risk 
Management oversees country risk which may be a driver of 
risk or an aggregation of exposures that could give rise to 
multiple risk types such as credit or market risk. 
The following sections discuss the risk governance and 
oversight functions that have been established to manage 
the risks inherent in the Firm’s business activities.

STRATEGIC RISK MANAGEMENT 
Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or 
reputation associated with poorly designed or failed 
business plans or an inadequate response to changes in the 
operating environment. 
Management and oversight
The Operating Committee, together with the senior 
leadership of each LOB and Corporate, are responsible for 
managing the Firm’s most significant strategic risks. IRM 
engages regularly in strategic business discussions and 
decision-making, including participation in relevant 
business reviews and senior management meetings, risk 
and control committees and other relevant governance 
forums, and review of acquisitions and new business 
initiatives. The Board of Directors oversees management’s 
strategic decisions, and the Board Risk Committee oversees 
IRM and the Firm’s risk governance framework.
In the process of developing business plans and strategic 
initiatives, LOB and Corporate senior management identify 
the associated risks that are incorporated into the Firmwide 
Risk Identification framework and their impact on risk 
appetite. 
In addition, IRM conducts a qualitative assessment of the 
LOB and Corporate strategic initiatives to assess their 
impact on the risk profile of the Firm. 
The Firm’s strategic planning process, which includes the 
development of the Firm’s strategic plan and other strategic 
initiatives, is one component of managing the Firm’s 
strategic risk. The strategic plan outlines the Firm’s 
strategic framework and initiatives, and includes 
components such as budget, risk appetite, capital, earnings 
and asset-liability management objectives. Guided by the 
Firm’s Business Principles, the Operating Committee and 
senior management teams in each LOB and Corporate 
review and update the strategic plan periodically, including 
evaluating the strategic framework and performance 
against prior-year initiatives, assessing the operating 
environment, refining existing strategies and developing 
new strategies.

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Capital risk is the risk that the Firm has an insufficient level 
or composition of capital to support the Firm’s business 
activities and associated risks during normal economic 
environments and under stressed conditions.
A strong capital position is essential to the Firm’s business 
strategy and competitive position. Maintaining a strong 
balance sheet to manage through economic volatility is a 
strategic imperative of the Firm’s Board of Directors, CEO 
and Operating Committee. The Firm’s “fortress balance 
sheet” philosophy focuses on risk-adjusted returns, strong 
capital and robust liquidity. The Firm’s capital risk 
management strategy focuses on maintaining long-term 
stability to enable the Firm to build and invest in marketleading businesses, including in highly stressed 
environments. Senior management considers the 
implications on the Firm’s capital prior to making significant 
decisions that could impact future business activities. In 
addition to considering the Firm’s earnings outlook, senior 
management evaluates all sources and uses of capital with 
a view to ensuring the Firm’s capital strength.
Capital risk management
The Firm has a Capital Risk Management function whose 
primary objective is to provide independent oversight of 
capital risk across the Firm. 
Capital Risk Management’s responsibilities include:
• Defining, monitoring and reporting capital risk metrics;
• Establishing, calibrating and monitoring capital risk limits 
and indicators, including capital risk appetite;
• Developing processes to classify, monitor and report 
capital limit breaches; 
• Performing assessments of the Firm’s capital 
management activities, including changes made to the 
Contingency Capital Plan described below; and
• Conducting assessments of the Firm's regulatory capital 
framework intended to ensure compliance with 
applicable regulatory capital rules.
Capital management
Treasury and CIO is responsible for capital management. 
The primary objectives of the Firm’s capital management 
are to:
• Maintain sufficient capital in order to continue to build 
and invest in the Firm’s businesses through normal 
economic cycles and in stressed environments;
• Retain flexibility to take advantage of future investment 
opportunities;
• Promote the Parent Company’s ability to serve as a 
source of strength to its subsidiaries;
• Ensure the Firm operates above the minimum regulatory 
capital ratios as well as maintain “well-capitalized” status 
for the Firm and its principal insured depository 
institution (“IDI”) subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 
at all times under applicable regulatory capital 
requirements;
• Meet capital distribution objectives; and
• Maintain sufficient capital resources to operate 
throughout a resolution period in accordance with the 
Firm’s preferred resolution strategy.
The Firm addresses these objectives through: 
• Establishing internal minimum capital requirements and 
maintaining a strong capital governance framework. The 
internal minimum capital levels consider the Firm’s 
regulatory capital requirements as well as an internal 
assessment of capital adequacy, in normal economic 
cycles and in stress events;
• Retaining flexibility in order to react to a range of 
potential events; and
• Regularly monitoring the Firm’s capital position and 
following prescribed escalation protocols, both at the 
Firm and material legal entity levels.
Governance
Committees responsible for overseeing the Firm’s capital 
management include the Capital Governance Committee, 
the Firmwide ALCO as well as regional ALCOs, and the CIO, 
Treasury and Corporate (“CTC”) Risk Committee. In 
addition, the Board Risk Committee periodically reviews the 
Firm’s capital risk tolerance. Refer to Firmwide Risk 
Management on pages 86–89 for additional discussion of 
the Firmwide ALCO and other risk-related committees.
Capital planning and stress testing
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review 
The Federal Reserve requires the Firm, as a large Bank 
Holding Company (“BHC”), to submit at least annually a 
capital plan that has been reviewed and approved by the 
Board of Directors. The Federal Reserve uses 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) and 
other stress testing processes to assess whether large BHCs, 
such as the Firm, have sufficient capital during periods of 
economic and financial stress, and have robust, forwardlooking capital assessment and planning processes in place 
that address each BHC’s unique risks to enable it to absorb 
losses under certain stress scenarios. Through CCAR, the 
Federal Reserve evaluates each BHC’s capital adequacy and 
internal capital adequacy assessment processes (“ICAAP”), 
as well as its plans to make capital distributions, such as 
dividend payments or stock repurchases. The Federal 
Reserve uses results under the severely adverse scenario 
from its supervisory stress test to determine each firm’s 
Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”) requirement for the coming 
year. 
The Firm's current SCB requirement is 2.9%, and will 
remain in effect until September 30, 2024. The Firm’s 
Standardized CET1 capital ratio requirement, including 
regulatory buffers, was 11.4% as of December 31, 2023.
Refer to Capital actions on page 99 for information on 
actions taken by the Firm’s Board of Directors. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process 
Annually, the Firm prepares the ICAAP, which informs the 
Board of Directors of the ongoing assessment of the Firm’s 
processes for managing the sources and uses of capital as 
well as compliance with supervisory expectations for capital 
planning and capital adequacy. The Firm’s ICAAP integrates 
stress testing protocols with capital planning. The Firm’s 
Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving 
the capital planning framework.
Stress testing assesses the potential impact of alternative 
economic and business scenarios on the Firm’s earnings 
and capital. Economic scenarios, and the parameters 
underlying those scenarios, are defined centrally and 
applied uniformly across the businesses. These scenarios 
are articulated in terms of macroeconomic factors, which 
are key drivers of business results; global market shocks, 
which generate short-term but severe trading losses; and 
idiosyncratic operational risk events. The scenarios are 
intended to capture and stress key vulnerabilities and 
idiosyncratic risks facing the Firm. In addition to CCAR and 
other periodic stress testing, management also considers 
tailored stress scenarios and sensitivity analyses, as 
necessary. 
Contingency Capital Plan
The Firm’s Contingency Capital Plan establishes the capital 
management framework for the Firm and specifies the 
principles underlying the Firm’s approach towards capital 
management in normal economic conditions and in stressed 
environments. The Contingency Capital Plan defines how 
the Firm calibrates its targeted capital levels and meets 
minimum capital requirements, monitors the ongoing 
appropriateness of planned capital distributions, and sets 
out the capital contingency actions that are expected to be 
taken or considered at various levels of capital depletion 
during a period of stress.
Regulatory capital
The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, 
including well-capitalized standards, for the Firm as a 
consolidated financial holding company. The Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") establishes similar 
minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm’s 
principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The U.S. 
capital requirements generally follow the Capital Accord of 
the Basel Committee, as amended from time to time.
Basel III Overview
The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital 
ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and 
internationally active U.S. BHCs and banks, including the 
Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount 
of regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is 
determined by calculating RWA, which are on-balance sheet 
assets and off-balance sheet exposures, weighted according 
to risk. Under the rules currently in effect, two 
comprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating 
RWA: a standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), 
and an advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). 
For each of these risk-based capital ratios, the capital 
adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the lower of the 
Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their 
respective regulatory capital ratio requirements.
In July 2023, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC 
released a proposal to amend the risk-based capital 
framework, entitled "Regulatory capital rule: Amendments 
applicable to large banking organizations and to banking 
organizations with significant trading activity," which is 
referred to in this Form 10-K as “U.S. Basel III proposal”. 
Under the proposal, changes to the framework would 
include replacement of the Advanced approach with an 
expanded risk-based approach, which would not permit the 
use of internal models for the calculation of RWA, other 
than for market risk. In addition, the stress capital buffer 
requirement would be applicable to both the expanded riskbased approach and the Standardized approach. The 
proposal would significantly revise risk-based capital 
requirements for all banks with assets of $100 billion or 
more, including the Firm and other U.S. GSIBs. The 
proposed effective date is July 1, 2025, with a three-year 
transition period applicable to the expanded risk-based 
approach. Based on the Firm's understanding of the 
proposal, as applied to its Consolidated balance sheets as of 
June 30, 2023 (the reference date for a special data 
collection exercise conducted by the Federal Reserve), the 
estimated impact at the end of the transition period would 
increase RWA by approximately 30%, which would result in 
an approximately 25% increase to CET1 capital necessary 
to meet the Firm’s CET1 ratio requirement, all else equal. 
These estimates do not reflect any actions that the Firm 
may take to mitigate the impact of the rule as currently 
proposed.
Pending the finalization of the U.S. Basel III proposal, the 
Firm expects that it will continue to build capital above the 
current levels, and therefore the CET1 target of 13.5% 
previously set by the Firm (which was with respect to the 
current Standardized RWA measure) is no longer 
meaningful. The Firm's quarterly capital ratios will vary 
dependent on market conditions and other factors. Under 
the requirements of the U.S. Basel III proposal, the new 
expanded risk-based approach, when fully phased-in, would 
be the Firm’s binding constraint.
The current Basel III rules establish capital requirements for 
calculating credit risk RWA and market risk RWA, and in the 
case of Basel III Advanced, operational risk RWA. Key 
differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between 
the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for 
Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive 
approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit 
models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, 
credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory riskweightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and 
asset class. Market risk RWA is generally calculated 
consistently between Basel III Standardized and Basel III 
Advanced. In addition to the RWA calculated under these 
approaches, the Firm may supplement such amounts to 
Management’s discussion and analysis

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

incorporate management judgment and feedback from its 
regulators.
As of December 31, 2023, the Advanced Total Capital ratio 
became the most binding constraint for the Firm’s Basel III 
risk-based ratios, primarily reflecting the reduction in the 
Stress Capital Buffer requirement. However, as of December 
31, 2023, with respect to the CET1 and Tier 1 risk-based 
ratios, the Standardized ratios are more binding than the 
Advanced ratios. 
Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced 
Approaches banking organizations, including the Firm, to 
calculate its SLR. As of the fourth quarter of 2023, the 
Firm’s SLR became more binding than the Basel III riskbased ratios, primarily reflecting the reduction in the Stress 
Capital Buffer requirement. With the increase in the GSIB 
surcharge in the first quarter of 2024, the Firm expects the 
risk-based ratios to revert to being more binding than the 
SLR.
Refer to page 95 for additional information on GSIB 
surcharge and page 98 for additional information on SLR.
Other Key Regulatory Developments 
GSIB Surcharge
In July 2023, the Federal Reserve also released a proposal 
to amend the calculation of the GSIB surcharge. If adopted 
as proposed, these amendments would require the Firm to 
assess its GSIB surcharge on an annual basis, using the 
average of the quarterly surcharge calculations throughout 
the calendar year, with daily averaging required for certain 
measures within the surcharge calculation. Surcharge 
increments would be reduced from 50 bps to 10 bps and 
there would also be other technical amendments to the 
Method 2 calculation. The proposed amendments would 
revise risk-based capital requirements for the Firm and 
other U.S. GSIBs, and would become effective two calendar 
quarters after the adoption of the final rule. Refer to Riskbased Capital Regulatory Requirements on pages 94-95 for 
further information on the GSIB surcharge.
TLAC and Eligible LTD Requirements
In August 2023, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC 
released a proposal to expand the eligible long-term debt 
("eligible LTD") and clean holding company requirements 
under the existing total loss-absorbing capacity ("TLAC") 
rule to apply to non-GSIB banks with $100 billion or more 
in total consolidated assets. While U.S. GSIBs are already 
subject to these requirements, the proposal would reduce 
the amount of LTD with remaining maturities of less than 
two years that count towards a U.S. GSIB's TLAC 
requirement. The proposal would also expand the existing 
capital deduction framework for LTD issued by GSIBs to 
include LTD issued by non-GSIB banks subject to the LTD 
requirements.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

Risk-based Capital Regulatory Requirements 
The following chart presents the Firm’s Basel III CET1 capital ratio requirements under the Basel III rules currently in effect.
All banking institutions are currently required to have a 
minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted 
assets.
Certain banking organizations, including the Firm, are 
required to hold additional levels of capital to serve as a 
“capital conservation buffer”. The capital conservation 
buffer incorporates a GSIB surcharge, a discretionary 
countercyclical capital buffer and a fixed capital 
conservation buffer of 2.5% for Advanced regulatory 
capital requirements, as well as a variable SCB requirement, 
floored at 2.5%, for Standardized regulatory capital 
requirements. 
Under the Federal Reserve’s GSIB rule, the Firm is required 
to assess its GSIB surcharge on an annual basis under two 
separately prescribed methods based on data for the 
previous fiscal year-end, and is subject to the higher of the 
two. “Method 1” reflects the GSIB surcharge as prescribed 
by the Basel Committee’s assessment methodology, and is 
calculated by the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”) across 
five criteria: size, cross-jurisdictional activity, 
interconnectedness, complexity and substitutability. 
“Method 2”, calculated by the Firm, modifies the Method 1 
requirements to include a measure of short-term wholesale 
funding in place of substitutability, and introduces a GSIB 
score “multiplication factor”.

On November 27, 2023, the FSB released its annual list of 
GSIBs based upon data as of December 31, 2022, which 
affirmed the Firm’s Method 1 GSIB surcharge of 2.5%, 
which will be effective January 1, 2025, unless the Firm’s 
Method 1 GSIB surcharge, as determined by the FSB, is 
lower based upon data as of December 31, 2023.
The Firm’s Method 2 surcharge calculated using data as of 
December 31, 2021 is 4.5% (up from 4.0%), which 
became effective January 1, 2024. The Firm’s estimated 
Method 2 surcharge calculated using data as of December 
31, 2022 is 4.5%. Accordingly, based on the GSIB rule 
currently in effect, the Firm’s effective GSIB surcharge 
increased to 4.5% on January 1, 2024.
The U.S. federal regulatory capital standards include a 
framework for setting a discretionary countercyclical capital 
buffer taking into account the macro financial environment 
in which large, internationally active banks function. As of 
December 31, 2023, the U.S. countercyclical capital buffer 
remained at 0%. The Federal Reserve will continue to 
review the buffer at least annually. The buffer can be 
increased if the Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC determine 
that systemic risks are meaningfully above normal and can 
be calibrated up to an additional 2.5% of RWA subject to a 
12-month implementation period. 
Failure to maintain regulatory capital equal to or in excess 
of the risk-based regulatory capital minimum plus the 
capital conservation buffer (inclusive of the GSIB surcharge) 
and any countercyclical buffer will result in limitations to 
the amount of capital that the Firm may distribute, such as 
through dividends and common share repurchases, as well 
as on discretionary bonus payments for certain executive 
officers.
Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity
The Federal Reserve’s TLAC rule requires the U.S. GSIB toptier holding companies, including the Firm, to maintain 
minimum levels of external TLAC and eligible LTD. Refer to 
TLAC on page 100 for additional information.
Leverage-based Capital Regulatory Requirements
Supplementary leverage ratio
Banking organizations subject to the Basel III Advanced 
approach are currently required to have a minimum SLR of 
3.0%. Certain banking organizations, including the Firm, 
are also required to hold an additional 2.0% leverage 
buffer. The SLR is defined as Tier 1 capital under Basel III 
divided by the Firm’s total leverage exposure. Total 
leverage exposure is calculated by taking the Firm’s total 
average on-balance sheet assets, less amounts permitted to 
be deducted for Tier 1 capital, and adding certain offbalance sheet exposures, as defined in regulatory capital 
rules. Refer to SLR on page 98 for additional information.
Failure to maintain an SLR equal to or greater than the 
regulatory requirement will result in limitations on the 
amount of capital that the Firm may distribute such as 
through dividends and common share repurchases, as well 
as on discretionary bonus payments for certain executive 
officers.
Other regulatory capital
In addition to meeting the capital ratio requirements of 
Basel III, the Firm and its principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. must also maintain minimum capital and 
leverage ratios in order to be “well-capitalized” under the 
regulations issued by the Federal Reserve and the Prompt 
Corrective Action requirements of the FDIC Improvement 
Act, respectively. Refer to Note 27 for additional 
information. 
Additional information regarding the Firm’s capital ratios, 
as well as the U.S. federal regulatory capital standards to 
which the Firm is subject, is presented in Note 27. Refer to 
the Firm’s Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, 
which are available on the Firm’s website, for further 
information on the Firm’s current capital measures.

Line of business equity 
Each business segment is allocated capital by taking into 
consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of 
similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital 
requirements. ROE is measured and internal targets for 
expected returns are established as key measures of a 
business segment’s performance. 
The Firm’s current allocation methodology incorporates 
Basel III Standardized RWA and the GSIB surcharge, both 
under rules currently in effect, as well as a simulation of 
capital in a severe stress environment. At least annually, 
the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to 
allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital 
allocated to the LOBs may change. As of January 1, 2024, 
changes to the Firm’s line of business capital allocations are 
primarily a result of updates to the Firm’s current capital 
requirements and changes in RWA for each LOB under rules 
currently in effect. In addition, the capital that the Firm has 
accumulated to meet the increased requirements of the U.S. 
Basel III proposal has generally been retained in Corporate.

business segment.

Act of 2022, a 1% excise tax was imposed on net share repurchases 
effective January 1, 2023.
(b) In the second half of 2022, the Firm temporarily suspended share 
repurchases, which it resumed under its current common share 
repurchase program in the first quarter of 2023.
(c) As directed by the Federal Reserve, total net repurchases and common 
stock dividends in the first and second quarter of 2021 were restricted 
and could not exceed the average of the Firm’s net income for the four 
preceding calendar quarters. Effective July 1, 2021, the Firm became 
subject to the normal capital distribution restrictions provided under 
the regulatory capital framework.
The Board of Directors’ authorization to repurchase 
common shares is utilized at management’s discretion, and 
the timing of purchases and the exact amount of common 
shares that may be repurchased is subject to various 
factors, including market conditions; legal and regulatory 
considerations affecting the amount and timing of 
repurchase activity; the Firm’s capital position (taking into 
account goodwill and intangibles); internal capital 
generation; current and proposed future capital 
requirements; and alternative investment opportunities. 
The $30 billion common share repurchase program 
approved by the Board does not establish specific price 
targets or timetables. The repurchase program may be 
suspended by management at any time; and may be 
executed through open market purchases or privately 
negotiated transactions, or utilizing Rule 10b5-1 plans, 
which are written trading plans that the Firm may enter into 
from time to time under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 and which allow the Firm to 
repurchase its common shares during periods when it may 
otherwise not be repurchasing common shares — for 
example, during internal trading blackout periods.

Other capital requirements 
Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity
The Federal Reserve’s TLAC rule requires the U.S. GSIB toptier holding companies, including the Firm, to maintain 
minimum levels of external TLAC and eligible long-term 
debt.
The external TLAC requirements and the minimum level of 
eligible long-term debt requirements are shown below:
(a) RWA is the greater of Standardized and Advanced compared to their 
respective regulatory capital ratio requirements.
Failure to maintain TLAC equal to or in excess of the 
regulatory minimum plus applicable buffers will result in 
limitations on the amount of capital that the Firm may 
distribute, such as through dividends and common share 
repurchases, as well as on discretionary bonus payments 
for certain executive officers.
The following table presents the eligible external TLAC and 
eligible LTD amounts, as well as a representation of these

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet 
its cash and collateral needs as they arise or that it does not 
have the appropriate amount, composition and tenor of 
funding and liquidity to support its assets and liabilities. 
Liquidity risk management
The Firm has a Liquidity Risk Management (“LRM”) function 
whose primary objective is to provide independent 
oversight of liquidity risk across the Firm. Liquidity Risk 
Management’s responsibilities include: 
• Defining, monitoring and reporting liquidity risk metrics; 
• Independently establishing and monitoring limits and 
indicators, including liquidity risk appetite; 
• Developing a process to classify, monitor and report limit 
breaches; 
• Performing an independent review of liquidity risk 
management processes to evaluate their adequacy and 
effectiveness; 
• Monitoring and reporting internal Firmwide and legal 
entity liquidity stress tests, regulatory defined metrics, as 
well as liquidity positions, balance sheet variances and 
funding activities; and 
• Approving or escalating for review new or updated 
liquidity stress assumptions.
Liquidity management 
Treasury and CIO is responsible for liquidity management.
The primary objectives of the Firm’s liquidity management 
are to: 
• Ensure that the Firm’s core businesses and material legal 
entities are able to operate in support of client needs and 
meet contractual and contingent financial obligations 
through normal economic cycles as well as during stress 
events, and 
• Manage an optimal funding mix and availability of 
liquidity sources. 
The Firm addresses these objectives through: 
• Analyzing and understanding the liquidity characteristics 
of the assets and liabilities of the Firm, LOBs, legal 
entities, as well as currencies, taking into account legal, 
regulatory, and operational restrictions; 
• Developing internal liquidity stress testing assumptions; 
• Defining and monitoring Firmwide and legal entityspecific liquidity strategies, policies, reporting and 
contingency funding plans; 
• Managing liquidity within the Firm’s approved liquidity 
risk appetite tolerances and limits; 
• Managing compliance with regulatory requirements 
related to funding and liquidity risk; and 
• Setting FTP in accordance with underlying liquidity 
characteristics of balance sheet assets and liabilities as 
well as certain off-balance sheet items. 
As part of the Firm’s overall liquidity management strategy, 
the Firm manages liquidity and funding using a centralized, 
global approach designed to: 
• Optimize liquidity sources and uses; 
• Monitor exposures; 
• Identify constraints on the transfer of liquidity between 
the Firm’s legal entities; and 
• Maintain the appropriate amount of surplus liquidity at a 
Firmwide and legal entity level, where relevant. 
Governance
Committees responsible for liquidity governance include the 
Firmwide ALCO, as well as regional ALCOs, the Treasurer 
Committee, and the CTC Risk Committee. In addition, the 
Board Risk Committee reviews and recommends to the 
Board of Directors, for approval, the Firm’s liquidity risk 
tolerances, liquidity strategy, and liquidity policy. Refer to 
Firmwide Risk Management on pages 86–89 for further 
discussion of ALCO and other risk-related committees. 
Internal stress testing
The Firm conducts internal liquidity stress testing that is 
intended to ensure that the Firm and its material legal 
entities have sufficient liquidity under a variety of adverse 
scenarios, including scenarios analyzed as part of the Firm’s 
resolution and recovery planning. Internal stress tests are 
produced on a regular basis, and other stress tests are 
performed in response to specific market events or 
concerns. Liquidity stress tests assume all of the Firm’s 
contractual financial obligations are met and take into 
consideration: 
• Varying levels of access to unsecured and secured 
funding markets; 
• Estimated non-contractual and contingent cash outflows;
• Credit rating downgrades; 
• Collateral haircuts; and 
• Potential impediments to the availability and 
transferability of liquidity between jurisdictions and 
material legal entities such as regulatory, legal or other 
restrictions. 
Liquidity outflows are modeled across a range of time 
horizons and currency dimensions and contemplate both 
market and idiosyncratic stresses. 
Results of stress tests are considered in the formulation of 
the Firm’s funding plan and assessment of its liquidity 
position. The Parent Company acts as a source of funding 
for the Firm through equity and long-term debt issuances, 
and its intermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase 
Holdings LLC (the “IHC”), provides funding to support the 
ongoing operations of the Parent Company and its 
subsidiaries. The Firm maintains liquidity at the Parent 
Company, the IHC, and operating subsidiaries at levels 
sufficient to comply with liquidity risk tolerances and 
minimum liquidity requirements, and to manage through 
Management’s discussion and analysis

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

periods of stress when access to normal funding sources 
may be disrupted.
Contingency funding plan
The Firm’s Contingency Funding Plan (“CFP”) sets out the 
strategies for addressing and managing liquidity resource 
needs during a liquidity stress event and incorporates 
liquidity risk limits, indicators and risk appetite tolerances. 
The CFP also identifies the alternative contingent funding 
and liquidity resources available to the Firm and its legal 
entities in a period of stress. 
LCR and HQLA
The LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is 
sufficient to meet their respective estimated total net cash 
outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of 
significant stress. Eligible HQLA, for purposes of calculating 
the LCR, is the amount of unencumbered HQLA that satisfy 
certain operational considerations as defined in the LCR 
rule. HQLA primarily consist of cash and certain high-quality 
liquid securities as defined in the LCR rule.
Under the LCR rule, the amount of eligible HQLA held by 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its standalone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that is not 
transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded from 
the Firm’s reported eligible HQLA. 
Estimated net cash outflows are based on standardized 
stress outflow and inflow rates prescribed in the LCR rule, 
which are applied to the balances of the Firm’s assets, 
sources of funds, and obligations. The LCR for both the Firm 
and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a 
minimum of 100%. 
The following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended 
December 31, 2023, September 30, 2023 and

by CIB market activities, partially offset by loan growth.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three 
months ended December 31, 2023 decreased compared 
with the three months ended December 31, 2022, 
reflecting a decrease in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s HQLA 
as a result of a reduction in cash due to a decline in average 
deposits and loan growth, as well as the impact of First 
Republic and lower market values of HQLA-eligible 
investment securities. These impacts were partially offset 
by CIB markets activities.

Three months ended December 31, 2022 

Actions by the Federal Reserve have impacted depositor 
behavior, resulting in reductions to system-wide deposits, 
including those held by the Firm. Each of the Firm and 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR may fluctuate 
from period to period due to changes in their respective 
eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of 
ongoing business activity and from the continued impacts of 
Federal Reserve actions as well as other factors. Refer to 
the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports, which are available 
on the Firm’s website, for a further discussion of the Firm’s 
LCR.
Liquidity sources
In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s eligible 
HQLA discussed above, the Firm had unencumbered 
marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities, 
that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity. 
This includes excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank 
affiliates. The fair value of these securities was 
approximately $649 billion and $694 billion as of 
December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, although the 
amount of liquidity that could be raised at any particular 
time would be dependent on prevailing market conditions. 
The decrease compared to December 31, 2022, was driven 
by a reduction in excess eligible HQLA securities at 

in unencumbered AFS securities. 
As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Firm had 
approximately $1.4 trillion of available cash and securities 
comprised of eligible end-of-period HQLA, excluding the 
impact of regulatory haircuts of $798.0 billion and $735.5 
billion, respectively, and unencumbered marketable 
securities with a fair value of approximately $649 billion 
and $694 billion, respectively.
The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the 
Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLBs”) and the discount 
window at the Federal Reserve Banks as a result of 
collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of 
approximately $340 billion and $323 billion as of 
December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. This borrowing 
capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities 
reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered 
securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve 
Banks discount window and other central banks. Available 
borrowing capacity increased from December 31, 2022 
primarily due to a higher amount of wholesale loans 
pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks. Although available, 
the Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the 
Federal Reserve Banks discount window and the other 
central banks as a primary source of liquidity.
NSFR
The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity 
requirement for large banking organizations that is 
intended to measure the adequacy of “available” stable 
funding that is sufficient to meet their “required” amounts 
of stable funding over a one-year horizon. 
For the three months ended December 31, 2023, both the 
Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were compliant with 
the 100% minimum NSFR requirement, based on the Firm’s 
interpretation of the final rule. Refer to the Firm's U.S. NSFR 
Disclosure report covering December 31, 2023 and 
September 30, 2023 on the Firm’s website for additional 
information.
Management’s discussion and analysis

Funding
Sources of funds
Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and secured 
funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and off-balance 
sheet obligations, which includes both short- and long-term 
cash requirements.
The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse 
sources of funding including stable deposits, secured and 
unsecured funding in the capital markets and stockholders’ 
equity. Deposits are the primary funding source for 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. may access funding through short- or long-term 
secured borrowings, the issuance of unsecured long-term 
debt, or from borrowings from the IHC. The Firm’s non-bank 
subsidiaries are primarily funded from long-term unsecured 
borrowings and short-term secured borrowings which are 
primarily securities loaned or sold under repurchase 
agreements. Excess funding is invested by Treasury and CIO 
in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio or deployed in 
cash or other short-term liquid investments based on their 
interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics. 
Refer to Note 28 for additional information on off–balance 
sheet obligations.

The Firm believes that deposits provide a stable source of 
funding and reduce the Firm’s reliance on the wholesale 
funding markets. A significant portion of the Firm’s deposits 
are consumer deposits and wholesale operating deposits, 
which are both considered to be stable sources of liquidity. 
Wholesale operating deposits are generally considered to be 
stable sources of liquidity because they are generated from 
customers that maintain operating service relationships with 
the Firm. 
The Firm believes that average deposit balances are 
generally more representative of deposit trends than periodend deposit balances. However, during periods of market 
disruption, average deposit trends may be impacted.
Average deposits were lower for the year ended December 
31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, 
reflecting the net impact of:
• lower balances in AWM due to continued migration into 
higher-yielding investments driven by the higher interest 
rate environment, partially offset by growth from new and 
existing customers as a result of new product offerings 
and the impact of First Republic,
• a decline in CCB reflecting higher customer spending, 
largely offset by the impact of First Republic, 
• a decrease in CB due to continued deposit attrition as 
clients seek higher-yielding investments, partially offset 
by the retention of inflows associated with disruptions in 
the market in the first quarter of 2023, 
• a decline in CIB due to deposit attrition, including actions 
taken to reduce certain deposits, predominantly offset by 
net issuances of structured notes as a result of client 
demand, and 
• growth in Corporate related to the Firm's international 
consumer initiatives. 
Period-end deposits increased from December 31, 2022, 
reflecting the net impact of:
• higher balances in CIB due to net issuances of structured 
notes as a result of client demand, as well as deposit 
inflows from client-driven activities in Payments and 
Securities Services, partially offset by deposit attrition, 
including actions taken to reduce certain deposits,
• growth in Corporate related to the Firm's international 
consumer initiatives,
• lower balances in CCB reflecting higher customer 
spending,
• a decline in AWM due to continued migration into higheryielding investments driven by the higher interest rate 
environment, predominantly offset by growth from new 
and existing customers as a result of new product 
offerings, and
• a decrease in CB due to continued deposit attrition as 
clients seek higher-yielding investments, predominantly 
offset by the retention of inflows associated with 
disruptions in the market in the first quarter of 2023.
The net increase also included $61 billion of deposits 
associated with First Republic, primarily reflected in CCB, 
AWM and CB.

Certain deposits are covered by insurance protection that 
provides additional funding stability and results in a benefit 
to the LCR. Deposit insurance protection may be available 
to depositors in the countries in which the deposits are 
placed. For example, the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation (“FDIC”) provides deposit insurance protection 
for deposits placed in a U.S. depository institution. At 
December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Firmwide estimated 
uninsured deposits were $1,331.9 billion and $1,383.7 
billion, respectively, primarily reflecting wholesale 
operating deposits.
Total uninsured deposits include time deposits. The table 
below presents an estimate of uninsured U.S. and non-U.S. 
time deposits, and their remaining maturities. The Firm’s 
estimates of its uninsured U.S. time deposits are based on 
data that the Firm calculates periodically under applicable 
FDIC regulations. For purposes of this presentation, all nonU.S. time deposits are deemed to be uninsured.

Short-term funding 
The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding primarily 
consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to 
repurchase. These instruments are secured predominantly 
by high-quality securities collateral, including governmentissued debt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS. 
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased 
at December 31, 2023, compared with December 31, 
2022, reflecting the impact of a lower level of netting on 
reduced repurchase activity. 
The balances associated with securities loaned or sold 
under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to 
investment and financing activities of clients, the Firm’s 
demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix 
of the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured 
financing (for both the investment securities and marketmaking portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors.
The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding 
primarily consist of issuances of wholesale commercial 
paper and other borrowed funds. 
The increase in period-end commercial paper and the 
decrease in average balances for the year ended 
December 31, 2023 compared to the respective prior year 
periods were due to changes in net issuance levels primarily 
for short-term liquidity management.
The decrease in average secured other borrowed funds for 
the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior 
year period was primarily due to lower financing of Markets 
activities.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

Average 2022 

Long-term funding and issuance
Long-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term funding plan 
is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations and regulatory requirements, including TLAC. Long-term 
funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm 
evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan. 
The significant majority of the Firm’s total outstanding long-term debt has been issued by the Parent Company to provide 
flexibility in support of the funding needs of both bank and non-bank subsidiaries. The Parent Company advances substantially 
all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external counterparties. For the year ended 
December 31, 2023, the increase in period-end structured notes compared to the prior year period was attributable to net 
issuances of structured notes in Markets due to client demand and an increase in fair value.
The following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the years ended 
December 31, 2023 and 2022. Refer to Note 20 for additional information on the IHC and long-term debt.

Credit ratings
The cost and availability of financing are influenced by 
credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an 
adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources, 
increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or 
funding requirements and decrease the number of investors 
and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature 
and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades 
depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors,
which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk 
and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it 
maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential 
decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades.
Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and 
other third-party commitments may be adversely affected 
by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to Note 5 and Note 14 
for additional information.
The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of December 31, 2023,

REPUTATION RISK MANAGEMENT
Reputation risk is the risk that an action or inaction may 
negatively impact perception of the Firm’s integrity and 
reduce confidence in the Firm’s competence by various 
stakeholders, including clients, counterparties, customers, 
communities, investors, regulators, or employees. 
The types of events that may result in reputation risk are 
wide-ranging and can be introduced by the Firm’s 
employees, business strategies and activities, clients, 
customers and counterparties with which the Firm does 
business. These events could contribute to financial losses, 
litigation, regulatory enforcement actions, fines, penalties 
or other sanctions, as well as other harm to the Firm. 
Organization and management 
Reputation Risk Management is an independent risk 
management function that establishes the governance 
framework for managing reputation risk across the Firm’s 
LOBs and Corporate. Reputation risk is inherently 
challenging to identify, manage, and quantify.
The Firm’s reputation risk management function includes 
the following activities:
• Maintaining a Firmwide Reputation Risk Governance 
policy and a standard consistent with the reputation risk 
framework 
• Providing oversight of the governance framework 
through processes and infrastructure to support 
consistent identification, escalation and monitoring of 
reputation risk issues Firmwide
Governance and oversight
The Reputation Risk Governance policy establishes the 
principles for managing reputation risk for the Firm. It is 
the responsibility of each LOB, Corporate and employees to 
consider the reputation of the Firm when deciding whether 
to offer a new product, engage in a transaction or client 
relationship, enter a new jurisdiction, initiate a business 
process or consider any other activity. Environmental 
impacts and social concerns are increasingly important 
considerations in assessing the Firm’s reputation risk, and 
are a component of the Firm’s reputation risk governance.

CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT
Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the 
default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty 
or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected 
returns on investments, including consumer credit risk, 
wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk.
Credit risk management
Credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change 
in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer. The 
Firm provides credit to a variety of clients and customers, 
ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to 
individual consumers and small businesses. In its consumer 
businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily 
through its home lending, credit card, auto, and business 
banking businesses. In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is 
exposed to credit risk through its underwriting, lending, 
market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients 
and counterparties, as well as through its operating services 
activities (such as cash management and clearing 
activities), and securities financing activities. The Firm is 
also exposed to credit risk through its investment securities 
portfolio and cash placed with banks.
Credit Risk Management monitors, measures and manages 
credit risk throughout the Firm and defines credit risk 
policies and procedures. The Firm’s credit risk management 
governance includes the following activities:
• Maintaining a credit risk policy framework
• Monitoring, measuring and managing credit risk across 
all portfolio segments, including transaction and 
exposure approval
• Setting industry and geographic concentration limits, as 
appropriate, and establishing underwriting guidelines 
• Assigning and managing credit approval authorities in 
connection with the approval of credit exposure
• Managing criticized exposures and delinquent loans, and
• Estimating credit losses and supporting appropriate 
credit risk-based capital management
Risk identification and measurement
To measure credit risk, the Firm employs several 
methodologies for estimating the likelihood of obligor or 
counterparty default. Methodologies for measuring credit 
risk vary depending on several factors, including type of 
asset (e.g., consumer versus wholesale), risk measurement 
parameters (e.g., delinquency status and borrower’s credit 
score versus wholesale risk-rating) and risk management 
and collection processes (e.g., retail collection center 
versus centrally managed workout groups). Credit risk 
measurement is based on the probability of default of an 
obligor or counterparty, the loss severity given a default 
event and the exposure at default.
Based on these factors and the methodology and estimates 
described in Note 13 and Note 10, the Firm estimates credit 
losses for its exposures. The allowance for loan losses 
reflects estimated credit losses related to the consumer and 
wholesale held-for-investment loan portfolios, the 
allowance for lending-related commitments reflects 
estimated credit losses related to the Firm’s lending-related 
commitments and the allowance for investment securities 
reflects estimated credit losses related to the investment 
securities portfolio. Refer to Note 13, Note 10 and Critical 
Accounting Estimates used by the Firm on pages 155–158 
for further information.
In addition, potential and unexpected credit losses are 
reflected in the allocation of credit risk capital and 
represent the potential volatility of actual losses relative to 
the established allowances for loan losses and lendingrelated commitments. The analyses for these losses include 
stress testing that considers alternative economic scenarios 
as described below.
Stress testing
Stress testing is important in measuring and managing 
credit risk in the Firm’s credit portfolio. The stress testing 
process assesses the potential impact of alternative 
economic and business scenarios on estimated credit losses 
for the Firm. Economic scenarios and the underlying 
parameters are defined centrally, articulated in terms of 
macroeconomic factors and applied across the businesses. 
The stress test results may indicate credit migration, 
changes in delinquency trends and potential losses in the 
credit portfolio. In addition to the periodic stress testing 
processes, management also considers additional stresses 
outside these scenarios, including industry and countryspecific stress scenarios, as appropriate. The Firm uses 
stress testing to inform decisions on setting risk appetite 
both at a Firm and LOB level, as well as to assess the impact 
of stress on individual counterparties.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

Risk monitoring and management
The Firm has developed policies and practices that are 
designed to preserve the independence and integrity of the 
approval and decision-making process for extending credit 
so that credit risks are assessed accurately, approved 
properly, monitored regularly and managed actively at both 
the transaction and portfolio levels. The policy framework 
establishes credit approval authorities, concentration limits, 
risk-rating methodologies, portfolio review parameters and 
guidelines for management of distressed exposures. In 
addition, certain models, assumptions and inputs used in 
evaluating and monitoring credit risk are independently 
validated by groups that are separate from the LOBs.
Consumer credit risk is monitored for delinquency and 
other trends, including any concentrations at the portfolio 
level, as certain of these trends can be addressed through 
changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. 
Consumer Risk Management evaluates delinquency and 
other trends against business expectations, current and 
forecasted economic conditions, and industry benchmarks. 
Historical and forecasted economic performance and trends 
are incorporated into the modeling of estimated consumer 
credit losses and are part of the monitoring of the credit 
risk profile of the portfolio. 
Wholesale credit risk is monitored regularly at an aggregate 
portfolio, industry, and individual client and counterparty 
level with established concentration limits that are 
reviewed and revised periodically as deemed appropriate 
by management. Industry and counterparty limits, as 
measured in terms of exposure and economic risk appetite, 
are subject to stress-based loss constraints.
Management of the Firm’s wholesale credit risk exposure is 
accomplished through a number of means, including:
• Loan underwriting and credit approval processes
• Loan syndications and participations
• Loan sales and securitizations
• Credit derivatives
• Master netting agreements, and
• Collateral and other risk-reduction techniques
In addition to Credit Risk Management, an independent 
Credit Review function is responsible for: 
• Independently assessing risk grades assigned to 
exposures in the Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio and the 
timeliness of risk grade changes initiated by responsible 
business units; and 
• Evaluating the effectiveness of the credit management 
processes of the LOBs and Corporate, including the 
adequacy of credit analyses and risk grading/loss given 
default (“LGD”) rationales, proper monitoring and 
management of credit exposures, and compliance with 
applicable grading policies and underwriting guidelines. 
Refer to Note 12 for further discussion of consumer and 
wholesale loans.
Risk reporting
To enable monitoring of credit risk and effective decisionmaking, aggregate credit exposure, credit quality forecasts, 
concentration levels and risk profile changes are reported 
regularly to senior members of Credit Risk Management. 
Detailed portfolio reporting of industry, clients, 
counterparties and customers, product and geography are 
prepared, and the appropriateness of the allowance for 
credit losses is reviewed by senior management at least on 
a quarterly basis. Through the risk reporting and 
governance structure, credit risk trends and limit 
exceptions are provided regularly to, and discussed with, 
risk committees, senior management and the Board of 
Directors.

CREDIT PORTFOLIO
Credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change 
in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer.
In the following tables, total loans include loans retained 
(i.e., held-for-investment); loans held-for-sale; and certain 
loans accounted for at fair value. The following tables do 
not include loans which the Firm accounts for at fair value 
and classifies as trading assets; refer to Notes 2 and 3 for 
further information regarding these loans. Refer to Notes 
12, 28, and 5 for additional information on the Firm’s 
loans, lending-related commitments and derivative 
receivables, including the Firm’s related accounting 
policies. 
Refer to Note 10 for information regarding the credit risk 
inherent in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio; and 
refer to Note 11 for information regarding credit risk 
inherent in the securities financing portfolio. Refer to 
Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 114–119 and Note 12 
for further discussions of the consumer credit environment 
and consumer loans. Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio on 
pages 120–130 and Note 12 for further discussions of the 
wholesale credit environment and wholesale loans.
On January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted changes to the TDR 
accounting guidance, which eliminated the accounting and 
disclosure requirements for TDRs including the requirement 
to assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or 
involves a concession. The new guidance requires disclosure 
of loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial 
difficulty consisting of principal forgiveness, interest rate 
reduction, other-than-insignificant payment delay, term 
extension or a combination of these modifications. The Firm 
has defined these types of modifications as financial 
difficulty modifications ("FDMs"). As a result of the 
elimination of the requirement to assess whether a 
modification is reasonably expected or involves a 
concession, the population of loans considered FDMs differs 
from the population previously considered TDRs. Refer to 
Note 1 and Note 12 for further information.

Consumer, excluding credit card
Portfolio analysis
Loans increased from December 31, 2022 driven by 
residential real estate loans associated with First Republic 
and higher auto loans.
The following discussions provide information concerning 
individual loan products. Refer to Note 12 for further 
information about this portfolio, including information 
about delinquencies, loan modifications and other credit 
quality indicators.
Residential real estate: The residential real estate 
portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair 
value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and 
home equity lines of credit. 
Retained loans increased compared to December 31, 2022 
driven by residential real estate loans associated with First 
Republic. Retained nonaccrual loans decreased compared 
to December 31, 2022 predominantly driven by loan sales, 
partially offset by the net impact of paydowns and 
additions, including those associated with First Republic. 
Net recoveries were lower for the year ended December 31, 
2023 compared to the prior year driven by lower 
prepayments due to higher interest rates.
Loans at fair value increased from December 31, 2022, 
driven by an increase in Home Lending as originations 
outpaced warehouse loan sales, and in CIB as purchases 
outpaced sales and paydowns.
At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the carrying values of 
interest-only residential mortgage loans were $90.6 billion 
and $36.3 billion, respectively. The increase was driven by 
First Republic. These loans have an interest-only payment 
period generally followed by an adjustable-rate or fixedrate fully amortizing payment period to maturity and are 
typically originated as higher-balance loans to higherincome borrowers. The credit performance of this portfolio 
is comparable with the performance of the broader prime 
mortgage portfolio.
The carrying value of home equity lines of credit 
outstanding was $16.1 billion at December 31, 2023, 
which included $2.6 billion associated with First Republic. 
The carrying value of home equity lines of credit 
outstanding included $4.2 billion of HELOCs that have 
recast from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or 
have been modified and $4.3 billion of interest-only balloon 
HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm 
manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by 
closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent 
permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material 
deterioration in their credit risk profile.
The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s
 residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guarantee
d by U.S. government agencies, predominantly loans held-fo
r-sale and loans at fair value. The Firm monitors its exposur
e to certain potential unrecoverable claim payments relate
d to government-insured loans and considers this exposure in estimating the allowance for loan losses.

Geographic composition and current estimated loan-tovalue ratio of residential real estate loans
At December 31, 2023, $228.4 billion, or 70% of the total 
retained residential real estate loan portfolio, was 
concentrated in California, New York, Florida, Texas and 
Massachusetts, compared with $147.8 billion, or 62% at 
December 31, 2022.
Average current estimated loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios 
have improved, reflecting an increase in home prices.
Refer to Note 12 for information on the geographic 
composition and current estimated LTVs of the Firm’s 
residential real estate loans.
Modified residential real estate loans
For the year ended December 31, 2023, residential real 
estate FDMs were $136 million. In addition to FDMs, the 
Firm also had $69 million of loans subject to trial 
modification where the terms of the loans have not been 
permanently modified, as well as $9 million of loans subject 
to discharge under Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings 
("Chapter 7 loans"). The changes to the TDR accounting 
guidance eliminated the TDR reasonably expected and 
concession assessment criteria. Accordingly, trial 
modifications and Chapter 7 loans were considered TDRs, 
but not FDMs. Refer to Note 1 and Note 12 for further 
information.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, residential real 
estate TDRs were $362 million. Refer to Note 12 for further 
information on TDRs in prior periods.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio, 
including loans at fair value, generally consists of primequality scored auto and business banking loans, other 
consumer unsecured loans, and overdrafts. The portfolio 
increased when compared to December 31, 2022 due to 
originations of scored auto loans and an increase in other 
consumer unsecured fair value option loans in CIB 
associated with First Republic, largely offset by paydowns. 
Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2023 
increased compared to the prior year due to higher chargeoffs of scored auto loans driven by the decline in used 
vehicle valuations. The scored auto net charge-off rates 
were 0.56% and 0.24% for the years ended December 31, 
2023 and 2022, respectively.

Credit card
Total credit card loans increased from December 31, 2022 
reflecting growth from new accounts and revolving 
balances which continued to normalize to pre-pandemic 
levels. The December 31, 2023 30+ and 90+ day 
delinquency rates of 2.14% and 1.05%, respectively, 
increased compared to the December 31, 2022 30+ and 
90+ day delinquency rates of 1.45% and 0.68%, 
respectively. Net charge-offs increased for the year ended 
December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year as 
delinquencies have normalized.
Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans 
typically remain on accrual status until charged off. 
However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses includes the 
estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed 
interest and fee income. 
Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans
At December 31, 2023, $98.1 billion, or 46% of the total 
retained credit card loan portfolio, was concentrated in 
California, Texas, New York, Florida and Illinois, compared 
with $85.4 billion, or 46%, at December 31, 2022. 
Modifications of credit card loans
For the year ended December 31, 2023, credit card FDMs 
were $648 million. FDMs increased for the year ended 
December 31, 2023 compared to credit card TDRs in the 
prior year, as delinquencies have normalized. In addition to 
FDMs, the Firm also had $27 million of loans subject to trial 
modification where the terms of the loans have not been 
permanently modified for the year ended December 31, 
2023. The changes to the TDR accounting guidance 
eliminated the TDR reasonably expected and concession 
assessment criteria. Accordingly, trial modifications were 
considered TDRs, but not FDMs.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, credit card TDRs 
were $418 million. 
Refer to Note 1 and Note 12 for further information about 
this portfolio, including information about delinquencies, 
geographic and FICO composition, and modifications.

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO 
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit 
risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, marketmaking, and hedging activities with and for clients and 
counterparties, as well as through various operating 
services (such as cash management and clearing activities), 
securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. A 
portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s 
wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance 
sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the 
loans that it originates into the market as part of its 
syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio 
concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is 
actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth 
reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure, 
inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, 
product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry 
discussion on pages 122–125 for further information.
The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held 
in CIB, CB, AWM, and Corporate, and risk-rated exposure 
held in CCB, for which the wholesale methodology is applied 
when determining the allowance for loan losses. The Firm 
continues to convert certain operations, and to integrate 
clients, products and services, associated with First 
Republic. Accordingly, reporting classifications and internal 
risk rating profiles in the wholesale portfolio may change in 
future periods. Refer to Business Developments on page 53 
for additional information.
As of December 31, 2023, retained loans increased 
$68.8 billion predominantly driven by the impact of First 
Republic. Lending-related commitments increased 
$64.8 billion, driven by the impact of First Republic, and 
net portfolio activity in CIB and CB.
As of December 31, 2023, nonperforming exposure 
increased $476 million predominantly driven by 
nonperforming retained loans in Real Estate and 
Healthcare, reflecting downgrades, and Individuals largely 
driven by the impact of First Republic, partially offset by a 
single name upgrade in Civic Organizations.
For the year ended December 31, 2023, wholesale net 
charge-offs increased $698 million, predominantly driven 
by the restructuring of a loan, increases in Real Estate 
(concentrated in Office) and Consumer & Retail.

(b) These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP.
(c) The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference entity and the ratings profile shown is based on the ratings of the reference 
entity on which protection has been purchased. Predominantly all of the credit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased protection used 
in credit portfolio management activities are executed with investment-grade counterparties. In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection against 
certain loans in the retained loan portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes. 
(d) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is generally based on remaining contractual 
maturity. Derivative contracts that are in a receivable position at December 31, 2023, may become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow 
profile or changes in market conditions.

Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to industries 
with actual or potential credit concerns. Exposures that are deemed to be criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ 
definition of criticized exposures, which consist of the special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized 
exposure, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $41.4 billion at December 31, 2023 and $31.3 billion at 
December 31, 2022, representing approximately 3.3% and 2.7% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively; of the 
$41.4 billion, $38.3 billion was performing. The increase in criticized exposure was predominantly driven by Real Estate, 
Technology, Media & Telecommunications (predominantly Technology) and Healthcare, reflecting downgrades.
The table below summarizes by industry the Firm’s exposures as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The industry of risk 
category is generally based on the client or counterparty’s primary business activity. Refer to Note 4 for additional information

variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and 
institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. Refer to 
Note 12 for a further discussion on loans, including 
information about delinquencies, loan modifications and 
other credit quality indicators.

loan portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 
2022. Since December 31, 2022, nonaccrual loan exposure

Note 12 for further information. 
Wholesale TDRs were $801 million for the year ended

whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a 
concession, the population of loans considered FDMs is 
greater than the population previously considered TDRs. 
Refer to Note 12 for further information on TDRs in prior 
periods.

Lending-related commitments
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as 
commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and 
guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients. The 
contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent 
the maximum possible credit risk should the clients draw 
down on these commitments or when the Firm fulfills its 
obligations under these guarantees, and the clients 
subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these 
contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees have 
historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired 
without being drawn upon or a default occurring. As a result, 
the Firm does not believe that the total contractual amount of 
these wholesale lending-related commitments is 
representative of the Firm’s expected future credit exposure 
or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 for further 
information on wholesale lending-related commitments.
Receivables from customers
Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment 
margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that 
are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’ 
brokerage accounts (including cash on deposit, and primarily 
liquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities). To 
manage its credit risk, the Firm establishes margin 
requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an 
ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash 
or other collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. 
Credit risk arising from lending activities subject to collateral 
maintenance requirements is generally mitigated by factors 
such as the short-term nature of the activity, the fair value of 
collateral held and the Firm’s right to call for, and the 
borrower’s obligation to provide, additional margin when the 
fair value of the collateral declines. Because of these 
mitigating factors, these receivables generally do not require 
an allowance for credit losses. However, if in management’s 
judgment, an allowance for credit losses is required, the Firm 
estimates expected credit losses based on the value of the 
collateral and probability of borrower default. These 
receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts 
receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.
Refer to Note 13 for further information on the Firm’s 
accounting policies for the allowance for credit losses.
Derivative contracts
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risk, 
including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in 
interest rates, foreign exchange and equities and 
commodities prices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in 
order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage 
certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its 
market-making activities, including the counterparty credit 
risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses 
derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and 
other market risk exposure. The nature of the counterparty 
and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the 
credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For OTC derivatives, 
the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative 
counterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”), such 
as futures and options, and cleared over-the-counter (“OTCcleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to the 
credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible, the Firm seeks 
to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from derivative 
contracts through the use of legally enforceable master 
netting arrangements and collateral agreements. The 
percentage of the Firm’s OTC derivative transactions subject 
to collateral agreements — excluding foreign exchange spot 
trades, which are not typically covered by collateral 
agreements due to their short maturity and centrally cleared 
trades that are settled daily — was approximately 87% at 
both December 31, 2023 and 2022. Refer to Note 5 for 
additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral 
agreements and further discussion of derivative contracts, 
counterparties and settlement types.
The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the 
Consolidated balance sheets was $54.9 billion and $70.9 
billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The 
decrease was primarily as a result of market movements. 
Derivative receivables represent the fair value of the 
derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable 
master netting agreements and the related cash collateral 
held by the Firm.
In addition, the Firm holds liquid securities and other cash 
collateral that may be used as security when the fair value of 
the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor. For these 
purposes, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with 
the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the 
LCR rule.
In management’s view, the appropriate measure of current 
credit risk should also take into consideration other collateral, 
which generally represents securities that do not qualify as 
high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The benefits of 
these additional collateral amounts for each counterparty are 
subject to a legally enforceable master netting agreement and 
limited to the net amount of the derivative receivables for 
each counterparty.
The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 
government securities, other liquid government agency and 
guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity 
securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of 
transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that 
have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm 
has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the 
reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the 
receivables balances and is not included in the tables below, it 
is available as security against potential exposure that could 
arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative contracts 
move in the Firm’s favor. Refer to Note 5 for additional 
information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements for 
derivative transactions.

While useful as a current view of credit exposure, the net 
fair value of the derivative receivables does not capture the 
potential future variability of that credit exposure. To 
capture this variability, the Firm calculates, on a client-byclient basis, three measures of potential derivatives-related 
credit loss: Peak, Derivative Risk Equivalent (“DRE”), and 
Average exposure (“AVG”). These measures all incorporate 
netting and collateral benefits, where applicable.
Peak represents a conservative measure of potential 
derivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, to a 
counterparty calculated in a manner that is broadly 
equivalent to a 97.5% confidence level over the life of the 
transaction. Peak is the primary measure used by the Firm 
for setting credit limits for derivative contracts, senior 
management reporting and derivatives exposure 
management.
DRE exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of 
derivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, on a 
basis intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan 
exposures. DRE is a less extreme measure of potential 
credit loss than Peak and is used as an input for 
aggregating derivative credit risk exposures with loans and 
other credit risk.
Finally, AVG is a measure of the expected fair value of the 
Firm’s derivative exposures, including the benefit of 
collateral, at future time periods. AVG over the total life of 
the derivative contract is used as the primary metric for 
pricing purposes and is used to calculate credit risk capital 
and CVA, as further described below. 
The fair value of the Firm’s derivative receivables 
incorporates CVA to reflect the credit quality of 
counterparties. CVA is based on the Firm’s AVG to a 
counterparty and the counterparty’s credit spread in the 
credit derivatives market. The Firm believes that active risk 
management is essential to controlling the dynamic credit 
risk in the derivatives portfolio. In addition, the Firm’s risk 
management process for derivatives exposures takes into 
consideration the potential impact of wrong-way risk, which 
is broadly defined as the risk that exposure to a 
counterparty is positively correlated with the impact of a 
default by the same counterparty, which could cause 
exposure to increase at the same time as the counterparty’s 
capacity to meet its obligations is decreasing. Many factors 
may influence the nature and magnitude of these 
correlations over time. To the extent that these correlations 
are identified, the Firm may adjust the CVA associated with 
a particular counterparty’s AVG. The Firm risk manages 
exposure to changes in CVA by entering into credit 
derivative contracts, as well as interest rate, foreign 
exchange, equity and commodity derivative contracts.
The below graph shows exposure profiles to the Firm’s 
current derivatives portfolio over the next 10 years as 
calculated by the Peak, DRE and AVG metrics. The three 
measures generally show that exposure will decline after 
the first year, if no new trades are added to the portfolio.

Credit derivatives
The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: 
first, in its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an 
end-user to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated 
with various exposures.
Credit portfolio management activities
Included in the Firm’s end-user activities are credit 
derivatives used to mitigate the credit risk associated with 
traditional lending activities (loans and lending-related 
commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the 
Firm’s wholesale businesses (collectively, “credit portfolio 
management activities”). Information on credit portfolio 
management activities is provided in the table below. 
The Firm also uses credit derivatives as an end-user to 
manage other exposures, including credit risk arising from 
certain securities held in the Firm’s market-making 
businesses. These credit derivatives are not included in 
credit portfolio management activities.

The credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management 
activities do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. 
GAAP; these derivatives are reported at fair value, with 
gains and losses recognized in principal transactions 
revenue. In contrast, the loans and lending-related 
commitments being risk-managed are accounted for on an 
accrual basis. This asymmetry in accounting treatment, 
between loans and lending-related commitments and the 
credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management 
activities, causes earnings volatility that is not 
representative, in the Firm’s view, of the true changes in 
value of the Firm’s overall credit exposure.
The effectiveness of credit default swaps (“CDS”) as a hedge 
against the Firm’s exposures may vary depending on a 
number of factors, including the named reference entity 
(i.e., the Firm may experience losses on specific exposures 
that are different than the named reference entities in the 
purchased CDS); the contractual terms of the CDS (which 
may have a defined credit event that does not align with an 
actual loss realized by the Firm); and the maturity of the 
Firm’s CDS protection (which in some cases may be shorter 
than the Firm’s exposures). However, the Firm generally 
seeks to purchase credit protection with a maturity date 
that is the same or similar to the maturity date of the 
exposure for which the protection was purchased, and 
remaining differences in maturity are actively monitored 
and managed by the Firm. Refer to Credit derivatives in 
Note 5 for further information on credit derivatives and 
derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents 
management's estimate of expected credit losses over the 
remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets 
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet 
lending-related commitments. The Firm’s allowance for 
credit losses generally consists of:
• the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s 
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is 
presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,
• the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is 
reflected in accounts payable and other liabilities on the 
Consolidated balance sheets, and 
• the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, 
which is reflected in investment securities on the 
Consolidated balance sheets.
Discussion of changes in the allowance
The allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2023 
was $24.8 billion, reflecting a net addition of $3.1 billion 
from December 31, 2022.
The net addition to the allowance for credit losses included 
$1.9 billion, consisting of:
• $1.3 billion in consumer, predominantly driven by CCB, 
comprised of $1.4 billion in Card Services, partially offset 
by a net reduction of $200 million in Home Lending. The 
net addition in Card Services was driven by loan growth, 
including an increase in revolving balances, partially 
offset by reduced borrower uncertainty. The net 
reduction in Home Lending was driven by improvements 
in the outlook for home prices, and 
• $675 million in wholesale, driven by net downgrade 
activity, the net effect of changes in the Firm’s weighted 
average macroeconomic outlook, including deterioration 
in the outlook for commercial real estate in CB, and an 
addition for certain accounts receivable in CIB, partially 
offset by the impact of changes in the loan and lendingrelated commitment portfolios.
The net addition also included $1.2 billion to establish the 
allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related 
commitments in the second quarter of 2023. 
The changes in the Firm's weighted average macroeconomic 
outlook also included updates to the central scenario in the 
third quarter of 2023 to reflect a lower forecasted 
unemployment rate consistent with a higher growth rate in 
GDP, and the impact of the additional weight placed on the 
adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023, reflecting 
elevated recession risks due to high inflation and tightening 
financial conditions. 
The allowance for credit losses also reflected a reduction of 
$587 million as a result of the adoption of changes to the 
TDR accounting guidance on January 1, 2023. Refer to Note 
1 for further information.
The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a 
weighted average of five internally developed 
macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios 
incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the 
central case assumptions provided in the table below, 
resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate 
peaking at 5.5% in the fourth quarter of 2024, and a 
weighted average U.S. real GDP level that is 1.5% lower 
than the central case at the end of the second quarter of 
2025.

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT 
Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss 
of principal or a reduction in expected returns on 
investments arising from the investment securities portfolio 
or from principal investments. The investment securities 
portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in 
connection with the Firm's balance sheet and asset-liability 
management objectives. Principal investments are 
predominantly privately-held financial instruments and are 
managed in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are 
typically intended to be held over extended periods and, 
accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term 
realized gains with respect to these investments.
Investment securities risk 
Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated 
with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This 
risk is mitigated given that the investment securities 
portfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly consists 
of high-quality securities. At December 31, 2023, the 
Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of the 
allowance for credit losses, was $569.2 billion, and the 
average credit rating of the securities comprising the 
portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where 
available, and where not available, based primarily upon 
internal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on 
pages 84–85 and Note 10 for further information on the 
investment securities portfolio and internal risk ratings. 
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 102–109 for 
further information on related liquidity risk. Refer to Market 
Risk Management on pages 135–143 for further 
information on the market risk inherent in the portfolio.
Governance and oversight
Investment securities risks are governed by the Firm’s Risk 
Appetite framework, and reviewed at the CTC Risk 
Committee with regular updates provided to the Board Risk 
Committee. 
The Firm’s independent control functions are responsible 
for reviewing the appropriateness of the carrying value of 
investment securities in accordance with relevant policies. 
Approved levels for investment securities are established 
for each risk category, including capital and credit risks.
Principal investment risk 
Principal investments are typically privately-held financial 
instruments representing ownership interests or other 
forms of junior capital. In general, principal investments 
include tax-oriented investments and investments made to 
enhance or accelerate the Firm’s business strategies and 
exclude those that are consolidated on the Firm's balance 
sheets. These investments are made by dedicated investing 
businesses or as part of a broader business strategy. The 
Firm’s principal investments are managed by the LOBs and 
Corporate and are reflected within their respective financial 
results. The Firm’s investments will continue to evolve 
based on market circumstances and in line with its strategic 
initiatives, including the Firm’s environmental and social 
goals.

Governance and oversight
The Firm’s approach to managing principal investment risk 
is consistent with the Firm’s risk governance structure. The 
Firm has established a Firmwide risk policy framework for 
all principal investing activities that includes approval by 
executives who are independent from the investing 
businesses, as appropriate.
The Firm’s independent control functions are responsible 
for reviewing the appropriateness of the carrying value of 
investments in accordance with relevant policies. As part of 
the risk governance structure, approved levels for 
investments are established and monitored for each 
relevant business or segment in order to manage the 
overall size of the portfolios. The Firm also conducts stress 
testing on these portfolios using specific scenarios that 
estimate losses based on significant market moves and/or 
other risk events.
Management’s discussion and analysis

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT
Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes 
in market factors such as interest and foreign exchange 
rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or 
implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held 
for both the short and long term. 
Market Risk Management
Market Risk Management monitors market risks throughout 
the Firm and defines market risk policies and procedures. 
Market Risk Management seeks to manage risk, facilitate 
efficient risk/return decisions, reduce volatility in operating 
performance and provide transparency into the Firm’s 
market risk profile for senior management, the Board of 
Directors and regulators. Market Risk Management is 
responsible for the following functions:
• Maintaining a market risk policy framework
• Independently measuring, monitoring and controlling 
LOB, Corporate, and Firmwide market risk
• Defining, approving and monitoring limits
• Performing stress testing and qualitative risk 
assessments
Risk measurement
Measures used to capture market risk 
There is no single measure to capture market risk and 
therefore Market Risk Management uses various metrics, 
both statistical and nonstatistical, to assess risk including:
• Value-at-risk 
• Stress testing
• Profit and loss drawdowns 
• Earnings-at-risk
• Economic Value Sensitivity
• Other sensitivity-based measures
Risk monitoring and control 
Market risk exposure is managed primarily through a series 
of limits set in the context of the market environment and 
business strategy. In setting limits, Market Risk 
Management takes into consideration factors such as 
market volatility, product liquidity, accommodation of client 
business, and management judgment. Market Risk 
Management maintains different levels of limits. Firm level 
limits include VaR and stress limits. Similarly, LOB and 
Corporate limits include VaR and stress limits and may be 
supplemented by certain nonstatistical risk measures such 
as profit and loss drawdowns. Limits may also be set within 
the LOBs and Corporate, as well as at the legal entity level.
Market Risk Management sets limits and regularly reviews 
and updates them as appropriate. Senior management is 
responsible for reviewing and approving certain of these 
risk limits on an ongoing basis. Limits that have not been 
reviewed within specified time periods by Market Risk 
Management are reported to senior management. The LOBs 
and Corporate are responsible for adhering to established 
limits against which exposures are monitored and reported.
Limit breaches are required to be reported in a timely 
manner to limit approvers, which include Market Risk 
Management and senior management. In the event of a 
breach, Market Risk Management consults with senior 
members of appropriate groups within the Firm to 
determine the suitable course of action required to return 
the applicable positions to compliance, which may include a 
reduction in risk in order to remedy the breach or granting 
a temporary increase in limits to accommodate an expected 
increase in client activity and/or market volatility. Firm, 
Corporate or LOB-level limit breaches are escalated as 
appropriate.
Models used to measure market risk are inherently 
imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure certain 
risks or to predict losses. This imprecision may be 
heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market 
conditions occur. For additional discussion on model 
uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk 
Management on page 154.
Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s 
existing market risk measures to identify opportunities for 
enhancement, and to the extent appropriate, will calibrate 
those measures accordingly over time.

Management’s discussion and analysis

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

Value-at-risk
JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a statistical 
risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse 
market moves in the current market environment. The Firm 
has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating 
Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR.
The framework is employed across the Firm using historical 
simulation based on data for the previous 12 months. The 
framework’s approach assumes that historical changes in 
market values are representative of the distribution of 
potential outcomes in the immediate future. The Firm 
believes the use of Risk Management VaR provides a daily 
measure of risk that is closely aligned to risk management 
decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate and, along with 
other market risk measures, provides the appropriate 
information needed to respond to risk events. 
The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a 
one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss 
methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level. 
Risk Management VaR provides a consistent framework to 
measure risk profiles and levels of diversification across 
product types and is used for aggregating risks and 
monitoring limits across businesses. VaR results are 
reported as appropriate to various groups including senior 
management, the Board Risk Committee and regulators. 
Underlying the overall VaR model framework are individual 
VaR models that simulate historical market returns for 
individual risk factors and/or product types. To capture 
material market risks as part of the Firm’s risk management 
framework, comprehensive VaR model calculations are 
performed daily for businesses whose activities give rise to 
market risk. These VaR models are granular and 
incorporate numerous risk factors and inputs to simulate 
daily changes in market values over the historical period; 
inputs are selected based on the risk profile of each 
portfolio, as sensitivities and historical time series used to 
generate daily market values may be different across 
product types or risk management systems. The VaR model 
results across all portfolios are aggregated at the Firm 
level.
As VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect 
measure of market risk exposure and potential future 
losses. In addition, based on their reliance on available 
historical data, limited time horizons, and other factors, 
VaR measures are inherently limited in their ability to 
measure certain risks and to predict losses, particularly 
those associated with market illiquidity and sudden or 
severe shifts in market conditions. 
For certain products, specific risk parameters are not 
captured in VaR due to the lack of liquidity and availability 
of appropriate historical data. The Firm uses proxies to 
estimate the VaR for these and other products when daily 
time series are not available. It is likely that using an actual 
price-based time series for these products, if available, 
would affect the VaR results presented. The Firm therefore 
considers other nonstatistical measures such as stress 
testing, in addition to VaR, to capture and manage its 
market risk positions. 
As VaR model calculations require daily data and a 
consistent source for valuation, the daily market data used 
may be different than the independent third-party data 
collected for VCG price testing in its monthly valuation 
process. For example, in cases where market prices are not 
observable, or where proxies are used in VaR historical time 
series, the data sources may differ. Refer to Valuation 
process in Note 2 for further information on the Firm’s 
valuation process. 
The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically 
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the 
composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market 
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling 
techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such 
changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results. 
Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 
154 for information regarding model reviews and 
approvals.
The Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR in 
accordance with regulatory rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which 
is used to derive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital 
requirements under Basel III capital rules. This Regulatory 
VaR model framework currently assumes a ten business-day 
holding period and an expected tail loss methodology which 
approximates a 99% confidence level. Regulatory VaR is 
applied to “covered” positions as defined by Basel III capital 
rules, which may be different than the positions included in 
the Firm’s Risk Management VaR. For example, credit 
derivative hedges of accrual loans are included in the Firm’s 
Risk Management VaR, while Regulatory VaR excludes these 
credit derivative hedges. In addition, in contrast to the 
Firm’s Risk Management VaR, Regulatory VaR currently 
excludes the diversification benefit for certain VaR models.
Refer to JPMorgan Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory 
Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the 
Firm’s website, for additional information on Regulatory 
VaR and the other components of market risk regulatory 
capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed 
VaR-based measure and the respective backtesting).

(a) Diversification benefit represents the difference between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its individual components. This reflects the non-additive nature 
of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and risk types. For maximum and minimum VaR, diversification benefit is not meaningful as 
the maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components.
(b) Credit Portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained loan portfolio, which are reported in principal transactions 
revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value. In line with the Firm's internal model governance, the 
credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening of the credit spreads for those 
counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also removed to maintain consistency. This exposure is now reflected in other sensitivity-based 
measures.
(c) Corporate and other LOB VaR includes a legacy private equity position in Corporate which is publicly traded.
(d) In March 2022, the effects of nickel price increases and the associated volatility in the nickel market resulted in elevated maximum Credit Portfolio VaR, as 
well as maximum Total VaR.
2023 compared with 2022
Average Total VaR decreased by $15 million for the year 
ended December 31, 2023 when compared with the prior 
year.
The decrease was driven by reduced market volatility and 
risk reductions predominantly impacting fixed income, 
commodities and equities.

VaR backtesting
The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which 
compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the 
daily gains and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting 
purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below 
do not reflect the Firm’s reported revenue as they exclude 
certain components of total net revenue, such as those 
associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., 
intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk 
management activities), fees, commissions, other valuation 
adjustments and net interest income. These excluded 
components of total net revenue may more than offset the 
backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The definition 
of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the 
requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.
A backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting 
loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior 
day. Under the Firm’s Risk Management VaR methodology, 
assuming current changes in market values are consistent 
with the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm 
would expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions five times 
every 100 trading days on average. The number of VaR 
backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the 
statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if 
the current level of market volatility is materially different 
from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of 
historical data used in the VaR calculation.
For the 12 months ended December 31, 2023, the Firm 
posted backtesting gains on 139 of the 258 days, and 
observed 13 VaR backtesting exceptions, of which eight 
were in the three months ended December 31, 2023. 
Firmwide backtesting loss days can differ from the loss days 
for which Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets posted 
losses, as disclosed in CIB Markets revenue, as the 
population of positions which comprise each metric are 
different and due to the exclusion of certain components of 
total net revenue in backtesting gains and losses as 
described above. 
The following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide 
daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12 months 
and three months ended December 31, 2023. The daily 
backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the 
corresponding daily Risk Management VaR. The count of 
days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty 
percentage point intervals. Backtesting exceptions are 
displayed within the intervals that are greater than one 
hundred percent. The results in the chart below differ from 
the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk 
section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital 
Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR 
applied to the Firm’s covered positions.

Other risk measures 
Stress testing 
Along with VaR, stress testing is an important tool used to 
assess risk. While VaR reflects the risk of loss due to 
adverse changes in markets using recent historical market 
behavior, stress testing reflects the risk of loss from 
hypothetical changes in the value of market risk sensitive 
positions applied simultaneously. Stress testing measures 
the Firm’s vulnerability to losses under a range of stressed 
but possible economic and market scenarios. The results 
are used to understand the exposures responsible for those 
potential losses and are measured against limits. 
The Firm’s stress framework covers market risk sensitive 
positions in the LOBs and Corporate. The framework is used 
to calculate multiple magnitudes of potential stress for both 
market rallies and market sell-offs, assuming significant 
changes in market factors such as credit spreads, equity 
prices, interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, 
and combines them in multiple ways to capture an array of 
hypothetical economic and market scenarios. 
The Firm generates a number of scenarios that focus on tail 
events in specific asset classes and geographies, including 
how the event may impact multiple market factors 
simultaneously. Scenarios also incorporate specific 
idiosyncratic risks and stress basis risk between different 
products. The flexibility in the stress framework allows the 
Firm to construct new scenarios that can test the outcomes 
against possible future stress events. Stress testing results 
are reported periodically to senior management of the 
Firm, as appropriate. 
Stress scenarios are governed by the overall stress 
framework, under the oversight of Market Risk 
Management, and the models to calculate the stress results 
are subject to the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk 
Management Policy. The Firmwide Market Risk Stress 
Methodology Committee reviews and approves changes to 
stress testing methodology and scenarios across the Firm. 
Significant changes to the framework are escalated to 
senior management, as appropriate. 
The Firm’s stress testing framework is utilized in calculating 
the Firm’s CCAR and other stress test results, which are 
reported periodically to the Board of Directors. In addition, 
stress testing results are incorporated into the Firm’s Risk 
Appetite framework, and are reported periodically to the 
Board Risk Committee. 
Profit and loss drawdowns 
Profit and loss drawdowns are used to highlight trading 
losses above certain levels of risk tolerance. A profit and 
loss drawdown is a decline in revenue from its year-to-date 
peak level.
Structural interest rate risk management 
The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported 
net income is important as interest rate risk represents one 
of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk 
arises not only from trading activities which are included in 
VaR, but also from the Firm’s traditional banking activities, 
which include extension of loans and credit facilities, taking 
deposits, issuing debt, as well as the investment securities 
portfolio, and associated derivative instruments. Refer to 
the table on page 136 for a summary by LOB and Corporate 
identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk.
Governance
The CTC Risk Committee establishes the Firm’s interest rate 
risk management policy and related limits, which are 
subject to approval by the Board Risk Committee. Treasury 
and CIO, working in partnership with the LOBs, calculates 
the Firm’s structural interest rate risk profile and reviews it 
with senior management, including the CTC Risk Committee. 
In addition, oversight of structural interest rate risk is 
managed through a dedicated risk function reporting to the 
CTC CRO. This risk function is responsible for providing 
independent oversight and governance around assumptions 
and establishing and monitoring limits for structural 
interest rate risk, including limits related to Earnings-atRisk and Economic Value Sensitivity. The Firm manages 
structural interest rate risk generally through its investment 
securities portfolio and interest rate derivatives.
Key Risk Drivers and Risk Management Process
Structural interest rate risk can arise due to a variety of 
factors, including:
• Differences in timing among the maturity or repricing of 
assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments
• Differences in the amounts of assets, liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments that are maturing or repricing 
at the same time
• Differences in the amounts by which short-term and longterm market interest rates change (for example, changes 
in the slope of the yield curve)
• The impact of changes in the maturity of various assets, 
liabilities or off-balance sheet instruments as interest 
rates change
The Firm manages interest rate exposure related to its 
assets and liabilities on a consolidated, Firmwide basis. 
Business units transfer their interest rate risk to Treasury 
and CIO through funds transfer pricing, which takes into 
account the elements of interest rate exposure that can be 
risk-managed in financial markets. These elements include 
asset and liability balances and contractual rates of 
interest, contractual principal payment schedules, expected 
prepayment experience, interest rate reset dates and 
maturities, rate indices used for repricing, and any interest 
rate ceilings or floors for adjustable rate products.
Earnings-at-Risk
One way that the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate 
risk is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates 
the Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate 
scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which 
includes net interest income and certain interest rate 
sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and, 
Management’s discussion and analysis

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm 
conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest 
rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. 
dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). 
These simulations primarily include retained loans, 
deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, longterm debt and any related interest rate hedges, and funds 
transfer pricing of other positions in risk management VaR 
and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page 
136. These simulations exclude hedges of exposure from 
non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk arising from the 
Firm’s capital investments. The inclusion of the hedges in 
these simulations would increase U.S. dollar sensitivities 
and decrease non-U.S. dollar sensitivities. Refer to non-U.S. 
dollar foreign exchange risk on page 145 for more 
information.
Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to 
a net interest income baseline over the following 12 months 
utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios include a 
parallel shift involving changes to both short-term and longterm rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield curve 
involving holding short-term rates constant and increasing 
long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve involving 
increasing short-term rates and holding long-term rates 
constant or holding short-term rates constant and 
decreasing long-term rates. These scenarios consider many 
different factors, including: 
• The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous 
changes in interest rates from baseline rates.
• Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled 
prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding 
assumptions about actions that could be taken by the 
Firm or its clients and customers in response to 
instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment 
assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the 
scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates, 
the time since origination, and other factors which are 
updated periodically based on historical experience. 
Deposit forecasts are a key assumption in the Firm’s 
earnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects certain 
assumptions relating to the reversal of Quantitative 
Easing that are highly uncertain and require management 
judgment. Therefore, the actual amount of deposits held 
by the Firm at any particular time could be impacted by 
actions the Federal Reserve may take as part of monetary 
policy, including through the use of the Reverse 
Repurchase Facility. In addition, there are other factors 
that impact the amount of deposits held at the Firm such 
as the level of loans across the industry and competition 
for deposits.
• The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit 
betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates paid 
could change upon a given change in market interest 
rates. As part of the Firm's continuous evaluation and 
periodic enhancements to its earnings-at-risk 
calculations, the Firm updated its model in the second 
quarter of 2023 to incorporate deposit repricing lags 
impacting both consumer and wholesale deposits. The 
model change incorporated observed pricing and 
customer behavior in both rising and falling interest rate 
environments. Actual deposit rates paid may differ from 
the modeled assumptions, primarily due to customer 
behavior and competition for deposits.
The Firm performs sensitivity analyses of the assumptions 
used in earnings-at-risk scenarios, including with respect to 
deposit betas and forecasts of deposit balances, both of 
which are especially significant in the case of consumer 
deposits. The results of these sensitivity analyses are 
reported to the CTC Risk Committee and the Board Risk 
Committee.
The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically 
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the 
composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market 
conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and 
other factors. While a relevant measure of the Firm’s 
interest rate exposure, the earnings-at-risk analysis does 
not represent a forecast of the Firm’s net interest income 
(Refer to Outlook on page 52 for additional information).
The Firm’s U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar sensitivities are 
presented in the table below.

(b) Reflects the simultaneous shift of U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar rates.
In the absence of the model update to incorporate deposit 
repricing lags in the second quarter of 2023, the Firm's U.S. 
dollar sensitivities as of December 31, 2023, would have 
been lower by $4.1 billion to the +100 basis points shift in 
short-term and parallel rate scenarios and higher by $3.7 
billion to the -100 basis points shift in short-term and 
parallel rate scenarios.
The change in the Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities as of 
December 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022 also 
reflected the impact of changes in the Firm’s balance sheet 
including the impact of the First Republic acquisition.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

As of December 31, 2023, the Firm’s sensitivity to a 
parallel shift in rates is primarily the result of a greater 
impact from assets repricing compared to the impact of 
liabilities repricing. 
Economic Value Sensitivity 
In addition to earnings-at-risk, which is measured as a 
sensitivity to a baseline of earnings over the next 12 
months, the Firm also measures Economic Value Sensitivity 
(“EVS”). EVS stress tests the longer-term economic value of 
equity by measuring the sensitivity of the Firm’s current 
balance sheet, primarily retained loans, deposits, debt and 
investment securities as well as related hedges, under 
various interest rate scenarios. In accordance with the CTC 
interest rate risk management policy, the Firm has 
established limits on EVS as a percentage of TCE. Additional 
information on long-term debt and held to maturity 
investment securities is disclosed on page 195 in Note 2 
financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on 
the Consolidated balance sheets.

Non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk 
Non-U.S. dollar FX risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates affect the value of the Firm’s assets or liabilities or 
future results. The Firm has structural non-U.S. dollar FX exposures arising from capital investments, forecasted expense and 
revenue, the investment securities portfolio and non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt issuance. Treasury and CIO, working in 
partnership with the LOBs, primarily manage these risks on behalf of the Firm. Treasury and CIO may hedge certain of these 
risks using derivatives. Refer to Business Segment Results on page 66 for additional information.
Other sensitivity-based measures
The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by assessing the 
potential impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to changes in relevant 
market variables. Refer to the predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on page 136 for additional 
information on the positions captured in other sensitivity-based measures.
The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk sensitive 
instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for hedging purposes are 
reported net of the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may not be representative of the 
actual gain or loss that would have been realized at December 31, 2023 and 2022, as the movement in market parameters 
across maturities may vary and are not intended to imply management’s expectation of future changes in these sensitivities.

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT
The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed 
to country risk resulting from financial, economic, political 
or other significant developments which adversely affect 
the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a particular 
country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management 
group actively monitors the various portfolios which may be 
impacted by these developments and measures the extent 
to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified given the 
Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.
Organization and management
Country Risk Management is an independent risk 
management function that assesses, manages and monitors 
exposure to country risk across the Firm. 
The Firm’s country risk management function includes the 
following activities:
Maintaining policies, procedures and standards 
consistent with a comprehensive country risk framework
Assigning sovereign ratings, assessing country risks and 
establishing risk tolerance relative to a country
Measuring and monitoring country risk exposure and 
stress across the Firm
Managing and approving country limits and reporting 
trends and limit breaches to senior management
Developing surveillance tools, such as signaling models 
and ratings indicators, for early identification of 
potential country risk concerns
Providing country risk scenario analysis
Sources and measurement
The Firm is exposed to country risk through its lending and 
deposits, investing, and market-making activities, whether 
cross-border or locally funded. Country exposure includes 
activity with both government and private-sector entities in 
a country. 
Under the Firm’s internal country risk management 
approach, attribution of exposure to an individual country is 
based on the country where the largest proportion of the 
assets of the counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor are 
located or where the largest proportion of its revenue is 
derived, which may be different than the domicile (i.e. legal 
residence) or country of incorporation. 
Individual country exposures reflect an aggregation of the 
Firm’s risk to an immediate default, with zero recovery, of 
the counterparties, issuers, obligors or guarantors 
attributed to that country. Activities which result in 
contingent or indirect exposure to a country are not 
included in the country exposure measure (for example, 
providing clearing services or secondary exposure to 
collateral on securities financing receivables).
Assumptions are sometimes required in determining the 
measurement and allocation of country exposure, 
particularly in the case of certain non-linear or index 
products, or where the nature of the counterparty, issuer, 
obligor or guarantor is not suitable for attribution to an 
individual country. The use of different measurement 
approaches or assumptions could affect the amount of 
reported country exposure.
Under the Firm’s internal country risk measurement 
framework:
Deposits with banks are measured as the cash balances 
placed with central banks, commercial banks, and other 
financial institutions
Lending exposures are measured at the total committed 
amount (funded and unfunded), net of the allowance for 
credit losses and eligible cash and marketable securities 
collateral received
Securities financing exposures are measured at their 
receivable balance, net of eligible collateral received
Debt and equity securities are measured at the fair value 
of all positions, including both long and short positions
Counterparty exposure on derivative receivables is 
measured at the derivative’s fair value, net of the fair 
value of the eligible collateral received
Credit derivatives exposure is measured at the net 
notional amount of protection purchased or sold for the 
same underlying reference entity, inclusive of the fair 
value of the derivative receivable or payable, reflecting 
the manner in which the Firm manages these exposures
The Firm’s internal country risk reporting differs from the 
reporting provided under the FFIEC bank regulatory 
requirements.
Management’s discussion and analysis

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

Stress testing
Stress testing is an important component of the Firm’s 
country risk management framework, which aims to 
estimate and limit losses arising from a country crisis by 
measuring the impact of adverse asset price movements to 
a country based on market shocks combined with 
counterparty specific assumptions. Country Risk 
Management periodically designs and runs tailored stress 
scenarios to test vulnerabilities to individual countries or 
sets of countries in response to specific or potential market 
events, sector performance concerns, sovereign actions and 
geopolitical risks. These tailored stress results are used to 
inform potential risk reduction across the Firm, as 
necessary.
Risk reporting
Country exposure and stress are measured and reported 
regularly, and used by Country Risk Management to identify 
trends and monitor high usages and breaches against limits. 
For country risk management purposes, the Firm may 
report exposure to jurisdictions that are not fully 
autonomous, including Special Administrative Regions 
(“SAR”) and dependent territories, separately from the 
independent sovereign states with which they are 
associated.
The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by 
country (excluding the U.S.) as of December 31, 2023, and 
their comparative exposures as of December 31, 2022. The 
top 20 country exposures represent the Firm’s largest total 
exposures by individual country. Country exposures may 
fluctuate from period to period due to a variety of factors, 
including client activity, market flows and liquidity 
management activities undertaken by the Firm. 
The decrease in exposure to Japan when compared to 
December 31, 2022, was driven by a reduction in cash 
placed with the central bank of Japan as a result of liquidity 
management activities undertaken by the Firm.
The decrease in exposure to Australia when compared to 
December 31, 2022, was predominantly driven by a 
reduction in cash placed with the central bank of Australia 
due to client-driven activities resulting from changes in 
interest rates. 
The Firm continues to monitor its exposure to Russia which 
was approximately $350 million as of December 31, 2023. 
This amount excludes certain deposits placed on behalf of 
clients at the Depository Insurance Agency of Russia.

CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT
Climate risk is the risk associated with the impacts of 
climate change on the Firm’s clients, customers, operations 
and business strategy. Climate change is viewed as a driver 
of risk that may impact existing types of risks managed by 
the Firm. Climate risk is categorized into physical risk and 
transition risk.
Physical risk refers to economic costs and financial loss 
associated with a changing climate. Acute physical risk 
drivers include the increased frequency or severity of 
climate and weather events, such as floods, wildfires and 
tropical cyclones. Chronic physical risk drivers include more 
gradual shifts in the climate, such as sea level rise, 
persistent changes in precipitation levels and increases in 
average ambient temperatures.
Transition risk refers to the financial and economic 
implications associated with a societal adjustment to a lowcarbon economy. Transition risk drivers include possible 
changes in public policy, adoption of new technologies and 
shifts in consumer preferences. Transition risks may also be 
influenced by changes in the physical climate.
Organization and management
The Firm has a Climate Risk Management function that is 
responsible for establishing and maintaining the Firmwide 
framework and strategy for managing climate risks that 
may impact the Firm. The Climate Risk Management 
function engages across the Firm to help integrate climate 
risk considerations into existing risk management 
frameworks, as appropriate.
Other responsibilities of Climate Risk Management include:
Setting policies, standards, procedures and processes to 
support identification, escalation, monitoring and 
management of climate risk across the Firm
Developing metrics, scenarios and stress testing 
mechanisms designed to assess the range of potential 
climate-related financial and economic impacts to the 
Firm
Establishing a Firmwide climate risk data strategy and 
the supporting climate risk technology infrastructure
The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the 
identification, assessment and management of climate risks 
present in their business activities and for adherence to 
applicable climate-related laws, rules and regulations.
Governance and oversight
The Firm’s approach to managing climate risk is consistent 
with the Firm’s risk governance structure. The LOBs and 
Corporate are responsible for integrating climate risk 
management into existing governance frameworks, or 
creating new governance frameworks, as appropriate.
The LOBs, Corporate and Climate Risk Management are 
responsible for providing the Board Risk Committee with 
information on significant climate risks and climate-related 
initiatives, as appropriate.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting 
from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems; 
human factors; or external events impacting the Firm’s 
processes or systems. Operational Risk includes 
compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk. 
Operational risk is inherent in the Firm’s activities and can 
manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts, 
business disruptions (including those caused by 
extraordinary events beyond the Firm's control), cyber 
attacks, inappropriate employee behavior, failure to comply 
with applicable laws, rules and regulations or failure of 
vendors or other third party providers to perform in 
accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk 
Management attempts to manage operational risk at 
appropriate levels in light of the Firm’s financial position, 
the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and 
regulatory environments in which it operates. 
Operational Risk Management Framework
The Firm’s Compliance, Conduct, and Operational Risk 
(“CCOR”) Management Framework is designed to enable 
the Firm to govern, identify, measure, monitor and test, 
manage and report on the Firm’s operational risk. 
Operational Risk Governance
The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the 
management of operational risk. The Control Management 
Organization, which consists of control managers within 
each LOB and Corporate, is responsible for the day-to-day 
execution of the CCOR Framework. 
The Firm’s Global Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”) and FRE 
for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite is 
responsible for defining the CCOR Management Framework 
and establishing the minimum standards for its execution. 
The LOB and Corporate aligned CCOR Lead Officers report 
to the Global CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and 
Qualitative Risk Appetite and are independent of the 
respective businesses or functions they oversee. The CCOR 
Management Framework is included in the Risk Governance 
and Oversight Policy that is reviewed and approved by the 
Board Risk Committee periodically.
Operational Risk Identification
The Firm utilizes a structured risk and control selfassessment process that is executed by the LOBs and 
Corporate. As part of this process, the LOBs and Corporate 
evaluate the effectiveness of their respective control 
environment to assess circumstances in which controls have 
failed, and to determine where remediation efforts may be 
required. The Firm’s Operational Risk and Compliance 
organization (“Operational Risk and Compliance”) provides 
oversight of and challenge to these evaluations and may 
also perform independent assessments of significant 
operational risk events and areas of concentrated or 
emerging risk.
Operational Risk Measurement
Operational Risk and Compliance performs an independent 
assessment of the operational risks inherent within the 
LOBs and Corporate, which includes evaluating the 
effectiveness of the control environments and reporting the 
results to senior management.
In addition, Operational Risk and Compliance assesses 
operational risks through quantitative means, including 
operational risk-based capital and estimation of operational 
risk losses under both baseline and stressed conditions. 
The primary component of the operational risk-based 
capital estimate is the Loss Distribution Approach (“LDA”) 
statistical model, which simulates the projected frequency 
and severity of operational risk losses based on historical 
data. The LDA model is used to estimate an aggregate 
operational risk loss over a one-year time horizon, at a 
99.9% confidence level. The LDA model incorporates actual 
internal operational risk losses in the quarter following the 
period in which those losses were realized, and the 
calculation generally continues to reflect such losses even 
after the issues or business activities giving rise to the 
losses have been remediated or reduced.
As required under the Basel III capital framework, the 
Firm’s operational risk capital methodology, which uses the 
Advanced Measurement Approach (“AMA”), incorporates 
internal and external losses as well as management’s view 
of tail risk captured through operational risk scenario 
analysis, and evaluation of key business environment and 
internal control metrics. The Firm does not reflect the 
impact of insurance in its AMA estimate of operational risk 
capital. 
The Firm considers the impact of stressed economic 
conditions on operational risk losses and develops a 
forward looking view of material operational risk events 
that may occur in a stressed environment. The Firm’s 
operational risk stress testing framework is utilized in 
calculating results for the Firm’s CCAR and other stress 
testing processes. 
Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 91-101 for 
information related to operational risk RWA, and CCAR.
Operational Risk Monitoring and testing
The results of risk assessments performed by Operational 
Risk and Compliance are used in connection with their 
independent monitoring and testing compliance of the LOBs 
and Corporate with laws, rules and regulations. Through 
monitoring and testing, Operational Risk and Compliance 
independently identify areas of heightened operational risk 
and tests the effectiveness of controls within the LOBs and 
Corporate. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

Management of Operational Risk
The operational risk areas or issues identified through 
monitoring and testing are escalated to the LOBs and 
Corporate to be remediated through action plans, as 
needed, to mitigate operational risk. Operational Risk and 
Compliance may advise the LOBs and Corporate in the 
development and implementation of action plans.
Operational Risk Reporting
All employees of the Firm are expected to escalate risks 
appropriately. Risks identified by Operational Risk and 
Compliance are escalated to the appropriate LOB and 
Corporate Control Committees, as needed. Operational Risk 
and Compliance has established standards designed to 
ensure that consistent operational risk reporting and 
operational risk reports are produced on a Firmwide basis 
as well as by the LOBs and Corporate. Reporting includes 
the evaluation of key risk and performance indicators 
against established thresholds as well as the assessment of 
different types of operational risk against stated risk 
appetite. The standards establish escalation protocols to 
senior management and to the Board of Directors.
Insurance
One of the ways in which operational risk may be mitigated 
is through insurance maintained by the Firm. The Firm 
purchases insurance from commercial insurers and 
maintains a wholly-owned captive insurer, Park Assurance 
Company. Insurance may also be required by third parties 
with whom the Firm does business.
Subcategories and examples of operational risks
Operational risk can manifest itself in various ways. 
Operational risk subcategories include Compliance risk, 
Conduct risk, Legal risk, and Estimations and Model risk. 
Refer to pages 151, 152, 153 and 154, respectively for 
more information on Compliance, Conduct, Legal, and 
Estimations and Model risk. Details on other select 
examples of operational risks such as business and 
technology resiliency, payment fraud and third-party 
outsourcing, as well as cybersecurity, are provided below. 
War in Ukraine and Sanctions
In response to the war in Ukraine, numerous financial and 
economic sanctions have been imposed on Russia and 
Russia-associated entities and individuals by various 
governments around the world, including the authorities in 
the U.S., U.K. and EU. These sanctions are complex and 
continue to evolve. The Firm continues to face increased 
operational and other risks associated with addressing 
these complex compliance-related matters. To manage this 
increased risk, the Firm has implemented controls 
reasonably designed to mitigate the risk of non-compliance 
and to prevent dealing with sanctioned persons or in 
property subject to sanctions, as well as to block or restrict 
payments as required by the applicable regulations.
Business and technology resiliency risk 
Disruptions can occur due to forces beyond the Firm’s 
control such as the spread of infectious diseases or 
pandemics, severe weather, natural disasters, the effects of 
climate change, power or telecommunications loss, failure 
of a third party to provide expected services, cyberattacks, 
civil or political unrest or terrorism. The Firmwide Business 
Resiliency Program is designed to enable the Firm to 
prepare for, adapt to, withstand and recover from business 
disruptions including occurrence of extraordinary events 
beyond its control that may impact critical business 
functions and supporting assets including staff, technology, 
facilities and third parties. The program includes 
governance, awareness training, planning and testing of 
recovery strategies, as well as strategic and tactical 
initiatives to identify, assess, and manage business 
resiliency risks. The program is required to be managed in 
accordance with the Firm’s overall approach to Operational 
Risk Management, including alignment with technology, 
cybersecurity, data, physical security, crisis management, 
real estate and outsourcing programs.
Payment fraud risk
Payment fraud risk is the risk of external and internal 
parties unlawfully obtaining personal monetary benefit 
through misdirected or otherwise improper payment. The 
Firm employs various controls for managing payment fraud 
risk as well as providing employee and client education and 
awareness trainings.
Third-party outsourcing risk
The Firm‘s Third-Party Oversight (“TPO”) and Inter-affiliates 
Oversight (“IAO”) frameworks assist the LOBs and 
Corporate in selecting, documenting, onboarding, 
monitoring and managing their supplier relationships 
including services provided by affiliates. The objectives of 
the TPO framework are to hold suppliers and other third 
parties to an appropriate standard of operational 
performance and to mitigate key risks, including data loss 
and business disruptions. The Corporate Third-Party 
Oversight group is responsible for Firmwide training, 
monitoring, reporting and standards with respect to thirdparty outsourcing risks.

Cybersecurity risk
Cybersecurity risk is the risk of harm or loss resulting from 
misuse or abuse of technology or the unauthorized 
disclosure of data. 
Overview
Cybersecurity risk is an important and continuously evolving 
focus for the Firm. Significant resources are devoted to 
protecting and enhancing the security of computer systems, 
software, networks, storage devices, and other technology. 
The Firm’s security efforts are designed to protect against, 
among other things, cybersecurity attacks that can result in 
unauthorized access to confidential information, the 
destruction of data, disruptions to or degradations of 
service, the sabotaging of systems or other damage. 
The Firm has experienced, and expects that it will continue 
to experience, a higher volume and complexity of cyber 
attacks against the backdrop of heightened geopolitical 
tensions. The Firm has implemented measures and controls 
reasonably designed to address this evolving environment, 
including enhanced threat monitoring. In addition, the Firm 
continues to review and enhance its capabilities to address 
associated risks, such as those relating to the management 
of administrative access to systems.
Third parties with which the Firm does business, that 
facilitate the Firm’s business activities (e.g., vendors, supply 
chain, exchanges, clearing houses, central depositories, and 
financial intermediaries) or that the Firm has acquired are 
also sources of cybersecurity risk to the Firm. Third party 
incidents such as system breakdowns or failures, 
misconduct by the employees of such parties, or cyber 
attacks, including ransomware and supply-chain 
compromises, could have a material adverse effect on the 
Firm, including in circumstances in which an affected third 
party is unable to deliver a product or service to the Firm or 
where the incident delivers compromised software to the 
Firm or results in lost or compromised information of the 
Firm or its clients or customers.
Clients and customers are also sources of cybersecurity risk 
to the Firm and its information assets, particularly when 
their activities and systems are beyond the Firm’s own 
security and control systems. The Firm engages in periodic 
discussions with its clients, customers and other external 
parties concerning cybersecurity risks including 
opportunities to improve cybersecurity.
Risks from cybersecurity threats, including any previous 
cybersecurity events, have not materially affected the Firm 
or its business strategy, results of operations or financial 
condition. Notwithstanding the comprehensive approach 
that the Firm takes to address cybersecurity risk, the Firm 
may not be successful in preventing or mitigating a future 
cybersecurity incident that could have a material adverse 
effect on the Firm or its business strategy, results of 
operations or financial condition.
Organization and management 
The Global Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) 
reports to the Global Chief Information Officer, and is a 
member of key cybersecurity governance forums. The CISO 
leads the Global Cybersecurity and Technology Controls 
organization, which is responsible for identifying technology 
and cybersecurity risks and for implementing and 
maintaining controls to manage cybersecurity threats. The 
CISO is responsible for the Firm’s Information Security 
Program, which is designed to prevent, detect and respond 
to cyber attacks in order to help safeguard the 
confidentiality, integrity and availability of the Firm's 
infrastructure, resources and information. The program 
includes managing the Firm’s global cybersecurity 
operations centers, providing training, conducting 
cybersecurity event simulation exercises, implementing the 
Firm’s policies and standards relating to technology risk 
and cybersecurity management, and enhancing, as needed, 
the Firm’s cybersecurity capabilities. 
The Firm’s Information Security Program includes the 
following functions:
Cyber Operations, which is responsible for implementing 
and maintaining controls designed to detect and defend the 
Firm against cyber attacks, and includes a dedicated 
function for incident response and ongoing monitoring for 
cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities, including those 
among the Firm’s third-party suppliers.
Technology Governance, Risk & Controls, which is 
responsible for operationalizing technology risk and control 
frameworks, analyzing regulatory developments that may 
impact the Firm, and developing control catalogs and 
assessments of controls, as well as overseeing governance 
and reporting of technology and cybersecurity risk.
Security Awareness, which provides awareness and training 
that reinforces information risk and security management 
practices and compliance with the Firm's policies, standards 
and practices. The training is mandatory for all employees 
globally on a periodic basis, and it is supplemented by 
Firmwide testing initiatives, including periodic phishing 
tests. The Firm also provides specialized security training to 
employees in specific roles, such as application developers. 
The Firm’s Global Privacy Program requires all employees 
to take periodic training on data privacy that focuses on 
confidentiality and security, as well as responding to 
unauthorized access to or use of information.
Technology Resiliency, which establishes control 
requirements for planning and testing the prioritized 
recovery of technology services in the event of degradation 
or outage, including incident response planning, data 
backup and retention, and recovery readiness in support of 
the Firmwide Business Resiliency Program and operational 
risk management practices.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

The Firm has a cybersecurity incident response plan 
designed to enable the Firm to respond to attempted 
cybersecurity incidents, coordinate as appropriate with law 
enforcement and other government agencies, notify clients 
and customers, as applicable, and recover from such 
incidents. In addition, the Firm actively partners with 
appropriate government and law enforcement agencies and 
peer industry forums, participating in discussions and 
simulations to assist in understanding the full spectrum of 
cybersecurity risks and in enhancing defenses and 
improving resiliency in the Firm’s operating environment.
Governance and oversight
The governance structure for the Global Cybersecurity and 
Technology Controls organization is designed to 
appropriately identify, escalate and mitigate cybersecurity 
risks. Cybersecurity risk management and its governance 
and oversight are integrated into the Firm’s operational risk 
management framework, including through the escalation 
of key risk and control issues to management and the 
development of risk mitigation plans for heightened risk 
and control issues. IRM independently assesses and 
challenges the activities and risk management practices of 
the Global Cybersecurity and Technology Controls 
organization related to the identification, assessment, 
measurement and mitigation of cybersecurity risk. As 
needed, the Firm engages third-party assessors or auditing 
firms with industry-recognized expertise on cybersecurity 
matters to review specific aspects of the Firm’s 
cybersecurity risk management framework, processes and 
controls.
The governance and oversight for cybersecurity risk 
management includes governance forums that inform 
management of key areas of concern regarding the 
prevention, detection, mitigation and remediation of 
cybersecurity risks. 
The Cybersecurity and Technology Controls Operating 
Committee (“CTOC”) is the principal management 
committee that oversees the Firm’s assessment and 
management of cybersecurity risk, including oversight of 
the implementation and maintenance of appropriate 
controls in support of the Firm’s Information Security 
Program. The membership of the CTOC includes senior 
representatives from the Global Cybersecurity and 
Technology Controls organization and relevant corporate 
functions, including IRM and Internal Audit. CTOC members 
have extensive experience and qualifications in various 
technology and information security disciplines, including 
relevant experience at the Firm, at other financial services 
companies or in other highly-regulated industries. 
The CTOC escalates key operational risk and control issues, 
as appropriate, to the Global Technology Operating 
Committee (“GTOC”) or its business control committee or to 
the appropriate LOB and Corporate Control Committees. 
The GTOC is responsible for the governance of the Firmwide 
Global Technology organization, including oversight of 
Firmwide technology strategies, the delivery of technology 
and technology operations, the effective use of information 
technology resources, and monitoring and resolving key 
operational risk and control matters arising in the Global 
Technology organization.
As part of its oversight of management’s implementation 
and maintenance of the Firm’s risk management 
framework, the Firm’s Board of Directors receives periodic 
updates from the CIO, the CISO and senior members of the 
CTOC concerning cybersecurity matters. These updates 
generally include information regarding cybersecurity and 
technology developments, the Firm’s Information Security 
Program and recommended changes to that program, 
cybersecurity policies and practices, and ongoing initiatives 
to improve information security, as well as any significant 
cybersecurity incidents and the Firm's efforts to address 
those incidents. The Audit Committee and the Risk 
Committee assist the Board in this oversight.

COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT
Compliance risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the 
risk of failing to comply with laws, rules, regulations or 
codes of conduct and standards of self-regulatory 
organizations. 
Overview
Each of the LOBs and Corporate hold primary ownership of 
and accountability for managing their compliance risk. The 
Firm’s Operational Risk and Compliance Organization 
(“Operational Risk and Compliance”), which is independent 
of the LOBs and Corporate, provides independent review, 
monitoring and oversight of business operations with a 
focus on compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations 
applicable to the delivery of the Firm’s products and 
services to clients and customers.
These compliance risks relate to a wide variety of laws, 
rules and regulations across the LOBs and Corporate, and 
jurisdictions, and include risks related to financial products 
and services, relationships and interactions with clients and 
customers, and employee activities. For example, 
compliance risks include those associated with anti-money 
laundering compliance, trading activities, market conduct, 
and complying with the laws, rules, and regulations related 
to the offering of products and services across jurisdictional 
borders. Compliance risk is also inherent in the Firm’s 
fiduciary activities, including the failure to exercise the 
applicable standard of care to act in the best interest of 
fiduciary clients and customers or to treat fiduciary clients 
and customers fairly.
Other functions provide oversight of significant regulatory 
obligations that are specific to their respective areas of 
responsibility.
Operational Risk and Compliance implements policies and 
standards designed to govern, identify, measure, monitor 
and test, manage, and report on compliance risk.
Governance and oversight
Operational Risk and Compliance is led by the Firm’s Global 
CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk 
Appetite.
The Firm maintains oversight and coordination of its 
compliance risk through the CCOR Management Framework. 
The Firm’s Global CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and 
Qualitative Risk Appetite also provides regular updates to 
the Board Risk Committee and the Audit Committee on 
significant compliance risk issues, as appropriate. 
Code of Conduct
The Firm has a Code of Conduct (the “Code”) that sets forth 
the Firm’s expectation that employees will conduct 
themselves with integrity, at all times. The Code provides 
the principles that help govern employee conduct with 
clients, customers, suppliers, vendors, shareholders, 
regulators, other employees, as well as with the markets 
and communities in which the Firm operates. The Code 
requires employees to promptly report any potential or 
actual violation of the Code, any Firm policy, or any law or 
regulation applicable to the Firm’s business. It also requires 
employees to report any illegal or unethical conduct, or 
conduct that violates the underlying principles of the Code, 
by any of the Firm’s employees, consultants, clients, 
customers, suppliers, contract or temporary workers, or 
business partners or agents. Training is assigned to newly 
hired employees upon joining the Firm, and to current 
employees periodically thereafter. Employees are required 
to affirm their compliance with the Code annually. 
Employees can report any potential or actual violations of 
the Code through the Firm’s Conduct Hotline (the “Hotline”) 
by phone or the internet. The Hotline is anonymous, where 
permitted by law, and is available at all times globally, with 
translation services and is administered by an outside 
service provider. The Code prohibits retaliation against 
anyone who raises an issue or concern in good faith or 
assists with an inquiry or investigation. Periodically, the 
Audit Committee receives reports on the Code of Conduct 
program.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

CONDUCT RISK MANAGEMENT
Conduct risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk 
that any action or misconduct by an employee could lead to 
unfair client or customer outcomes, impact the integrity of 
the markets in which the Firm operates, harm employees or 
the Firm, or compromise the Firm’s reputation.
Overview
Each LOB and Corporate is accountable for identifying and 
managing its conduct risk to provide appropriate 
engagement, ownership and sustainability of a culture 
consistent with the Firm’s Business Principles. The Business 
Principles serve as a guide for how employees are expected 
to conduct themselves. With the Business Principles serving 
as a guide, the Firm’s Code sets out the Firm’s expectations 
for each employee and provides information and resources 
to help employees conduct business ethically and in 
compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations 
everywhere the Firm operates. Refer to Compliance Risk 
Management on page 151 for further discussion of the 
Code.
Governance and oversight
The Firm maintains oversight and coordination of its 
conduct risk through the CCOR Management Framework.
The Firm has a senior forum that provides oversight of the 
Firm’s conduct initiatives to develop a more holistic view of 
conduct risks and to connect key programs across the Firm 
in order to identify opportunities and emerging areas of 
focus. This forum is responsible for setting overall program 
direction for strategic enhancements to the Firm's 
employee conduct framework and reviewing the 
consolidated Firmwide Conduct Risk Appetite Assessment.
Conduct risk management encompasses various aspects of 
people management practices throughout the employee life 
cycle, including recruiting, onboarding, training and 
development, performance management, promotion and 
compensation processes. Each LOB, Treasury and CIO, and 
each designated corporate function completes an 
assessment of conduct risk periodically, reviews metrics 
and issues which may involve conduct risk, and provides 
conduct education as appropriate.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

LEGAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Legal risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk of 
loss primarily caused by the actual or alleged failure to 
meet legal obligations that arise from the rule of law in 
jurisdictions in which the Firm operates, agreements with 
clients and customers, and products and services offered by 
the Firm. 
Overview
The global Legal function (“Legal”) provides legal services 
and advice to the Firm. Legal is responsible for managing 
the Firm’s exposure to legal risk by:
managing actual and potential litigation and 
enforcement matters, including internal reviews and 
investigations related to such matters
advising on products and services, including contract 
negotiation and documentation
advising on offering and marketing documents and new 
business initiatives
managing dispute resolution
interpreting existing laws, rules and regulations, and 
advising on changes to them
advising on advocacy in connection with contemplated 
and proposed laws, rules and regulations, and 
providing legal advice to the LOBs, Corporate and the 
Board. 
Legal selects, engages and manages outside counsel for the 
Firm on all matters in which outside counsel is engaged. In 
addition, Legal advises the Firm’s Conflicts Office which 
reviews the Firm’s wholesale transactions that may have 
the potential to create conflicts of interest for the Firm. 
Governance and oversight
The Firm’s General Counsel reports to the CEO and is a 
member of the Operating Committee, the Firmwide Risk 
Committee and the Firmwide Control Committee. The Firm’s 
General Counsel and other members of Legal report on 
significant legal matters to the Firm’s Board of Directors 
and to the Audit Committee. 
Legal serves on and advises various committees and advises 
the Firm’s LOBs and Corporate on potential reputation risk 
issues.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

ESTIMATIONS AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT
Estimations and Model risk, a subcategory of operational 
risk, is the potential for adverse consequences from 
decisions based on incorrect or misused estimation outputs. 
The Firm uses models and other analytical and judgmentbased estimations across various businesses and functions. 
The estimation methods are of varying levels of 
sophistication and are used for many purposes, such as the 
valuation of positions and measurement of risk, assessing 
regulatory capital requirements, conducting stress testing, 
evaluating the allowance for credit losses and making 
business decisions. A dedicated independent function, 
Model Risk Governance and Review (“MRGR”), defines and 
governs the Firm’s policies relating to the management of 
model risk and risks associated with certain analytical and 
judgment-based estimations, such as those used in risk 
management, budget forecasting and capital planning and 
analysis. 
The governance of analytical and judgment-based 
estimations within MRGR’s scope follows a consistent 
approach which is used for models, as described in detail 
below. 
Model risks are owned by the users of the models within the 
LOBs and Corporate based on the specific purposes of such 
models. Users and developers of models are responsible for 
developing, implementing and testing their models, as well 
as referring models to MRGR for review and approval. Once 
models have been approved, model users and developers 
are responsible for maintaining a robust operating 
environment, and must monitor and evaluate the 
performance of the models on an ongoing basis. Model 
users and developers may seek to enhance models in 
response to changes in the relevant portfolios and in 
product and market developments, as well as to capture 
improvements in available modeling techniques and 
systems capabilities. 
Models are tiered based on an internal standard according 
to their complexity, the exposure associated with the model 
and the Firm’s reliance on the model. This tiering is subject 
to the approval of MRGR. In its review of a model, MRGR 
considers whether the model is suitable for the specific 
purposes for which it will be used. When reviewing a model, 
MRGR analyzes and challenges the model methodology and 
the reasonableness of model assumptions, and may 
perform or require additional testing, including back-testing 
of model outcomes. Model reviews are approved by the 
appropriate level of management within MRGR based on the 
relevant model tier.
Under the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk Management 
Policy, MRGR reviews and approves new models, as well as 
material changes to existing models, prior to their use. In 
certain circumstances, exceptions may be granted to the 
Firm’s policy to allow a model to be used prior to review or 
approval. MRGR may also require the user to take 
appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be 
used in the interim. These actions will depend on the model 
and may include, for example, limitation of trading activity.
While models are inherently imprecise, the degree of 
imprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the market 
or economic environment. This is particularly true when the 
current and forecasted environments are significantly 
different from the historical environments upon which the 
models were developed. This increased uncertainty may 
necessitate a greater degree of judgment and analytics to 
inform any adjustments that the Firm may make to model 
outputs than would otherwise be the case. In addition, the 
Firm may experience increased uncertainty in its estimates 
if assets acquired differ from those used to develop the 
models. 
Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on 
pages 155–158 and Note 2 for a summary of model-based 
valuations and other valuation techniques.
Management’s discussion and analysis

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM 
JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of estimates 
are integral to understanding its reported results. The 
Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require 
management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate 
carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has 
established policies and control procedures intended to 
ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments 
made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, 
independently reviewed and applied consistently from 
period to period. The methods used and judgments made 
reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or 
liabilities and the related business and risk management 
strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and 
portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are 
intended to ensure that the process for changing 
methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm 
believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of 
its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a 
brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates 
involving significant judgments.
Allowance for credit losses
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents 
management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the 
remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial assets 
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet 
lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit 
losses generally comprises:
• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s 
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),
• The allowance for lending-related commitments and
• The allowance for credit losses on investment securities.
The allowance for credit losses involves significant 
judgment on a number of matters including development 
and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of 
historical loss experience, assessment of risk 
characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of 
collateral, and the determination of remaining expected 
life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for further information 
on these judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and 
methodologies used to determine the Firm’s allowance for 
credit losses.
One of the most significant judgments involved in 
estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to 
the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses 
over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm’s 
methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates 
hundreds of macroeconomic variables (“MEVs”) that are 
relevant for exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit 
losses being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty 
variables. The specific variables that have the greatest 
effect on the modeled losses of each portfolio vary by 
portfolio and geography.
• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include regional U.S. 
unemployment rates and U.S. HPI.
• Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. 
unemployment, U.S. real GDP, U.S. equity prices, U.S. 
interest rates, U.S. corporate credit spreads, oil prices, 
U.S. commercial real estate prices and U.S. HPI.
Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of 
economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of 
expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet 
date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one 
reporting period to the next.
As a result of the First Republic acquisition, the Firm 
recorded an allowance for credit losses for the loans 
acquired and lending-related commitments assumed as of 
May 1, 2023. Given the differences in risk rating 
methodologies for the First Republic portfolio, and the 
ongoing integration of products and systems, the allowance 
for credit losses for the acquired wholesale portfolio was 
measured based on other facilities underwritten by the Firm 
with similar risk characteristics and not based on modeled 
estimates. As such, the First Republic wholesale portfolio is 
excluded from the modeled estimates sensitivity analysis 
below. The allowance for credit losses for predominantly all 
of the consumer portfolio was measured using the Firm’s 
modeled approach, as the consumer portfolio is 
predominantly residential real estate that has more 
commonly defined risk characteristics including loan to 
value ratio and credit score, and therefore is reflected in 
the sensitivity analysis below. Refer to Note 34 for 
additional information on the First Republic acquisition. 
It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one 
factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit 
losses because management considers a wide variety of 
factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit 
losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may 
not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across 
all geographies or product types, and changes in factors 
and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that 
improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration 
in others.
To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate 
macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled 
credit losses determined using its central and relative 
adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five 
scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan 
losses and lending-related commitments. The central and 
relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of 
MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of 
those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period. 
For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario 
shown on page 131 and in Note 13, the Firm’s relative 
adverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. unemployment 
rate, averaging approximately 2.1% higher over the eightquarter forecast, with a peak difference of approximately 
2.7% in the fourth quarter of 2024; lower U.S. real GDP 
with a slower recovery, remaining nearly 3.3% lower at the 
end of the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

approximately 3.9% in the fourth quarter of 2024; and 
lower HPI with a peak difference of approximately 17.9% in 
the third quarter of 2025.
This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future 
changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of 
reasons, including:
• The allowance as of December 31, 2023, reflects credit 
losses beyond those estimated under the central scenario 
due to the weight placed on the adverse scenarios.
• The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both 
interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this analysis 
cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes 
in macroeconomic variables. 
• Expectations of future changes in portfolio composition 
and borrower behavior can significantly affect the 
allowance for credit losses.
To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to 
macroeconomic forecasts as of December 31, 2023, the 
Firm compared the modeled estimates under its relative 
adverse scenario to its central scenario. Without 
considering offsetting or correlated effects in other 
qualitative components of the Firm’s allowance for credit 
losses, the comparison between these two scenarios for the 
exposures below reflect the following differences:
• An increase of approximately $850 million for residential 
real estate loans and lending-related commitments
• An increase of approximately $3.1 billion for credit card 
loans
• An increase of approximately $3.9 billion for wholesale 
loans and lending-related commitments
This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss 
estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the 
overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any 
potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative 
calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment 
management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates 
to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled 
lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances 
and conditions.
Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are 
inherently uncertain, the Firm believes that its process to 
consider the available information and associated risks and 
uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its 
estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and 
appropriate for the period ended December 31, 2023.
Fair value
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities 
at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are 
measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including 
derivatives, structured note products and certain securities 
financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities are 
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including 
certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the 
carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying 
collateral.
Assets measured at fair value 
The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at

Management’s discussion and analysis

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

Valuation
Details of the Firm’s processes for determining fair value 
are set out in Note 2. Estimating fair value requires the 
application of judgment. The type and level of judgment 
required is largely dependent on the amount of observable 
market information available to the Firm. For instruments 
valued using internally developed valuation models and 
other valuation techniques that use significant 
unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within 
level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to 
estimate fair value are more significant than those required 
when estimating the fair value of instruments classified 
within levels 1 and 2.
In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument 
within level 3, management must first determine the 
appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to 
use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant 
inputs requires management to assess relevant empirical 
data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, 
transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment 
speeds, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such 
as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of 
comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit 
curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the 
valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable 
inputs used.
For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management 
judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of 
valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, 
the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity 
considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios 
that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk 
position. The judgments made are typically affected by the 
type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the 
level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a 
whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and 
uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider 
variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for 
positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further 
discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm.
Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or 
other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded 
for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm 
believes its valuation methods are appropriate and 
consistent with those of other market participants, the 
methods and assumptions used reflect management 
judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and 
portfolios.
The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in 
the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or 
assumptions different than those used by the Firm could 
result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting 
date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s 
valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of 
fair value for individual financial instruments.
Goodwill impairment 
Under U.S. GAAP, goodwill must be allocated to reporting 
units and tested for impairment at least annually. The 
Firm’s process and methodology used to conduct goodwill 
impairment testing is described in Note 15.
Management applies significant judgment when testing 
goodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with each 
business combination is allocated to the related reporting 
units for goodwill impairment testing.
For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Firm reviewed 
current economic conditions, estimated market cost of 
equity, as well as actual business results and projections of 
business performance. Based on such reviews, the Firm has 
concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of 
December 31, 2023. For each of the reporting units, fair 
value exceeded carrying value by at least 9% and there was 
no indication of a significant risk of goodwill impairment 
based on current projections and valuations. 
The projections for the Firm’s reporting units are consistent 
with management’s current business outlook assumptions 
in the short term, and the Firm’s best estimates of longterm growth and return on equity in the longer term. Where 
possible, the Firm uses third-party and peer data to 
benchmark its assumptions and estimates.
Refer to Note 15 for additional information on goodwill, 
including the goodwill impairment assessment as of 
December 31, 2023.
Credit card rewards liability
JPMorgan Chase offers credit cards with various rewards 
programs which allow cardholders to earn rewards points 
based on their account activity and the terms and 
conditions of the rewards program. Generally, there are no 
limits on the points that an eligible cardholder can earn, nor 
do the points expire, and the points can be redeemed for a 
variety of rewards, including cash (predominantly in the 
form of account credits), gift cards and travel. The Firm 
maintains a rewards liability which represents the 
estimated cost of rewards points earned and expected to be 
redeemed by cardholders. The liability is accrued as the 
cardholder earns the benefit and is reduced when the 
cardholder redeems points. This liability was $13.2 billion 
and $11.3 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, 
respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other 
liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. The increase 
in the liability was predominantly driven by continued 
growth in rewards points earned on higher spend and 
promotional offers outpacing redemptions throughout 
2023, and, to a lesser extent, adjustments to certain 
reward program terms in the second quarter of 2023.
The rewards liability is sensitive to redemption rate (“RR”) 
and cost per point (“CPP”) assumptions. The RR assumption 
is used to estimate the number of points earned by 
customers that will be redeemed over the life of the 
account. The CPP assumption is used to estimate the cost of 
future point redemptions. These assumptions are evaluated 
periodically considering historical actuals, cardholder 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

redemption behavior and management judgment. Updates 
to these assumptions will impact the rewards liability. As of 
December 31, 2023, a combined increase of 25 basis 
points in RR and 1 basis point in CPP would increase the 
rewards liability by approximately $376 million.
Income taxes 

various jurisdictions in which it operates, including U.S. 
federal, state and local, and non-U.S. jurisdictions. These 
laws are often complex and may be subject to different 
interpretations. To determine the financial statement 
impact of accounting for income taxes, including the 
provision for income tax expense and unrecognized tax 
benefits, JPMorgan Chase must make assumptions and 
judgments about how to interpret and apply these complex 
tax laws to numerous transactions and business events, as 
well as make judgments regarding the timing of when 
certain items may affect taxable income in the U.S. and 
non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.
JPMorgan Chase’s interpretations of tax laws around the 
world are subject to review and examination by the various 
taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where the Firm 
operates, and disputes may occur regarding its view on a 
tax position. These disputes over interpretations with the 
various taxing authorities may be settled by audit, 
administrative appeals or adjudication in the court systems 
of the tax jurisdictions in which the Firm operates. 
JPMorgan Chase regularly reviews whether it may be 
assessed additional income taxes as a result of the 
resolution of these matters, and the Firm records additional 
unrecognized tax benefits, as appropriate. In addition, the 
Firm may revise its estimate of income taxes due to changes 
in income tax laws, legal interpretations, and business 
strategies. It is possible that revisions in the Firm’s estimate 
of income taxes may materially affect the Firm’s results of 
operations in any reporting period.
Deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and 
liabilities measured for financial reporting versus income 
tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, 
in management’s judgment, their realizability is determined 
to be more likely than not. Deferred taxes are measured 
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income 
in the years in which those temporary differences are 
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred 
taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized within the 
provision for income taxes in the period enacted.
The Firm has also recognized deferred tax assets in 
connection with certain tax attributes, including net 
operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and foreign tax credit 
(“FTC”) carryforwards. The Firm performs regular reviews 
to ascertain whether its deferred tax assets are realizable. 
These reviews include management’s estimates and 
assumptions regarding future taxable income, including 
foreign source income, and may incorporate various tax 
planning strategies, including strategies that may be 
available to utilize NOLs and FTCs before they expire. In 
connection with these reviews, if it is determined that a 
deferred tax asset is not realizable, a valuation allowance is 
established. The valuation allowance may be reversed in a 
subsequent reporting period if the Firm determines that, 
based on revised estimates of future taxable income or 
changes in tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not 
that all or part of the deferred tax asset will become 
realizable. As of December 31, 2023, management has 
determined it is more likely than not that the Firm will 
realize its deferred tax assets, net of the existing valuation 
allowance.
The Firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as necessary 
when new information becomes available, including 
changes in tax law and regulations, and interactions with 
taxing authorities. Uncertain tax positions that meet the 
more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured to 
determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain 
tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit 
that management believes is more likely than not to be 
realized upon settlement. It is possible that the 
reassessment of JPMorgan Chase’s unrecognized tax 
benefits may have a material impact on its effective income 
tax rate in the period in which the reassessment occurs. 
Although the Firm believes that its estimates are 
reasonable, the final tax amount could be different from the 
amounts reflected in the Firm’s income tax provisions and 
accruals. To the extent that the final outcome of these 
amounts is different than the amounts recorded, such 
differences will generally impact the Firm’s provision for 
income taxes in the period in which such a determination is 
made.
The Firm’s provision for income taxes is composed of 
current and deferred taxes. The current and deferred tax 
provisions are calculated based on estimates and 
assumptions that could differ from the actual results 
reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent 
year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally 
recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and 
the global tax implications are known, which could impact 
the Firm’s effective tax rate.
Refer to Note 25 for additional information on income 
taxes.

estimates and judgments associated with establishing 
litigation reserves.

Management of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or 
the “Firm”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining 
adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal 
control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or 
under the supervision of, the Firm’s principal executive and 
principal financial officers, or persons performing similar 
functions, and effected by JPMorgan Chase’s Board of 
Directors, management and other personnel, to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for 
external purposes in accordance with accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. 
GAAP”).

includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records, that, in reasonable detail, accurately 
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the 
Firm’s assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and 
that receipts and expenditures of the Firm are being made 
only in accordance with authorizations of JPMorgan Chase’s 
management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable 
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of 
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Firm’s 
assets that could have a material effect on the financial 
statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over 
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. 
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future 
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the 
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may 
deteriorate. Management has completed an assessment of 
the effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over financial 
reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making the 
assessment, management used the “Internal Control — 
Integrated Framework” (“COSO 2013”) promulgated by the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission (“COSO”).
Based upon the assessment performed, management 
concluded that as of December 31, 2023, JPMorgan Chase’s 
internal control over financial reporting was effective based 
upon the COSO 2013 framework. Additionally, based upon 
management’s assessment, the Firm determined that there 
were no material weaknesses in its internal control over 
financial reporting as of December 31, 2023.
The effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over financial 
reporting as of December 31, 2023, has been audited by 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered 
public accounting firm, as stated in their report which 
appears herein.

Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of JPMorgan 
Chase & Co.:
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control 
over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance 
sheets of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries (the 
“Firm”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related 
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, 
changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of 
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, 
including the related notes (collectively referred to as the 
“consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited 
the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements 
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the 
financial position of the Firm as of December 31, 2023 and 
2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for 
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 
2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America. Also in our 
opinion, the Firm maintained, in all material respects, 
effective internal control over financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the 
COSO. 
Basis for Opinions
The Firm’s management is responsible for these 
consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective 
internal control over financial reporting, and for its 
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over 
financial reporting, included in the accompanying 
Management’s report on internal control over financial 
reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the 
Firm’s consolidated financial statements and on the Firm’s 
internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. 
We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) 
(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to 
the Firm in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws 
and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities 
and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of 
the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the consolidated financial statements are free of 
material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and 
whether effective internal control over financial reporting 
was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included 
performing procedures to assess the risks of material 
misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, 
whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures 
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included 
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts 
and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our 
audits also included evaluating the accounting principles 
used and significant estimates made by management, as 
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the 
consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal 
control over financial reporting included obtaining an 
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and 
testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. 
Our audits also included performing such other procedures 
as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe 
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial 
Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a 
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding 
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of 
financial statements for external purposes in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s 
internal control over financial reporting includes those 
policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance 
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the 
company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts 
and expenditures of the company are being made only in 
accordance with authorizations of management and 
directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable 
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of 
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the 
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the 
financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over 
financial reporting may not prevent or detect 
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of 
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that 
controls may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the 
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters 
arising from the current period audit of the consolidated 
financial statements that were communicated or required 
to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) 
relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the 
consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our 
especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. 
The communication of critical audit matters does not alter 
in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by 
communicating the critical audit matters below, providing 
separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the 
accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Allowance for Loan Losses – Portfolio-based component of 
Wholesale Loan and Credit Card Loan Portfolios 
As described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial 
statements, the allowance for loan losses for the portfoliobased component of the wholesale and credit card loan 
portfolios was $20.2 billion on total portfolio-based 
retained loans of $881.3 billion at December 31, 2023. The 
Firm’s allowance for loan losses represents management’s 
estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining 
expected life of the Firm's loan portfolios and considers 
expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. The 
portfolio-based component of the Firm’s allowance for loan 
losses for the wholesale and credit card retained loan 
portfolios begins with a quantitative calculation of expected 
credit losses over the expected life of the loan by applying 
credit loss factors to the estimated exposure at default. The 
credit loss factors applied are determined based on the 
weighted average of five internally developed 
macroeconomic scenarios that take into consideration the 
Firm's economic outlook as derived through forecast 
macroeconomic variables, the most significant of which are 
U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product. 
This quantitative calculation is further adjusted to take into 
consideration model imprecision, emerging risk 
assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are 
not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate.
The principal considerations for our determination that 
performing procedures relating to the allowance for loan 
losses for the portfolio-based component of the wholesale 
and credit card loan portfolios is a critical audit matter are 
(i) the significant judgment and estimation by management 
in the forecast of macroeconomic variables, specifically U.S. 
unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product, as the 
Firm’s forecasts of economic conditions significantly affect 
its estimate of expected credit losses at the balance sheet 
date, (ii) the significant judgment and estimation by 
management in determining the quantitative calculation 
utilized in their credit loss estimates and the adjustments to 
take into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk 
assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are 
not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate, 
which both in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, 
subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and in 
evaluating audit evidence obtained relating to the credit 
loss estimates and the appropriateness of the adjustments 
to the credit loss estimates, and (iii) the audit effort 
involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and 
knowledge.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and 
evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our 
overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. 
These procedures included testing the effectiveness of 
controls relating to the Firm’s allowance for loan losses, 
including controls over model validation and generation of 
macroeconomic scenarios. These procedures also included, 
among others, testing management’s process for estimating 
the allowance for loan losses, which involved (i) evaluating 
the appropriateness of the models and methodologies used 
in quantitative calculations; (ii) evaluating the 
reasonableness of forecasts of U.S. unemployment and U.S. 
real gross domestic product; (iii) testing the completeness 
and accuracy of data used in the estimate; and (iv) 
evaluating the reasonableness of management’s 
adjustments to the quantitative output for the impacts of 
model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and 
other subjective factors that are not yet otherwise reflected 
in the credit loss estimate. These procedures also included 
the use of professionals with specialized skill and 
knowledge to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of 
certain models, methodologies and macroeconomic 
variables.
Fair Value of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments
As described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial 
statements, the Firm carries $1.1 trillion of its assets and 
$541.4 billion of its liabilities at fair value on a recurring 
basis. Included in these balances are $11.3 billion of 
trading assets and $42.2 billion of liabilities measured at 
fair value on a recurring basis, collectively financial 
instruments, which are classified as level 3 as they contain 
one or more inputs to valuation which are unobservable 
and significant to their fair value measurement. The Firm 
utilized internally developed valuation models and 
unobservable inputs to estimate fair value of the level 3 
financial instruments. The unobservable inputs used by 
management to estimate the fair value of certain of these 
financial instruments include interest rate volatility, interest 
rate spread volatility, Bermudan switch value, and 
correlation relating to interest rates, interest rate-toforeign exchange, equity prices, equity-to-foreign exchange, 
equity-to-interest rate and credit.
The principal considerations for our determination that 
performing procedures relating to the fair value of certain 
level 3 financial instruments is a critical audit matter are (i) 
the significant judgment and estimation by management in 
determining the inputs to estimate fair value, which in turn 
led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and 
effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit 
evidence obtained related to the fair value of these financial 
instruments, and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of 
professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and 
evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our 
overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. 
These procedures included testing the effectiveness of 
controls relating to the Firm’s determination of the fair 
value, including controls over models, inputs, and data. 
These procedures also included, among others, the 
involvement of professionals with specialized skill and 
knowledge to assist in developing an independent estimate 
of fair value for a sample of these financial instruments and 
comparing management’s estimate to the independently 
developed estimate of fair value. Developing the 
independent estimate involved testing the completeness 
and accuracy of data provided by management, developing 
independent inputs and, as appropriate, evaluating and 
utilizing management’s aforementioned unobservable 
inputs.

Consolidated statements of cash flows

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

Note 1 – Basis of presentation
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a 
financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law 
in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the 
U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in 
investment banking, financial services for consumers and 
small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction 
processing and asset management. On May 1, 2023, 
JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets and assumed 
certain liabilities of First Republic Bank (the “First Republic 
acquisition”) from the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation (“FDIC”). The Firm continues to convert certain 
operations, and to integrate clients, products and services 
associated with the First Republic acquisition, to align with 
the Firm’s businesses and operations. Accordingly, 
reporting classification and internal risk rating profiles in 
the wholesale portfolio may change in future periods. Refer 
to Note 34 for additional information on the First Republic 
acquisition.
The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan 
Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. 
Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the 
accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by 
regulatory authorities.
Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts 
of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has 
a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany 
balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by 
the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not 
included on the Consolidated balance sheets.
The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial 
interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is 
a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity. 
Voting interest entities
Voting interest entities are entities that have sufficient 
equity and provide the equity investors voting rights that 
enable them to make significant decisions relating to the 
entity’s operations. For these types of entities, the Firm’s 
determination of whether it has a controlling interest is 
primarily based on the amount of voting equity interests 
held. Entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial 
interest, through ownership of the majority of the entities’ 
voting equity interests, or through other contractual rights 
that give the Firm control, are consolidated by the Firm.
Investments in companies in which the Firm has significant 
influence over operating and financing decisions (but does 
not own a majority of the voting equity interests) are 
accounted for (i) in accordance with the equity method of 
accounting, or (ii) at fair value if the fair value option was 
elected. These investments are generally included in other 
assets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue.
Certain Firm-sponsored asset management funds are 
structured as limited partnerships or limited liability 
companies. For many of these entities, the Firm is the 
general partner or managing member, but the nonaffiliated partners or members have the ability to remove 
the Firm as the general partner or managing member 
without cause (i.e., kick-out rights), based on a simple 
majority vote, or the non-affiliated partners or members 
have rights to participate in important decisions. 
Accordingly, the Firm does not consolidate these voting 
interest entities. However, in the limited cases where the 
non-managing partners or members do not have 
substantive kick-out or participating rights, the Firm 
evaluates the funds as VIEs and consolidates the funds if 
the Firm is the general partner or managing member and 
has both power and a potentially significant interest. 
The Firm’s investment companies and asset management 
funds have investments in both publicly-held and privatelyheld entities, including investments in buyouts, growth 
equity and venture opportunities. These investments are 
accounted for under investment company guidelines and, 
accordingly, irrespective of the percentage of equity 
ownership interests held, are carried on the Consolidated 
balance sheets at fair value, and are recorded in other 
assets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue. 
If consolidated, the Firm retains the accounting under such 
specialized investment company guidelines.
Variable interest entities 
VIEs are entities that, by design, either (1) lack sufficient 
equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without 
additional subordinated financial support from other 
parties, or (2) have equity investors that do not have the 
ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s 
operations through voting rights, or do not have the 
obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have the 
right to receive the residual returns of the entity.
The most common type of VIE is an SPE. SPEs are commonly 
used in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain 
assets and distribute the cash flows from those assets to 
investors. The basic SPE structure involves a company 
selling assets to the SPE; the SPE funds the purchase of 
those assets by issuing securities to investors. The legal 
documents that govern the transaction specify how the cash 
earned on the assets must be allocated to the SPE’s 
investors and other parties that have rights to those cash 
flows. SPEs are generally structured to insulate investors 
from claims on the SPE’s assets by creditors of other 
entities, including the creditors of the seller of the assets. 
The primary beneficiary of a VIE (i.e., the party that has a 
controlling financial interest) is required to consolidate the 
assets and liabilities of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is 
the party that has both (1) the power to direct the activities 
of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic 
performance; and (2) through its interests in the VIE, the 
Notes to consolidated financial statements
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits 
from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
To assess whether the Firm has the power to direct the 
activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s 
economic performance, the Firm considers all the facts and 
circumstances, including its role in establishing the VIE and 
its ongoing rights and responsibilities. This assessment 
includes, first, identifying the activities that most 
significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and 
second, identifying which party, if any, has power over 
those activities. In general, the parties that make the most 
significant decisions affecting the VIE (such as asset 
managers, collateral managers, servicers, or owners of call 
options or liquidation rights over the VIE’s assets) or have 
the right to unilaterally remove those decision-makers are 
deemed to have the power to direct the activities of a VIE.
To assess whether the Firm has the obligation to absorb 
losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the 
VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, the Firm 
considers all of its economic interests, including debt and 
equity investments, servicing fees, and derivatives or other 
arrangements deemed to be variable interests in the VIE. 
This assessment requires that the Firm apply judgment in 
determining whether these interests, in the aggregate, are 
considered potentially significant to the VIE. Factors 
considered in assessing significance include: the design of 
the VIE, including its capitalization structure; subordination 
of interests; payment priority; relative share of interests 
held across various classes within the VIE’s capital 
structure; and the reasons why the interests are held by the 
Firm.
The Firm performs on-going reassessments of: (1) whether 
entities previously evaluated under the majority votinginterest framework have become VIEs, based on certain 
events, and are therefore subject to the VIE consolidation 
framework; and (2) whether changes in the facts and 
circumstances regarding the Firm’s involvement with a VIE 
cause the Firm’s consolidation conclusion to change.
Refer to Note 14 for further discussion of Firm-sponsored 
VIEs.
Revenue recognition 
Interest income 
The Firm recognizes interest income on loans, debt 
securities, and other debt instruments, generally on a levelyield basis, based on the underlying contractual rate. Refer 
to Note 7 for further information.
Revenue from contracts with customers 
JPMorgan Chase recognizes noninterest revenue from 
certain contracts with customers, in investment banking 
fees, deposit-related fees, asset management fees, 
commissions and other fees, and components of card 
income, when the Firm’s related performance obligations 
are satisfied. Refer to Note 6 for further discussion of the 
Firm’s revenue from contracts with customers. 
Principal transactions revenue 
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities 
at fair value. Changes in fair value are reported primarily in 
principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for 
further discussion of fair value measurement. Refer to Note 
6 for further discussion of principal transactions revenue. 
Use of estimates in the preparation of consolidated 
financial statements
The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
revenue and expense, and disclosures of contingent assets 
and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these 
estimates.
Foreign currency translation
JPMorgan Chase revalues assets, liabilities, revenue and 
expense denominated in non-U.S. currencies into U.S. 
dollars using applicable exchange rates.
Gains and losses relating to translating functional currency 
financial statements for U.S. reporting are included in the 
Consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Gains 
and losses relating to nonfunctional currency transactions, 
including non-U.S. operations where the functional currency 
is the U.S. dollar, are reported in the Consolidated 
statements of income.
Offsetting assets and liabilities
U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables 
and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the 
related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net 
basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally 
enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP 
also permits securities sold and purchased under 
repurchase agreements and securities borrowed or loaned 
under securities loan agreements to be presented net when 
specified conditions are met, including the existence of a 
legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has 
elected to net such balances where it has determined that 
the specified conditions are met.
The Firm uses master netting agreements to mitigate 
counterparty credit risk in certain transactions, including 
derivative contracts, resale, repurchase, securities 
borrowed and securities loaned agreements. A master 
netting agreement is a single agreement with a 
counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed 
by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and 
settled through a single payment in a single currency in the 
event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a 
required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral 
or margin when due). Upon the exercise of derivatives 
termination rights by the non-defaulting party (i) all 
transactions are terminated, (ii) all transactions are valued 
and the positive values of “in the money” transactions are 
netted against the negative values of “out of the money” 
transactions and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation 
is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination 
amount. Upon exercise of default rights under repurchase 
Notes to consolidated financial statements

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

agreements and securities loan agreements in general (i) 
all transactions are terminated and accelerated, (ii) all 
values of securities or cash held or to be delivered are 
calculated, and all such sums are netted against each other 
and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of 
the parties to pay the netted termination amount.
Typical master netting agreements for these types of 
transactions also often contain a collateral/margin 
agreement that provides for a security interest in, or title 
transfer of, securities or cash collateral/margin to the party 
that has the right to demand margin (the “demanding 
party”). The collateral/margin agreement typically requires 
a party to transfer collateral/margin to the demanding 
party with a value equal to the amount of the margin deficit 
on a net basis across all transactions governed by the 
master netting agreement, less any threshold. The 
collateral/margin agreement grants to the demanding 
party, upon default by the counterparty, the right to set-off 
any amounts payable by the counterparty against any 
posted collateral or the cash equivalent of any posted 
collateral/margin. It also grants to the demanding party the 
right to liquidate collateral/margin and to apply the 
proceeds to an amount payable by the counterparty.
Refer to Note 5 for further discussion of the Firm’s 
derivative instruments. Refer to Note 11 for further 
discussion of the Firm’s securities financing agreements. 
Statements of cash flows
For JPMorgan Chase’s Consolidated statements of cash 
flows, cash is defined as those amounts included in cash 
and due from banks and deposits with banks on the 
Consolidated balance sheets.
Accounting standards adopted January 1, 2023
Derivatives and Hedging: Fair Value Hedging – Portfolio 
Layer Method
The adoption of this guidance expanded the ability to hedge 
a portfolio of fixed-rate assets to allow more types of assets 
to be included in the portfolio, and to allow more of the 
portfolio to be hedged. This guidance also clarified the 
types of derivatives that could be used as hedges, and the 
balance sheet presentation and disclosure requirements for 
the hedge accounting adjustments. As permitted by the 
guidance, the Firm elected to transfer HTM securities to AFS 
and designated those securities in a portfolio layer method 
hedge upon adoption. The adoption impact of the transfer 
on retained earnings was not material.
Refer to Note 5 and Note 10 for additional information.
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses: Troubled Debt 
Restructurings (“TDRs”) 
The adoption of this guidance eliminated the accounting 
and disclosure requirements for TDRs, including the 
requirement to measure the allowance using a discounted 
cash flow (“DCF”) methodology, and allowed the option of a 
non-DCF portfolio-based approach for modified loans to 
troubled borrowers. If a DCF methodology is still applied for 
these modified loans, the discount rate must be the postmodification effective interest rate, instead of the premodification effective interest rate. 
The Firm elected to apply its non-DCF, portfolio-based 
allowance approach for modified loans to troubled 
borrowers for all portfolios except collateral-dependent 
loans and nonaccrual risk-rated loans which the Firm 
elected to continue applying a DCF methodology. Refer to 
Note 13 for a description of the portfolio-based allowance 
approach and the asset-specific allowance approach.
This guidance was adopted on January 1, 2023 under the 
modified retrospective method which resulted in a net 
decrease to the allowance for credit losses of $587 million 
and an increase to retained earnings of $446 million, aftertax, predominantly driven by residential real estate and 
credit card.
The adoption of this guidance eliminated the disclosure 
requirements for TDRs including the requirement to assess 
whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a 
concession. The new guidance requires disclosure for loan 
modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty 
consisting of principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, 
other-than-insignificant payment delay, term extension or a 
combination of these modifications. The Firm has defined 
these types of modifications as financial difficulty 
modifications ("FDMs"). As a result of the elimination of the 
requirement to assess whether a modification is reasonably 
expected or involves a concession, the population of loans 
considered FDMs differs from those previously considered 
TDRs. This guidance also requires disclosure of current 
period gross charge-offs by vintage origination year.

Note 2 – Fair value measurement
JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities 
at fair value. These assets and liabilities are predominantly 
carried at fair value on a recurring basis (i.e., assets and 
liabilities that are measured and reported at fair value on 
the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets). Certain assets, 
liabilities and unfunded lending-related commitments are 
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, they 
are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are 
subject to fair value adjustments only in certain 
circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of 
impairment).
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to 
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the 
measurement date. Fair value is based on quoted market 
prices or inputs, where available. If prices or quotes are not 
available, fair value is based on valuation models and other 
valuation techniques that consider relevant transaction 
characteristics (such as maturity) and use, as inputs, 
observable or unobservable market parameters, including 
yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, prices (such as 
commodity, equity or debt prices), correlations, foreign 
exchange rates and credit curves. Fair value may also 
incorporate valuation adjustments. 
The level of precision in estimating unobservable market 
inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss 
recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the 
Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and 
consistent with those of other market participants, the 
methods and assumptions used reflect management 
judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and 
portfolios. 
The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in 
the determination of fair value. The use of different 
methodologies or assumptions by other market participants 
compared with those used by the Firm could result in the 
Firm deriving a different estimate of fair value at the 
reporting date. 
Valuation process 
Risk-taking functions are responsible for providing fair 
value estimates for assets and liabilities carried on the 
Consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The Firm’s 
Valuation Control Group (“VCG”), which is part of the Firm’s 
Finance function and independent of the risk-taking 
functions, is responsible for verifying these estimates and 
determining any fair value adjustments that may be 
required to ensure that the Firm’s positions are recorded at 
fair value. In addition, the Firm’s Valuation Governance 
Forum (“VGF”), which is composed of senior finance and 
risk executives, is responsible for overseeing the 
management of risks arising from valuation activities 
conducted across the Firm. The Firmwide VGF is chaired by 
the Firmwide head of the VCG (under the direction of the 
Firm’s Controller), and includes sub-forums covering the 
CIB, CCB, CB, AWM and certain corporate functions including 
Treasury and CIO. 
Price verification process 
The VCG verifies fair value estimates provided by the risktaking functions by leveraging independently derived 
prices, valuation inputs and other market data, where 
available. Where independent prices or inputs are not 
available, the VCG performs additional review to ensure the 
reasonableness of the estimates. The additional review may 
include evaluating the limited market activity including 
client unwinds, benchmarking valuation inputs to those 
used for similar instruments, decomposing the valuation of 
structured instruments into individual components, 
comparing expected to actual cash flows, reviewing profit 
and loss trends, and reviewing trends in collateral 
valuation. There are also additional levels of management 
review for more significant or complex positions.
The VCG determines any valuation adjustments that may be 
required to the estimates provided by the risk-taking 
functions. No adjustments to quoted prices are applied for 
instruments classified within level 1 of the fair value 
hierarchy (refer to the discussion below for further 
information on the fair value hierarchy). For other 
positions, judgment is required to assess the need for 
valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect liquidity 
considerations, unobservable parameters, and, for certain 
portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net 
open risk position. The determination of such adjustments 
follows a consistent framework across the Firm:
Liquidity valuation adjustments are considered where an 
observable external price or valuation parameter exists 
but is of lower reliability, potentially due to lower 
market activity. Liquidity valuation adjustments are 
made based on current market conditions. Factors that 
may be considered in determining the liquidity 
adjustment include analysis of: (1) the estimated bidoffer spread for the instrument being traded; (2) 
alternative pricing points for similar instruments in 
active markets; and (3) the range of reasonable values 
that the price or parameter could take. 
The Firm manages certain portfolios of financial 
instruments on the basis of net open risk exposure and, 
as permitted by U.S. GAAP, has elected to estimate the 
fair value of such portfolios on the basis of a transfer of 
the entire net open risk position in an orderly 
transaction. Where this is the case, valuation 
adjustments may be necessary to reflect the cost of 
exiting a larger-than-normal market-size net open risk 
position. Where applied, such adjustments are based on 
factors that a relevant market participant would 
consider in the transfer of the net open risk position, 
including the size of the adverse market move that is 
likely to occur during the period required to sufficiently 
reduce the net open risk position. 
Uncertainty adjustments related to unobservable 
parameters may be made when positions are valued 
using prices or input parameters to valuation models 
that are unobservable due to a lack of market activity or 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

because they cannot be implied from observable market 
data. Such prices or parameters must be estimated and 
are, therefore, subject to management judgment. 
Adjustments are made to reflect the uncertainty 
inherent in the resulting valuation estimate. 
Where appropriate, the Firm also applies adjustments to 
its estimates of fair value in order to appropriately 
reflect counterparty credit quality (CVA), the Firm’s own 
creditworthiness (DVA) and the impact of funding (FVA), 
using a consistent framework across the Firm. Refer to 
Credit and funding adjustments on page 192 of this Note 
for more information on such adjustments.
Valuation model review and approval 
If prices or quotes are not available for an instrument or a 
similar instrument, fair value is generally determined using 
valuation models that consider relevant transaction terms 
such as maturity and use as inputs market-based or 
independently sourced parameters. Where this is the case 
the price verification process described above is applied to 
the inputs in those models. 
Under the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk Management 
Policy, MRGR reviews and approves new models, as well as 
material changes to existing models, prior to 
implementation in the operating environment. In certain 
circumstances exceptions may be granted to the Firm’s 
policy to allow a model to be used prior to review or 
approval. MRGR may also require the user to take 
appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be 
used in the interim. These actions will depend on the model 
and may include, for example, limitation of trading activity. 
Fair value hierarchy 
A three-level fair value hierarchy has been established 
under U.S. GAAP for disclosure of fair value measurements. 
The fair value hierarchy is based on the observability of 
inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the 
measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows. 
Level 1 – inputs to the valuation methodology are 
quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or 
liabilities in active markets. 
Level 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology include 
quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active 
markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or 
liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the 
full term of the financial instrument.
Level 3 – one or more inputs to the valuation 
methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair 
value measurement. 
A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value 
hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is 
significant to the fair value measurement.

(a) At December 31, 2023 and 2022, included total U.S. GSE obligations of $78.5 billion and $73.8 billion, respectively, which were mortgage-related.
(b) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net realizable value” is a term defined in U.S. 
GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not 
applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities 
inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities 
approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 5 for a further 
discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have 
been included in each period presented.
(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions).

(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be 
classified in the fair value hierarchy. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private 
equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $1.0 billion and $950 million, respectively. Included in these balances at December 31, 2023 and 2022, 
were trading assets of $42 million and $43 million, respectively, and other assets of $984 million and $907 million, respectively.
(e) At December 31, 2023 and 2022, included $10.2 billion and $9.7 billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $6.0 billion and $6.8 
billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell 
to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $2.9 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively.
(f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid 
when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit 
associated with cash collateral.

Level 3 valuations
The Firm has established well-structured processes for 
determining fair value, including for instruments where fair 
value is estimated using significant unobservable inputs 
(level 3). Refer to pages 175–179 of this Note for further 
information on the Firm’s valuation process and a detailed 
discussion of the determination of fair value for individual 
financial instruments. 
Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. 
The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent 
on the amount of observable market information available to 
the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed 
valuation models and other valuation techniques that use 
significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified 
within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to 
estimate fair value are more significant than those required 
when estimating the fair value of instruments classified 
within levels 1 and 2. 
In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument 
within level 3, management must first determine the 
appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to 
use. Second, due to the lack of observability of significant 
inputs, management must assess relevant empirical data in 
deriving valuation inputs including transaction details, yield 
curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates, 
volatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or 
debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments, foreign 
exchange rates and credit curves. 
The following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3 
financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to 
measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the 
significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those 
inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of such 
inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument 
within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable 
inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial 
instruments typically include observable components (that is, 
components that are actively quoted and can be validated to 
external sources) in addition to the unobservable 
components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not 
included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk 
of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments 
using securities and derivative positions that are classified 
within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
The range of values presented in the table is representative 
of the highest and lowest level input used to value the 
significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument 
classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the 
input values presented in the table are calculated based on 
the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used 
to value. 
In the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic 
average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty 
or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s 
estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the 
characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm 
and the relative distribution of instruments within the range 
of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may 
have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation 
uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied 
volatility levels because the option contracts have different 
underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and 
weighted and arithmetic average values will therefore vary 
from period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on 
the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at 
each balance sheet date.

(a) The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from their classification on the Consolidated 
balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued 
using the technique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ.
(b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $758 million, nonagency securities of $5 million and non-trading loans of $980 million.
(c) Comprises nonagency securities of $12 million, trading loans of $65 million and non-trading loans of $1.4 billion. 
(d) Comprises trading loans of $619 million and non-trading loans of $716 million.
(e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are financial instruments that typically contain 
embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant 
unobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.
(f) Includes equity securities of $671 million including $544 million in Other assets, for which quoted prices are not readily available and the fair value is 
generally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA multiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant 
both individually and in aggregate.
(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed on pricebased internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a par value of $100.
(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.
(i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are used.

Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs 
The following discussion provides a description of the impact 
on a fair value measurement of a change in each 
unobservable input in isolation, and the interrelationship 
between unobservable inputs, where relevant and significant. 
The impact of changes in inputs may not be independent, as a 
change in one unobservable input may give rise to a change 
in another unobservable input. Where relationships do exist 
between two unobservable inputs, those relationships are 
discussed below. Relationships may also exist between 
observable and unobservable inputs (for example, as 
observable interest rates rise, unobservable prepayment 
rates decline); such relationships have not been included in 
the discussion below. In addition, for each of the individual 
relationships described below, the inverse relationship would 
also generally apply. 
The following discussion also provides a description of 
attributes of the underlying instruments and external market 
factors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of 
the Firm’s positions. 
Yield – The yield of an asset is the interest rate used to 
discount future cash flows in a discounted cash flow 
calculation. An increase in the yield, in isolation, would result 
in a decrease in a fair value measurement. 
Credit spread – The credit spread is the amount of additional 
annualized return over the market interest rate that a market 
participant would demand for taking exposure to the credit 
risk of an instrument. The credit spread for an instrument 
forms part of the discount rate used in a discounted cash flow 
calculation. Generally, an increase in the credit spread would 
result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. 
The yield and the credit spread of a particular mortgagebacked security primarily reflect the risk inherent in the 
instrument. The yield is also impacted by the absolute level of 
the coupon paid by the instrument (which may not 
correspond directly to the level of inherent risk). Therefore, 
the range of yield and credit spreads reflects the range of risk 
inherent in various instruments owned by the Firm. The risk 
inherent in mortgage-backed securities is driven by the 
subordination of the security being valued and the 
characteristics of the underlying mortgages within the 
collateralized pool, including borrower FICO scores, LTV 
ratios for residential mortgages and the nature of the 
property and/or any tenants for commercial mortgages. For 
corporate debt securities, obligations of U.S. states and 
municipalities and other similar instruments, credit spreads 
reflect the credit quality of the obligor and the tenor of the 
obligation. 
Prepayment speed – The prepayment speed is a measure of 
the voluntary unscheduled principal repayments of a 
prepayable obligation in a collateralized pool. Prepayment 
speeds generally decline as borrower delinquencies rise. An 
increase in prepayment speeds, in isolation, would result in a 
decrease in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a 
premium to par and an increase in a fair value measurement 
of assets valued at a discount to par. 
Prepayment speeds may vary from collateral pool to 
collateral pool, and are driven by the type and location of the 
underlying borrower, and the remaining tenor of the 
obligation as well as the level and type (e.g., fixed or floating) 
of interest rate being paid by the borrower. Typically 
collateral pools with higher borrower credit quality have a 
higher prepayment rate than those with lower borrower 
credit quality, all other factors being equal. 
Conditional default rate – The conditional default rate is a 
measure of the reduction in the outstanding collateral 
balance underlying a collateralized obligation as a result of 
defaults. While there is typically no direct relationship 
between conditional default rates and prepayment speeds, 
collateralized obligations for which the underlying collateral 
has high prepayment speeds will tend to have lower 
conditional default rates. An increase in conditional default 
rates would generally be accompanied by an increase in loss 
severity and an increase in credit spreads. An increase in the 
conditional default rate, in isolation, would result in a 
decrease in a fair value measurement. Conditional default 
rates reflect the quality of the collateral underlying a 
securitization and the structure of the securitization itself. 
Based on the types of securities owned in the Firm’s marketmaking portfolios, conditional default rates are most typically 
at the lower end of the range presented. 
Loss severity – The loss severity (the inverse concept is the 
recovery rate) is the expected amount of future realized 
losses resulting from the ultimate liquidation of a particular 
loan, expressed as the net amount of loss relative to the 
outstanding loan balance. An increase in loss severity is 
generally accompanied by an increase in conditional default 
rates. An increase in the loss severity, in isolation, would 
result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. 
The loss severity applied in valuing a mortgage-backed 
security depends on factors relating to the underlying 
mortgages, including the LTV ratio, the nature of the lender’s 
lien on the property and other instrument-specific factors.

Correlation – Correlation is a measure of the relationship 
between the movements of two variables. Correlation is a 
pricing input for a derivative product where the payoff is 
driven by one or more underlying risks. Correlation inputs are 
related to the type of derivative (e.g., interest rate, credit, 
equity, foreign exchange and commodity) due to the nature 
of the underlying risks. When parameters are positively 
correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in an 
increase in the other parameter. When parameters are 
negatively correlated, an increase in one parameter will 
result in a decrease in the other parameter. An increase in 
correlation can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair 
value measurement. Given a short correlation position, an 
increase in correlation, in isolation, would generally result in 
a decrease in a fair value measurement.
The level of correlation used in the valuation of derivatives 
with multiple underlying risks depends on a number of 
factors including the nature of those risks. For example, the 
correlation between two credit risk exposures would be 
different than that between two interest rate risk exposures. 
Similarly, the tenor of the transaction may also impact the 
correlation input, as the relationship between the underlying 
risks may be different over different time periods. 
Furthermore, correlation levels are very much dependent on 
market conditions and could have a relatively wide range of 
levels within or across asset classes over time, particularly in 
volatile market conditions. 
Volatility – Volatility is a measure of the variability in possible 
returns for an instrument, parameter or market index given 
how much the particular instrument, parameter or index 
changes in value over time. Volatility is a pricing input for 
options, including equity options, commodity options, and 
interest rate options. Generally, the higher the volatility of 
the underlying, the riskier the instrument. Given a long 
position in an option, an increase in volatility, in isolation, 
would generally result in an increase in a fair value 
measurement. 
The level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular 
option-based derivative depends on a number of factors, 
including the nature of the risk underlying the option (e.g., 
the volatility of a particular equity security may be 
significantly different from that of a particular commodity 
index), the tenor of the derivative as well as the strike price 
of the option. 
Bermudan switch value – The switch value is the difference 
between the overall value of a Bermudan swaption, which can 
be exercised at multiple points in time, and its most 
expensive European swaption and reflects the additional 
value that the multiple exercise dates provide the holder. 
Switch values are dependent on market conditions and can 
vary greatly depending on a number of factors, such as the 
tenor of the underlying swap as well as the strike price of the 
option. An increase in switch value, in isolation, would 
generally result in an increase in a fair value measurement.
Interest rate curve – The interest rate curve represents the 
relationship of interest rates over differing tenors. The 
interest rate curve is used to set interest rate and foreign 
exchange derivative cash flows and is also a pricing input 
used in the discounting of any derivative cash flow. 
Forward price – The forward price is the price at which the 
buyer agrees to purchase the asset underlying a forward 
contract on the predetermined future delivery date, and is 
such that the value of the contract is zero at inception. 
The forward price is used as an input in the valuation of 
certain derivatives and depends on a number of factors 
including interest rates, the current price of the underlying 
asset, and the expected income to be received and costs to be 
incurred by the seller as a result of holding that asset until 
the delivery date. An increase in the forward can result in an 
increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement. 
Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements 
The following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated 
balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for 
financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of 
the fair value hierarchy for the years ended December 31, 
2023, 2022 and 2021. When a determination is made to 
classify a financial instrument within level 3, the 
determination is based on the significance of the 
unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. 
However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in 
addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, 
observable components (that is, components that are actively 
quoted and can be validated to external sources); 
accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include 
changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that 
are part of the valuation methodology. The Firm riskmanages the observable components of level 3 financial 
instruments using securities and derivative positions that are 
classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as 
these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are 
not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables 
do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management 
activities related to such level 3 instruments.

Level 3 analysis
Consolidated balance sheets changes 
The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets 
since December 31, 2022, for those items measured at fair 
value on a recurring basis. Refer to Assets and liabilities 
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on page 193 
for further information on changes impacting items measured 
at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. 
For the year ended December 31, 2023
Level 3 assets were $23.7 billion at December 31, 2023, 
reflecting an increase of $30 million from December 31,

The increase for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 
driven by:
$1.7 billion increase in non-trading loans largely due to 
$1.1 billion of loans in CIB associated with First Republic.
$549 million increase in MSRs,
predominantly offset by:
$1.8 billion decrease in gross derivative receivables due 
to settlements and net transfers largely offset by gains 
and purchases.
Refer to Note 15 for information on MSRs.
Refer to the sections below for additional information.

Credit and funding adjustments – derivatives
Derivatives are generally valued using models that use as 
their basis observable market parameters. These market 
parameters generally do not consider factors such as 
counterparty nonperformance risk, the Firm’s own credit 
quality, and funding costs. Therefore, it is generally 
necessary to make adjustments to the base estimate of fair 
value to reflect these factors.
CVA represents the adjustment, relative to the relevant 
benchmark interest rate, necessary to reflect counterparty 
nonperformance risk. The Firm estimates CVA using a 
scenario analysis to estimate the expected positive credit 
exposure across all of the Firm’s existing positions with 
each counterparty, and then estimates losses based on the 
probability of default and estimated recovery rate as a 
result of a counterparty credit event considering 
contractual factors designed to mitigate the Firm’s credit 
exposure, such as collateral and legal rights of offset. The 
key inputs to this methodology are (i) the probability of a 
default event occurring for each counterparty, as derived 
from observed or estimated CDS spreads; and (ii) estimated 
recovery rates implied by CDS spreads, adjusted to consider 
the differences in recovery rates as a derivative creditor 
relative to those reflected in CDS spreads, which generally 
reflect senior unsecured creditor risk.
FVA represents the adjustment to reflect the impact of 
funding and is recognized where there is evidence that a 
market participant in the principal market would 
incorporate it in a transfer of the instrument. The Firm’s 
FVA framework, applied to uncollateralized (including 
partially collateralized) over-the-counter (“OTC”) 
derivatives incorporates key inputs such as: (i) the expected 
funding requirements arising from the Firm’s positions with 
each counterparty and collateral arrangements; and (ii) the 
estimated market funding cost in the principal market 
which, for derivative liabilities, considers the Firm’s credit 
risk (DVA). For collateralized derivatives, the fair value is 
estimated by discounting expected future cash flows at the 
relevant overnight indexed swap rate given the underlying 
collateral agreement with the counterparty, and therefore a 
separate FVA is not necessary.
The following table provides the impact of credit and 
funding adjustments on principal transactions revenue in 
the respective periods, excluding the effect of any 
associated hedging activities. The FVA presented below 
includes the impact of the Firm’s own credit quality on the 
inception value of liabilities as well as the impact of changes 
in the Firm’s own credit quality over time.

Credit and funding adjustments:
Derivatives CVA



Derivatives FVA

Valuation adjustments on fair value option elected 
liabilities
The valuation of the Firm’s liabilities for which the fair value 
option has been elected requires consideration of the Firm’s 
own credit risk. DVA on fair value option elected liabilities 
reflects changes (subsequent to the issuance of the liability) 
in the Firm’s probability of default and LGD, which are 
estimated based on changes in the Firm’s credit spread 
observed in the bond market. Realized (gains)/losses due to 
DVA for fair value option elected liabilities are reported in 
principal transactions revenue. Unrealized (gains)/losses 
are reported in OCI. Refer to page 190 in this Note and Note 
24 for further information.

Equity securities without readily determinable fair values 
The Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or 
minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (i.e., measurement alternative), 
with such changes recognized in other income. 
In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if deemed 
necessary to arrive at the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect the different 
rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the Firm’s valuation techniques for 
private equity direct investments. 
The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held as of 
December 31, 2023 and 2022, that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments recorded 
during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are included in the 
nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.

Included in other assets above is the Firm’s interest in approximately 37 million Visa Class B common shares (“Visa B shares”). 
These shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and are convertible into Visa Class A common shares (“Visa A shares”) 
at a specified conversion rate upon final resolution of certain litigation matters involving Visa. The conversion rate of Visa B 
shares to Visa A shares was 1.5875 at December 31, 2023 and may be adjusted by Visa depending on developments related 
to the litigation matters. The outcome of those litigation matters, and the effect that the resolution of those matters may have 
on the conversion rate, is unknown. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2023, there is significant uncertainty regarding when the 
transfer restrictions on Visa B shares may be terminated and what the final conversion rate for the Visa B shares will be. As a 
result of these considerations, as well as differences in voting rights, Visa B shares are not considered to be similar to Visa A 
shares, and they continue to be held at their nominal carrying value.
In connection with prior sales of Visa B shares, the Firm has entered into derivative instruments with the purchasers of the 
shares under which the Firm retains the risk associated with changes in the conversion rate. Under the terms of the derivative 
instruments, the Firm will (a) make or receive payments based on subsequent changes in the conversion rate and (b) make 
periodic interest payments to the purchasers of the Visa B shares. The payments under the derivative instruments will continue 
as long as the Visa B shares remain subject to transfer restrictions. The derivative instruments are accounted for at fair value 
using a discounted cash flow methodology based upon the Firm’s estimate of the timing and magnitude of final resolution of 
the litigation matters. The derivative instruments are recorded in trading liabilities, and changes in fair value are recognized in 
other income. As of December 31, 2023, the Firm held derivative instruments associated with 23 million Visa B shares that 
the Firm had previously sold, which are all subject to similar terms and conditions.
On January 24, 2024, Visa filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC announcing that Visa’s stockholders approved 
amendments to its Certificate of Incorporation that redenominate the Visa B shares to Visa Class B-1 common shares (“Visa 
B-1 shares”) and authorize Visa to conduct one or more exchange offers ("the Program") which, if conducted, would have the 
effect of releasing transfer restrictions on a portion of Visa's B-1 shares through an exchange for Visa Class C common shares 
(“Visa C shares”). The Program would entitle the Firm to exchange its Visa B-1 shares, for Visa Class B-2 common shares (”Visa 
B-2 shares”) and Visa C shares, through an initial exchange offer if and when conducted by Visa. The Visa B-2 shares would 
continue to be subject to the transfer restrictions associated with the Visa B shares. The Firm is then entitled to sell the Visa C 
shares received after a brief lock-up period expires, and Visa is also authorized to extend offers for potential future exchanges, 
each enabling the release of additional Visa B shares if certain conditions are met. The timing and likelihood of any initial or 
future exchange offer is dependent upon actions taken by Visa and other factors that may be outside of the Firm’s control.

Additional disclosures about the fair value of financial 
instruments that are not carried on the Consolidated 
balance sheets at fair value 
U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of 
certain financial instruments, which are included in the 
following table. However, this table does not include other 
items, such as nonfinancial assets, intangible assets, certain 
financial instruments, and customer relationships. In the 
opinion of management, these items, in the aggregate, add 
significant value to JPMorgan Chase.
Financial instruments for which carrying value approximates 
fair value 
Certain financial instruments that are not carried at fair 
value on the Consolidated balance sheets are carried at 
amounts that approximate fair value, due to their shortterm nature and generally negligible credit risk. These 
instruments include cash and due from banks, deposits with 
banks, federal funds sold, securities purchased under resale 
agreements and securities borrowed, short-term 
receivables and accrued interest receivable, short-term 
borrowings, federal funds purchased, securities loaned and 
sold under repurchase agreements, accounts payable, and 
accrued liabilities. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires that the 
fair value of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., 
demand, savings and certain money market deposits) be 
equal to their carrying value; recognition of the inherent 
funding value of these instruments is not permitted. 
The following table presents, by fair value hierarchy classification, the carrying values and estimated fair values at

(a) Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of the underlying loans (including principal, 
contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and 
primary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. Carrying 
value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s expected credit losses over its remaining expected 
life. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including 
credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value. 
(b) Includes FHLB advances in level 2 of Long-term debt and Short-term borrowings and the Purchase Money Note in level 3 of Long-term debt associated 
with First Republic. Refer to Notes 20 and 34 for additional information.

Note 3 – Fair value option
The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value 
for selected financial assets, financial liabilities, 
unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan 
commitments.
The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair 
value for several reasons including to mitigate income 
statement volatility caused by the differences between the 
measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain 
instruments that otherwise would be accounted for on an 
accrual basis) and the associated risk management 
arrangements that are accounted for on a fair value basis, 
as well as to better reflect those instruments that are 
managed on a fair value basis. 
The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following 
instruments: 
Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization 
warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting, 
or managed on a fair value basis, including lendingrelated commitments
Certain securities financing agreements
Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would 
otherwise be required to be separately accounted for as 
a derivative instrument 
Structured notes and other hybrid instruments, which 
are predominantly financial instruments that contain 
embedded derivatives, that are issued or transacted as 
part of client-driven activities 
Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by CIB’s 
consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying 
assets are carried at fair value

Determination of instrument-specific credit risk for items 
for which the fair value option was elected 
The following describes how the gains and losses that are 
attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, 
were determined. 
Loans and lending-related commitments: For floatingrate instruments, all changes in value are attributed to 
instrument-specific credit risk. For fixed-rate 
instruments, an allocation of the changes in value for 
the period is made between those changes in value that 
are interest rate-related and changes in value that are 
credit-related. Allocations are generally based on an 
analysis of borrower-specific credit spread and recovery 
information, where available, or benchmarking to 
similar entities or industries. 
Long-term debt: Changes in value attributable to 
instrument-specific credit risk were derived principally 
from observable changes in the Firm’s credit spread as 
observed in the bond market. 
Securities financing agreements: Generally, for these 
types of agreements, there is a requirement that 
collateral be maintained with a market value equal to or 
in excess of the principal amount loaned; as a result, 
there would be no adjustment or an immaterial 
adjustment for instrument-specific credit risk related to 
these agreements.

(b) There were no performing loans that were ninety days or more past due as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.
(c) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected 
structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipalprotected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for 
structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors 
are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.
(d) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity or, if 
applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date.
At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair value option was 
elected was $9.7 billion and $7.6 billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $97 million and $24 million, 
respectively. Refer to Note 28 for further information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments.

Note 4 – Credit risk concentrations
Concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of clients, 
counterparties or customers are engaged in similar 
business activities or activities in the same geographic 
region, or when they have similar economic features that 
would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to 
be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions.
JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its 
credit portfolios to assess potential credit risk 
concentrations and to obtain additional collateral when 
deemed necessary and permitted under the Firm’s 
agreements. Senior management is significantly involved in 
the credit approval and review process, and risk levels are 
adjusted as needed to reflect the Firm’s risk appetite.
In the Firm’s consumer portfolio, concentrations are 
managed primarily by product and by U.S. geographic 
region, with a key focus on trends and concentrations at the 
portfolio level, where potential credit risk concentrations 
can be remedied through changes in underwriting policies 
and portfolio guidelines. Refer to Note 12 for additional 
information on the geographic composition of the Firm’s 
consumer loan portfolios. In the wholesale portfolio, credit 
risk concentrations are evaluated primarily by industry and 
monitored regularly on both an aggregate portfolio level 
and on an individual client or counterparty basis. 
The Firm’s wholesale exposure is managed through loan 
syndications and participations, loan sales, securitizations, 
credit derivatives, master netting agreements, collateral 
and other risk-reduction techniques. Refer to Note 12 for 
additional information on loans. 
The Firm does not believe that its exposure to any 
particular loan product or industry segment results in a 
significant concentration of credit risk. 
Terms of loan products and collateral coverage are included 
in the Firm’s assessment when extending credit and 
establishing its allowance for credit losses. Refer to Note 13 
for additional information on the allowance for credit 
losses.

Note 5 – Derivative instruments 
Derivative contracts derive their value from underlying 
asset prices, indices, reference rates, other inputs or a 
combination of these factors and may expose 
counterparties to risks and rewards of an underlying asset 
or liability without having to initially invest in, own or 
exchange the asset or liability. JPMorgan Chase makes 
markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives 
to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. Predominantly 
all of the Firm’s derivatives are entered into for marketmaking or risk management purposes. 
Market-making derivatives 
The majority of the Firm’s derivatives are entered into for 
market-making purposes. Clients use derivatives to mitigate 
or modify interest rate, credit, foreign exchange, equity and 
commodity risks. The Firm actively manages the risks from 
its exposure to these derivatives by entering into other 
derivative contracts or by purchasing or selling other 
financial instruments that partially or fully offset the 
exposure from client derivatives. 
Risk management derivatives 
The Firm manages certain market and credit risk exposures 
using derivative instruments, including derivatives in hedge 
accounting relationships and other derivatives that are used 
to manage risks associated with specified assets and 
liabilities. 
The Firm generally uses interest rate derivatives to manage 
the risk associated with changes in interest rates. Fixed-rate 
assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in market 
value as interest rates change. Similarly, interest income 
and expense increase or decrease as a result of variablerate assets and liabilities resetting to current market rates, 
and as a result of the repayment and subsequent 
origination or issuance of fixed-rate assets and liabilities at 
current market rates. Gains and losses on the derivative 
instruments related to these assets and liabilities are 
expected to substantially offset this variability. 
Foreign currency derivatives are used to manage the 
foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign 
currency–denominated (i.e., non-U.S. dollar) assets and 
liabilities and forecasted transactions, as well as the Firm’s 
net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches 
whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. As a 
result of fluctuations in foreign currencies, the U.S. dollar–
equivalent values of the foreign currency–denominated 
assets and liabilities or the forecasted revenues or expenses 
increase or decrease. Gains or losses on the derivative 
instruments related to these foreign currency–denominated 
assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions, are expected 
to substantially offset this variability. 
Commodities derivatives are used to manage the price risk 
of certain commodities inventories. Gains or losses on these 
derivative instruments are expected to substantially offset 
the depreciation or appreciation of the related inventory. 
Credit derivatives are used to manage the counterparty 
credit risk associated with loans and lending-related 
commitments. Credit derivatives compensate the purchaser 
when the entity referenced in the contract experiences a 
credit event, such as bankruptcy or a failure to pay an 
obligation when due. Credit derivatives primarily consist of 
CDS. Refer to the Credit derivatives section on pages 214–
216 of this Note for a further discussion of credit 
derivatives. 
Refer to the risk management derivatives gains and losses 
table on page 214 and the hedge accounting gains and 
losses tables on pages 211–213 of this Note for more 
information about risk management derivatives. 
Derivative counterparties and settlement types 
The Firm enters into OTC derivatives, which are negotiated 
and settled bilaterally with the derivative counterparty. The 
Firm also enters into, as principal, certain ETD such as 
futures and options, and OTC-cleared derivative contracts 
with CCPs. ETD contracts are generally standardized 
contracts traded on an exchange and cleared by the CCP, 
which is the Firm’s counterparty from the inception of the 
transactions. OTC-cleared derivatives are traded on a 
bilateral basis and then novated to the CCP for clearing. 
Derivative clearing services 
The Firm provides clearing services for clients in which the 
Firm acts as a clearing member at certain exchanges and 
clearing houses. The Firm does not reflect the clients’ 
derivative contracts in its Consolidated Financial 
Statements. Refer to Note 28 for further information on the 
Firm’s clearing services. 
Accounting for derivatives 
All free-standing derivatives that the Firm executes for its 
own account are required to be recorded on the 
Consolidated balance sheets at fair value. 
As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm nets derivative 
assets and liabilities, and the related cash collateral 
receivables and payables, when a legally enforceable 
master netting agreement exists between the Firm and the 
derivative counterparty. Refer to Note 1 for further 
discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities. The 
accounting for changes in value of a derivative depends on 
whether or not the transaction has been designated and 
qualifies for hedge accounting. Derivatives that are not 
designated as hedges are reported and measured at fair 
value through earnings. The tabular disclosures on pages 
207–214 of this Note provide additional information on the 
amount of, and reporting for, derivative assets, liabilities, 
gains and losses. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for a further 
discussion of derivatives embedded in structured notes. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

Derivatives designated as hedges 
The Firm applies hedge accounting to certain derivatives 
executed for risk management purposes – generally interest 
rate, foreign exchange and commodity derivatives. 
However, JPMorgan Chase does not seek to apply hedge 
accounting to all of the derivatives associated with the 
Firm’s risk management activities. For example, the Firm 
does not apply hedge accounting to purchased CDS used to 
manage the credit risk of loans and lending-related 
commitments, because of the difficulties in qualifying such 
contracts as hedges. For the same reason, the Firm does 
not apply hedge accounting to certain interest rate, foreign 
exchange, and commodity derivatives used for risk 
management purposes. 
To qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly 
effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure 
being hedged. In addition, for a derivative to be designated 
as a hedge, the risk management objective and strategy 
must be documented. Hedge documentation must identify 
the derivative hedging instrument, the asset or liability or 
forecasted transaction and type of risk to be hedged, and 
how the effectiveness of the derivative is assessed 
prospectively and retrospectively. To assess effectiveness, 
the Firm uses statistical methods such as regression 
analysis, nonstatistical methods such as dollar-value 
comparisons of the change in the fair value of the derivative 
to the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged 
item, and qualitative comparisons of critical terms and the 
evaluation of any changes in those terms. The extent to 
which a derivative has been, and is expected to continue to 
be, highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value or 
cash flows of the hedged item must be assessed and 
documented at least quarterly. If it is determined that a 
derivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated 
exposure, hedge accounting is discontinued. 
There are three types of hedge accounting designations: fair 
value hedges, cash flow hedges and net investment hedges. 
JPMorgan Chase uses fair value hedges primarily to hedge 
fixed-rate long-term debt, AFS securities and certain 
commodities inventories. For qualifying fair value hedges, 
the changes in the fair value of the derivative, and in the 
value of the hedged item for the risk being hedged, are 
recognized in earnings. Certain amounts excluded from the 
assessment of effectiveness are recorded in OCI and 
recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative. If the 
hedge relationship is terminated, then the adjustment to 
the hedged item continues to be reported as part of the 
basis of the hedged item and, for interest-bearing financial 
instruments, is amortized to earnings as a yield adjustment. 
Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized 
consistent with the classification of the hedged item – 
primarily net interest income and principal transactions 
revenue. 
Effective January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted the new 
portfolio layer method hedge accounting guidance which 
expanded the ability to hedge a portfolio of fixed-rate 
assets to allow more types of assets to be included in the 
portfolio, and to allow more of the portfolio to be hedged. 
The Firm employs the Portfolio Layer Method to manage 
the interest rate risk of portfolios of fixed-rate assets. 
Throughout the life of the open hedge, basis adjustments 
are maintained at the portfolio level and are only allocated 
to individual assets under certain circumstances. These 
include instances where the portfolio amount falls below 
the hedged layer amounts, or in cases of voluntary dedesignation.
JPMorgan Chase uses cash flow hedges primarily to hedge 
the exposure to variability in forecasted cash flows from 
floating-rate assets and liabilities and foreign currency–
denominated revenue and expense. For qualifying cash flow 
hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are 
recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings as the hedged 
item affects earnings. Derivative amounts affecting 
earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of 
the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue, net 
interest income and compensation expense. If the hedge 
relationship is terminated, then the change in value of the 
derivative recorded in AOCI is recognized in earnings when 
the cash flows that were hedged affect earnings. For hedge 
relationships that are discontinued because a forecasted 
transaction is expected to not occur according to the 
original hedge forecast, any related derivative values 
recorded in AOCI are immediately recognized in earnings. 
JPMorgan Chase uses net investment hedges to protect the 
value of the Firm’s net investments in certain non-U.S. 
subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are 
not the U.S. dollar. For qualifying net investment hedges, 
changes in the fair value of the derivatives due to changes 
in spot foreign exchange rates are recorded in OCI as 
translation adjustments. Amounts excluded from the 
assessment of effectiveness are recorded directly in 
earnings.

Derivatives netting
The following tables present, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, gross and net derivative receivables and payables by 
contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from the same 
counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion 
with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, amounts are 
not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are shown 
separately in the tables below. 
In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables and 
payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate 
counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation: 
• collateral that consists of liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are shown 
separately as "Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets" in the tables below, up to the fair value exposure 
amount. For the purpose of this disclosure, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality 
liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule; 
• the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty level, as of 
the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and 
• collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not 
been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from the tables below.

Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features
In addition to the specific market risks introduced by each derivative contract type, derivatives expose JPMorgan Chase to 
credit risk — the risk that derivative counterparties may fail to meet their payment obligations under the derivative contracts 
and the collateral, if any, held by the Firm proves to be of insufficient value to cover the payment obligation. It is the policy of 
JPMorgan Chase to actively pursue, where possible, the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral 
agreements to mitigate derivative counterparty credit risk inherent in derivative receivables.
While derivative receivables expose the Firm to credit risk, derivative payables expose the Firm to liquidity risk, as the 
derivative contracts typically require the Firm to post cash or securities collateral with counterparties as the fair value of the 
contracts moves in the counterparties’ favor or upon specified downgrades in the Firm’s and its subsidiaries’ respective credit 
ratings. Certain derivative contracts also provide for termination of the contract, generally upon a downgrade of either the 
Firm or the counterparty, at the fair value of the derivative contracts. The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net 
derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that 
may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of 
business, at December 31, 2023 and 2022.

The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of JPMorgan 
Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at December 31, 2023 and 2022, related to OTC 
and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings 
downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the 
predefined rating threshold is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a 
preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral 
(except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination 
payment requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating 
of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.

Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset
In certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the economic exposure 
to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer. The 
Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note 11, but in limited 
circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers 
accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative was outstanding was not material at both December 31, 2023 and 
2022.

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of the benchmark (e.g., Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”)) interest rate risk of fixed-rate long-term debt and AFS 
securities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income. 
(b) Includes the amortization of income/expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied to the hedged item. Excludes the accrual 
of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged items.
(c) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses 
related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were 
recorded primarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income.
(d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value (net 
realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.
(e) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward 
points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-currency basis spreads. Excluded components may impact earnings either through 
amortization of the initial amount over the life of the derivative or through fair value changes recognized in the current period. 
(f) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization approach, predominantly crosscurrency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative.

(a) Excludes physical commodities with a carrying value of $5.6 billion and $26.0 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, to which the Firm 
applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing 
unrealized gains and losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to net income in future 
periods.
(b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments related to foreign currency hedges will not 
reverse through the income statement in future periods. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the carrying amount excluded for AFS securities is 
$19.3 billion and $20.3 billion, respectively, and for long-term debt is zero and $221 million, respectively. 
(c) Carrying amount represents the amortized cost, net of allowance if applicable. Effective January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted the portfolio layer method 
hedge accounting guidance. At December 31, 2023, the amortized cost of the portfolio layer method closed portfolios was $83.9 billion, of which $68.0 
billion was designated as hedged. The amount designated as hedged is the sum of the notional amounts of all outstanding layers in each portfolio, which 
includes both spot starting and forward starting layers. The cumulative amount of basis adjustments was $(165) million, which is comprised of $73 million 
and $(238) million for active and discontinued hedging relationships, respectively. Refer to Note 1 and Note 10 for additional information.
(d) Positive (negative) amounts related to assets represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will reduce (increase) net interest income in 
future periods. Positive (negative) amounts related to liabilities represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will increase (reduce) net 
interest income in future periods.
(e) Represents basis adjustments existing on the balance sheet date associated with hedged items that have been de-designated from qualifying fair value 
hedging relationships.

The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the years ended 2023, 2022 and 2021.
Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $(1.6) billion (after-tax) of net losses recorded in AOCI at 
December 31, 2023, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have been 
terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized in earnings is 
approximately six years, corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash flows. For open cash flow 
hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately seven years. The Firm’s 
longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities.
Net investment hedge gains and losses

and related income.
(b) Relates to credit derivatives used to mitigate credit risk associated 
with lending exposures in the Firm’s wholesale businesses. These

counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables, which is 
included in gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making 
activities and other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in 
principal transactions revenue.
(c) Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate foreign exchange risk 
of specified foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Gains 
and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.
Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making 
activities and other derivatives 
The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the 
needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain 
risks associated with net open risk positions from its 
market-making activities, including the counterparty credit 
risk arising from derivative receivables. All derivatives not 
included in the hedge accounting or specified risk 
management categories above are included in this 
category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are 
primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer 
to Note 6 for information on principal transactions revenue. 
Credit derivatives 
Credit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is 
derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a 
third-party issuer (the reference entity) and which allow 
one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to 
another party (the protection seller). Credit derivatives 
expose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of 
the protection seller, as the protection seller is required to 
make payments under the contract when the reference 
entity experiences a credit event, such as a bankruptcy, a 
failure to pay its obligation or a restructuring. The seller of 
credit protection receives a premium for providing 
protection but has the risk that the underlying instrument 
referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event. 
The Firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the 
credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two 
primary purposes. First, in its capacity as a market-maker, 
the Firm actively manages a portfolio of credit derivatives 
by purchasing and selling credit protection, predominantly 
on corporate debt obligations, to meet the needs of 
customers. Second, as an end-user, the Firm uses credit 
derivatives to manage credit risk associated with lending 
exposures (loans and unfunded commitments) in its 
wholesale and consumer businesses and derivatives 
counterparty exposures in its wholesale businesses, and to 
manage the credit risk arising from certain financial 
instruments in the Firm’s market-making businesses. 
Following is a summary of various types of credit 
derivatives.

Credit default swaps 
Credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single 
reference entity (“single-name”), broad-based index or 
portfolio. The Firm purchases and sells protection on both 
single- name and index-reference obligations. Single-name 
CDS and index CDS contracts are either OTC or OTC-cleared 
derivative contracts. Single-name CDS are used to manage 
the default risk of a single reference entity, while index CDS 
contracts are used to manage the credit risk associated with 
the broader credit markets or credit market segments. Like 
the S&P 500 and other market indices, a CDS index consists 
of a portfolio of CDS across many reference entities. New 
series of CDS indices are periodically established with a new 
underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes 
in the credit markets. If one of the reference entities in the 
index experiences a credit event, then the reference entity 
that defaulted is removed from the index. CDS can also be 
referenced against specific portfolios of reference names or 
against customized exposure levels: for example, to provide 
protection against the first $1 million of realized credit 
losses in a $10 million portfolio of exposure. Such 
structures are commonly known as tranche CDS. 
For both single-name CDS contracts and index CDS 
contracts, upon the occurrence of a credit event, under the 
terms of a CDS contract neither party to the CDS contract 
has recourse to the reference entity. The protection 
purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the 
difference between the face value of the CDS contract and 
the fair value of the reference obligation at settlement of 
the credit derivative contract, also known as the recovery 
value. The protection purchaser does not need to hold the 
debt instrument of the underlying reference entity in order 
to receive amounts due under the CDS contract when a 
credit event occurs. 
Credit-related notes 
A credit-related note is a funded derivative with a credit risk 
component where the issuer of the credit-related note 
purchases from the note investor credit protection on a 
reference entity or an index. Under the contract, the 
investor pays the issuer the par value of the note at the 
inception of the transaction, and in return, the issuer makes 
periodic payments to the investor, based on the credit risk 
of the referenced entity. The issuer also repays the investor 
the par value of the note at maturity unless the reference 
entity (or one of the entities that makes up a reference 
index) experiences a specified credit event. If a credit event 
occurs, the issuer is not obligated to repay the par value of 
the note, but rather, the issuer pays the investor the 
difference between the par value of the note and the fair 
value of the defaulted reference obligation at the time of 
settlement. Neither party to the credit-related note has 
recourse to the defaulting reference entity.
The following tables present a summary of the notional 
amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the 
Firm sold and purchased as of December 31, 2023 and 
2022. Upon a credit event, the Firm as a seller of protection 
would typically pay out a percentage of the full notional 
amount of net protection sold, as the amount actually 
required to be paid on the contracts takes into account the 
recovery value of the reference obligation at the time of 
settlement. The Firm manages the credit risk on contracts 
to sell protection by purchasing protection with identical or 
similar underlying reference entities. Other purchased 
protection referenced in the following tables includes credit 
derivatives bought on related, but not identical, reference 
positions (including indices, portfolio coverage and other 
reference points) as well as protection purchased by CIB 
through credit-related notes. Other purchased protection 
also includes credit protection against certain loans in the 
retained lending portfolio through the issuance of credit 
derivatives and credit-related notes. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, 
because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value 
of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the 
risks associated with such derivatives.

Note 6 – Noninterest revenue and noninterest expense
Noninterest revenue
The Firm records noninterest revenue from certain 
contracts with customers in investment banking fees, 
deposit-related fees, asset management fees, commissions 
and other fees, and components of card income. The related 
contracts are often terminable on demand and the Firm has 
no remaining obligation to deliver future services. For 
arrangements with a fixed term, the Firm may commit to 
deliver services in the future. Revenue associated with 
these remaining performance obligations typically depends 
on the occurrence of future events or underlying asset 
values, and is not recognized until the outcome of those 
events or values are known.
Investment banking fees 
This revenue category includes debt and equity 
underwriting and advisory fees. As an underwriter, the Firm 
helps clients raise capital via public offering and private 
placement of various types of debt and equity instruments. 
Underwriting fees are primarily based on the issuance price 
and quantity of the underlying instruments, and are 
recognized as revenue typically upon execution of the 
client’s transaction. The Firm also manages and syndicates 
loan arrangements. Credit arrangement and syndication 
fees, included within debt underwriting fees, are recorded 
as revenue after satisfying certain retention, timing and 
yield criteria. 
The Firm also provides advisory services, by assisting its 
clients with mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, 
restructuring and other complex transactions. Advisory fees 
are recognized as revenue typically upon execution of the 
client’s transaction.

Principal transactions 
Principal transactions revenue is driven by many factors, 
including: 
• the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the 
price at which a market participant is willing and able to 
sell an instrument to the Firm and the price at which 
another market participant is willing and able to buy it 
from the Firm, and vice versa; and 
• realized and unrealized gains and losses on financial 
instruments and commodities transactions, including 
those accounted for under the fair value option, primarily 
used in client-driven market-making activities. 
– Realized gains and losses result from the sale of 
instruments, closing out or termination of transactions, 
or interim cash payments. 
– Unrealized gains and losses result from changes in 
valuation. 
In connection with its client-driven market-making 
activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity 
instruments, derivatives and commodities, including 
physical commodities inventories and financial instruments 
that reference commodities. 
Principal transactions revenue also includes realized and 
unrealized gains and losses related to: 
• derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting 
relationships, primarily fair value hedges of commodity 
and foreign exchange risk; 
• derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, 
primarily to mitigate credit, foreign exchange and 
interest rate risks.
Refer to Note 5 for further information on the income 
statement classification of gains and losses from derivatives 
activities. 
In the financial commodity markets, the Firm transacts in 
OTC derivatives (e.g., swaps, forwards, options) and ETD 
that reference a wide range of underlying commodities. In 
the physical commodity markets, the Firm primarily 
purchases and sells precious and base metals and may hold 
other commodities inventories under financing and other 
arrangements with clients. 
The following table presents all realized and unrealized 
gains and losses recorded in principal transactions revenue. 
This table excludes interest income and interest expense on 
trading assets and liabilities, which are an integral part of 
the overall performance of the Firm’s client-driven marketmaking activities in CIB and fund deployment activities in 
Treasury and CIO. Refer to Note 7 for further information 
on interest income and interest expense. 
Trading revenue is presented primarily by instrument type. 
The Firm’s client-driven market-making businesses 
generally utilize a variety of instrument types in connection 
with their market-making and related risk-management 
activities; accordingly, the trading revenue presented in the 
table below is not representative of the total revenue of any 
individual LOB.

commitments are generally short term. Refer to Note 34 for additional 
information.
Lending- and deposit-related fees are earned by CCB, CIB, 
CB, and AWM.
Asset management fees
Investment management fees include fees associated with 
assets the Firm manages on behalf of its clients, including 
investors in Firm-sponsored funds and owners of separately 
managed investment accounts. Management fees are 
typically based on the value of assets under management 
and are collected and recognized at the end of each period 
over which the management services are provided and the 
value of the managed assets is known. The Firm also 
receives performance-based management fees, which are 
earned based on exceeding certain benchmarks or other 
performance targets and are accrued and recognized when 
the probability of reversal is remote, typically at the end of 
the related billing period.
All other asset management fees include commissions 
earned on the sales or distribution of mutual funds to 
clients. These fees are recorded as revenue at the time the 
service is rendered or, in the case of certain distribution 
fees, based on the underlying fund’s asset value or investor 
redemption activity.

This revenue category includes commissions and fees from 
brokerage and custody services, and other products.
Brokerage commissions represents commissions earned 
when the Firm acts as a broker, by facilitating its clients’ 
purchases and sales of securities and other financial 
instruments. Brokerage commissions are collected and 
recognized as revenue upon occurrence of the client 
transaction. The Firm reports certain costs paid to thirdparty clearing houses and exchanges net against 
commission revenue.
Administration fees predominantly include fees for custody, 
funds services, securities lending and securities clearance. 
These fees are recorded as revenue over the period in 
which the related service is provided.

Mortgage fees and related income
This revenue category reflects CCB’s Home Lending 
production and net mortgage servicing revenue. 
Production revenue includes fees and income recognized as 
earned on mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell, 
and the impact of risk management activities associated 
with the mortgage pipeline and warehouse loans. 
Production revenue also includes gains and losses on sales 
and lower of cost or fair value adjustments on mortgage 
loans held-for-sale (excluding certain repurchased loans 
insured by U.S. government agencies), and changes in the 
fair value of financial instruments measured under the fair 
value option. Net mortgage servicing revenue includes 
operating revenue earned from servicing third-party 
mortgage loans, which is recognized over the period in 
which the service is provided; changes in the fair value of 
MSRs; the impact of risk management activities associated 
with MSRs; and gains and losses on securitization of excess 
mortgage servicing. Net mortgage servicing revenue also 
includes gains and losses on sales and lower of cost or fair 
value adjustments of certain repurchased loans insured by 
U.S. government agencies. 
Refer to Note 15 for further information on risk 
management activities and MSRs. 
Net interest income from mortgage loans is recorded in 
interest income. 
Card income
This revenue category includes interchange and other 
income from credit and debit card transactions; and fees 
earned from processing card transactions for merchants, 
both of which are recognized when purchases are made by 
a cardholder and presented net of certain transactionrelated costs. Card income also includes account origination 
costs and annual fees, which are deferred and recognized 
on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period.
Certain credit card products offer the cardholder the ability 
to earn points based on account activity, which the 
cardholder can choose to redeem for cash and non-cash 
rewards. The cost to the Firm related to these proprietary 
rewards programs varies based on multiple factors 
including the terms and conditions of the rewards 
programs, cardholder activity, cardholder reward 
redemption rates and cardholder reward selections. The 
Firm maintains a liability for its obligations under its 
rewards programs and reports the current-period cost as a 
reduction of card income. 
Credit card revenue sharing agreements 
The Firm has contractual agreements with numerous cobrand partners that grant the Firm exclusive rights to issue 
co-branded credit card products and market them to the 
customers of such partners. These partners endorse the cobrand credit card programs and provide their customer or 
member lists to the Firm. The partners may also conduct 
marketing activities and provide rewards redeemable under 
their own loyalty programs that the Firm will grant to cobrand credit cardholders based on account activity. The 
terms of these agreements generally range from five to ten 
years.
The Firm typically makes payments to the co-brand credit 
card partners based on the cost of partners’ marketing 
activities and loyalty program rewards provided to credit 
cardholders, new account originations and sales volumes. 
Payments to partners based on marketing efforts 
undertaken by the partners are expensed by the Firm as 
incurred and reported as marketing expense. Payments for 
partner loyalty program rewards are reported as a 
reduction of card income when incurred. Payments to 
partners based on new credit card account originations are 
accounted for as direct loan origination costs and are 
deferred and recognized as a reduction of card income on a 
straight-line basis over a 12-month period. Payments to 
partners based on sales volumes are reported as a 
reduction of card income when the related interchange 
income is earned.

Other income
This revenue category includes operating lease income, as 
well as losses associated with the Firm’s tax-oriented

First Republic acquisition.
FDIC Special Assessment
In November 2023, the FDIC approved a final rule to 
implement a special assessment intended to recover losses 
to the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) arising from the 
protection of uninsured depositors resulting from the 
systemic risk determination made on March 12, 2023. The 
final rule imposed a special assessment at a quarterly rate 
of 3.36 basis points on insured depository institutions 
whose estimated uninsured deposits were over $5.0 billion 
as of December 31, 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2023, 
the Firm recognized the estimated special assessment 
expense of $2.9 billion (pre-tax).
Refer to Note 32 for additional information on noninterest 
revenue and expense by segment.

Note 7 – Interest income and Interest expense
Interest income and interest expense are recorded in the 
Consolidated statements of income and classified based on 
the nature of the underlying asset or liability.
Interest income and interest expense includes the currentperiod interest accruals for financial instruments measured 
at fair value, except for derivatives and financial 
instruments containing embedded derivatives that would be 
separately accounted for in accordance with U.S. GAAP, 
absent the fair value option election; for those instruments, 
all changes in fair value including any interest elements, are 
primarily reported in principal transactions revenue. For 
financial instruments that are not measured at fair value, 
the related interest is included within interest income or 
interest expense, as applicable.
Interest income on loans and securities include the 
amortization and accretion of purchase premiums and 
discounts, as well as net deferred fees and costs on loans. 
These amounts are deferred in loans and investment 
securities, respectively, and recognized on a level-yield 
basis.
Refer to Notes 10, 11, 12, and 20 for further information 
on accounting for interest income and interest expense 
related to investment securities, securities financing 
activities (i.e., securities purchased or sold under resale or 
repurchase agreements; securities borrowed; and securities 
loaned), loans and long-term debt, respectively.

Note 8 – Pension and other postretirement 
employee benefit plans 
The Firm has various defined benefit pension plans and 
OPEB plans that provide benefits to its employees in the 
U.S. and certain non-U.S. locations. Substantially all the 
defined benefit pension plans are closed to new 
participants. The principal defined benefit pension plan in 
the U.S., which covered substantially all U.S. employees, 
was closed to new participants and frozen for existing 
participants on January 1, 2020, (and January 1, 2019 for 
new hires on or after December 2, 2017). Interest credits 
continue to accrue to participants’ accounts based on their 
accumulated balances.
The Firm maintains funded and unfunded postretirement 
benefit plans that provide medical and life insurance for 
certain eligible employees and retirees as well as their 
dependents covered under these programs. None of these 
plans have a material impact on the Firm’s Consolidated 
Financial Statements. 
The Firm also provides a qualified defined contribution plan 
in the U.S. and maintains other similar arrangements in 
certain non-U.S. locations. The most significant of these 
plans is the JPMorgan Chase 401(k) Savings Plan (“the 
401(k) Savings Plan”), which covers substantially all U.S. 
employees. Employees can contribute to the 401(k) Savings 
Plan on a pretax and/or Roth 401(k) after-tax basis. The 
Firm makes annual matching and pay credit contributions 
to the 401(k) Savings Plan on behalf of eligible 
participants. 
The following table presents the pretax benefit obligations, plan assets, the net funded status, and the amounts recorded in 
AOCI on the Consolidated balance sheets for the Firm’s significant defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.

The weighted-average discount rate used to value the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, was 5.16% and 
5.14%, respectively.
Gains and losses
Gains or losses resulting from changes in the benefit 
obligation and the fair value of plan assets are recorded in 
OCI. Amortization of net gains or losses are recognized as 
part of the net periodic benefit cost over subsequent 
periods, if, as of the beginning of the year, the net gain or 
loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit 
obligation or the fair value of the plan assets. Amortization 
is generally over the average expected remaining lifetime of 
plan participants, given the frozen status of most plans. For 
the year ended December 31, 2023, the net gain was 
attributable to market-driven increases in the fair value of 
plan assets, partially offset by changes in the discount rate 
and interest crediting rate. During the year ended 
December 31, 2022, a remeasurement of the Firm’s U.S. 
principal defined benefit plan in the third quarter, was 
required as a result of a pension settlement. The 
remeasurement resulted in a reduction in the fair value of 
the Firm’s U.S. principal defined benefit plan assets, 
reflecting market conditions at the time of remeasurement, 
and a reduction in the plan’s projected benefit obligation 
totaling $4.0 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, resulting 
in a net decrease of $1.4 billion in pre-tax AOCI. 
The following table presents the net periodic benefit costs reported in the Consolidated statements of income for the Firm’s 
defined benefit pension, defined contribution and OPEB plans, and in other comprehensive income for the defined benefit 
pension and OPEB plans.

Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets

Plan assumptions
The Firm’s expected long-term rate of return is a blended 
weighted average, by asset allocation of the projected longterm returns for the various asset classes, taking into 
consideration local market conditions and the specific 
allocation of plan assets. Returns on asset classes are 
developed using a forward-looking approach and are not 
strictly based on historical returns, with consideration given 
to current market conditions and the portfolio mix of each 
plan. 
The discount rates used in determining the benefit 
obligations are generally provided by the Firm’s actuaries, 
with the Firm’s principal defined benefit pension plan using 
a rate that was selected by reference to the yields on 
portfolios of bonds with maturity dates and coupons that 
closely match each of the plan’s projected cash flows. 
Investment strategy and asset allocation
The assets of the Firm’s defined benefit pension plans are 
held in various trusts and are invested in well-diversified 
portfolios of equity and fixed income securities, cash and 
cash equivalents, and alternative investments. The Firm 
regularly reviews the asset allocations and asset managers, 
as well as other factors that could impact the portfolios, 
which are rebalanced when deemed necessary. As of 
December 31, 2023, the approved asset allocation ranges 
by asset class for the Firm’s principal defined benefit plan 
are 42-100% debt securities, 0-40% equity securities, 
0-2% real estate, and 0-10% alternatives.
Assets held by the Firm’s defined benefit pension and OPEB 
plans do not include securities issued by JPMorgan Chase or 
its affiliates, except through indirect exposures through 
investments in exchange traded funds, mutual funds and 
collective investment funds managed by third-parties. The 
defined benefit pension and OPEB plans hold investments 
that are sponsored or managed by affiliates of JPMorgan 
Chase in the amount of $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion, as of 
December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Note 9 – Employee share-based incentives
Employee share-based awards
In 2023, 2022 and 2021, JPMorgan Chase granted longterm share-based awards to certain employees under its 
LTIP, as amended and restated effective May 15, 2018, and 
subsequently amended effective May 18, 2021. Under the 
terms of the LTIP, as of December 31, 2023, 54 million 
shares of common stock were available for issuance 
through May 2025. The LTIP is the only active plan under 
which the Firm is currently granting share-based incentive 
awards. In the following discussion, the LTIP, plus prior Firm 
plans and plans assumed as the result of acquisitions, are 
referred to collectively as the “LTI Plans,” and such plans 
constitute the Firm’s share-based incentive plans. 
RSUs are awarded at no cost to the recipient upon their 
grant. Generally, RSUs are granted annually and vest at a 
rate of 50% after two years and 50% after three years and 
are converted into shares of common stock as of the vesting 
date. In addition, RSUs typically include full-career eligibility 
provisions, which allow employees to continue to vest upon 
voluntary termination based on age and/or service-related 
requirements, subject to post-employment and other 
restrictions. All RSU awards are subject to forfeiture until 
vested and contain clawback provisions that may result in 
cancellation under certain specified circumstances. 
Predominantly all RSUs entitle the recipient to receive cash 
payments equivalent to any dividends paid on the 
underlying common stock during the period the RSUs are 
outstanding. 
Performance share units (“PSUs”) are granted annually, 
and approved by the Firm’s Board of Directors, to members 
of the Firm’s Operating Committee under the variable 
compensation program. PSUs are subject to the Firm’s 
achievement of specified performance criteria over a threeyear period. The number of awards that vest can range 
from zero to 150% of the grant amount. In addition, 
dividends that accrue during the vesting period are 
reinvested in dividend equivalent share units. PSUs and the 
related dividend equivalent share units are converted into 
shares of common stock after vesting.
Once the PSUs and dividend equivalent share units have 
vested, the shares of common stock that are delivered, after 
applicable tax withholding, must be retained for an 
additional holding period, for a total combined vesting and 
holding period of approximately five to eight years from the 
grant date depending on regulations in certain countries. 
Under the LTI Plans, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) 
were generally granted with an exercise price equal to the 
fair value of JPMorgan Chase’s common stock on the grant 
date. SARs generally expire ten years after the grant date. 
In 2021, the Firm awarded its Chairman and CEO and its 
President and Chief Operating Officer 1.5 million and 
750,000 SARs, respectively. There were no grants of SARs 
in 2023 or 2022. 
The Firm separately recognizes compensation expense for 
each tranche of each award, net of estimated forfeitures, as 
if it were a separate award with its own vesting date. 
Generally, for each tranche granted, compensation expense 
is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date 
until the vesting date of the respective tranche, provided 
that the employees will not become full-career eligible 
during the vesting period. For awards with full-career 
eligibility provisions and awards granted with no future 
substantive service requirement, the Firm accrues the 
estimated value of awards expected to be awarded to 
employees as of the grant date without giving consideration 
to the impact of post-employment restrictions. For each 
tranche granted to employees who will become full-career 
eligible during the vesting period, compensation expense is 
recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until 
the earlier of the employee’s full-career eligibility date or 
the vesting date of the respective tranche. 
The Firm’s policy for issuing shares upon settlement of 
employee share-based incentive awards is to issue either 
new shares of common stock or treasury shares. During 
2023, 2022 and 2021, the Firm settled all of its employee 
share-based awards by issuing treasury shares. 
Refer to Note 23 for further information on the 
classification of share-based awards for purposes of 
calculating earnings per share.

RSUs, PSUs and SARs activity 
Generally, compensation expense for RSUs and PSUs is measured based on the number of units granted multiplied by the stock 
price at the grant date, and for SARs, is measured at the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Compensation 
expense for these awards is recognized in net income as described previously. The following table summarizes JPMorgan 
Chase’s RSUs, PSUs and SARs activity for 2023.

Note 10 – Investment securities 
Investment securities consist of debt securities that are 
classified as AFS or HTM. Debt securities classified as 
trading assets are discussed in Note 2. Predominantly all of 
the Firm’s AFS and HTM securities are held by Treasury and 
CIO in connection with its asset-liability management 
activities.
AFS securities are carried at fair value on the Consolidated 
balance sheets. Unrealized gains and losses, after any 
applicable hedge accounting adjustments or allowance for 
credit losses, are reported in AOCI. The specific 
identification method is used to determine realized gains 
and losses on AFS securities, which are included in 
investment securities gains/(losses) on the Consolidated 
statements of income. HTM securities, which the Firm has 
the intent and ability to hold until maturity, are carried at 
amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses, on the 
Consolidated balance sheets.
For both AFS and HTM securities, purchase discounts or 
premiums are generally amortized into interest income on a 
level-yield basis over the contractual life of the security. 
However, premiums on certain callable debt securities are 
amortized to the earliest call date. 
Effective January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted the portfolio 
layer method hedge accounting guidance which permitted a 
transfer of HTM securities to AFS upon adoption. The Firm 
transferred obligations of U.S. states and municipalities with 
a carrying value of $7.1 billion resulting in the recognition 
of $38 million net pre-tax unrealized losses in AOCI. Refer 
to Note 1 and Note 24 for additional information.
During 2022, the Firm transferred investment securities 
with a fair value of $78.3 billion from AFS to HTM for capital 
management purposes. AOCI included pretax unrealized 
losses of $4.8 billion on the securities at the date of 
transfer.
Unrealized gains or losses at the date of transfer of these 
securities continue to be reported in AOCI and are amortized 
into interest income on a level-yield basis over the 
remaining life of the securities. This amortization will offset 
the effect on interest income of the amortization of the 
premium or discount resulting from the transfer recorded at 
fair value. 
Transfers of securities between AFS and HTM are non-cash 
transactions.

(d) Excludes $2.8 billion and $2.5 billion of accrued interest receivable at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, included in accrued interest and 
accounts receivable on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm generally does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest 
receivable, consistent with its policy to write them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income. The Firm did not reverse through 
interest income any accrued interest receivable for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.
(e) As of December 31, 2023, included $24.2 billion of AFS securities associated with First Republic. Refer to Note 34 for additional information.
At December 31, 2023, the investment securities portfolio 
consisted of debt securities with an average credit rating of 
AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, and 
where not available, based primarily upon internal risk 
ratings). Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality 
of securities and differentiate risk within the portfolio. The 
Firm’s internal risk ratings generally align with the 
qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet 
financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the 
economic environment) defined by S&P and Moody’s, 
however the quantitative characteristics (e.g., probability of 
default (“PD”) and loss given default (“LGD”)) may differ as 
they reflect internal historical experiences and 
assumptions. Risk ratings are assigned at acquisition, 
reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk 
Management and adjusted as necessary over the life of the 
investment for updated information affecting the issuer’s 
ability to fulfill its obligations.

AFS securities are considered impaired if the fair value is 
less than the amortized cost. 
The Firm recognizes impairment losses in earnings if the 
Firm has the intent to sell the debt security, or if it is more 
likely than not that the Firm will be required to sell the debt 
security before recovery of its amortized cost. In these 
circumstances the impairment loss is recognized in 
investment securities gains/(losses) in the Consolidated 
Statements of Income and is equal to the full difference 
between the amortized cost (net of allowance if applicable) 
and the fair value of the security. 
For impaired debt securities that the Firm has the intent 
and ability to hold, the securities are evaluated to 
determine if a credit loss exists. If it is determined that a 
credit loss exists, that loss is recognized as an allowance for 
credit losses through the provision for credit losses in the 
Consolidated Statements of Income, limited by the amount 
of impairment. Any impairment on debt securities that the 
Firm has the intent and ability to hold not due to credit 
losses is recorded in OCI. 
Factors considered in evaluating credit losses include 
adverse conditions specifically related to the industry, 
geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or 
underlying collateral of a security; and payment structure of 
the security. 
When assessing securities issued in a securitization for 
credit losses, the Firm estimates cash flows considering 
relevant market and economic data, underlying loan-level 
data, and structural features of the securitization, such as 
subordination, excess spread, overcollateralization or other 
forms of credit enhancement, and compares the losses 
projected for the underlying collateral (“pool losses”) 
against the level of credit enhancement in the securitization 
structure to determine whether these features are sufficient 
to absorb the pool losses, or whether a credit loss exists. 
For beneficial interests in securitizations that are rated 
below “AA” at their acquisition, or that can be contractually 
prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the Firm 
would not recover substantially all of its recorded 
investment, the Firm evaluates impairment for credit losses 
when there is an adverse change in expected cash flows. 
HTM securities – credit risk
Allowance for credit losses
The allowance for credit losses on HTM securities 
represents expected credit losses over the remaining 
expected life of the securities.
The allowance for credit losses on HTM obligations of U.S. 
states and municipalities and commercial mortgage-backed 
securities is calculated by applying statistical credit loss 
factors (estimated PD and LGD) to the amortized cost. The 
credit loss factors are derived using a weighted average of 
five internally developed eight-quarter macroeconomic 
scenarios, followed by a single year straight-line 
interpolation to revert to long run historical information for 
periods beyond the forecast period. Refer to Note 13 for 
further information on the eight-quarter macroeconomic 
forecast. 
The allowance for credit losses on HTM collateralized loan 
obligations and U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities
is calculated as the difference between the amortized cost 
and the present value of the cash flows expected to be 
collected, discounted at the security’s effective interest 
rate. These cash flow estimates are developed based on 
expectations of underlying collateral performance derived 
using the eight-quarter macroeconomic forecast and the 
single year straight-line interpolation, as well as considering 
the structural features of the security. 
The application of different inputs and assumptions into the 
calculation of the allowance for credit losses is subject to 
significant management judgment, and emphasizing one 
input or assumption over another, or considering other 
inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of the 
allowance for credit losses on HTM securities. 
Credit quality indicator
The primary credit quality indicator for HTM securities is the 
risk rating assigned to each security. At December 31, 
2023 and 2022, all HTM securities were rated investment 
grade and were current and accruing, with approximately 
99% and 98% rated at least AA+, respectively.
Allowance for credit losses on investment securities
The allowance for credit losses on investment securities was 
$128 million, $96 million and $42 million as of 
December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which 
included a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained 
earnings related to the transfer of HTM securities to AFS for 
the year ended December 31, 2023.

(a) Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted based on the amortized cost of each security. 
The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives, 
including closed portfolio hedges. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; 
and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for 
certain callable debt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date.
(b) For purposes of this table, the amortized cost of available-for-sale securities excludes the allowance for credit losses of $34 million and the portfolio layer 
fair value hedge basis adjustments of $73 million at December 31, 2023. The amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities also excludes the allowance for 
credit losses of $94 million at December 31, 2023.
(c) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. The 
estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately seven years for agency residential MBS, seven years for 
agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations, and six years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.
(d) Includes AFS securities associated with First Republic, primarily due after 10 years. Refer to Note 34 for additional information.

Note 11 – Securities financing activities
JPMorgan Chase enters into resale, repurchase, securities 
borrowed and securities loaned agreements (collectively, 
“securities financing agreements”) primarily to finance the 
Firm’s inventory positions, acquire securities to cover short 
sales, accommodate customers’ financing needs, settle 
other securities obligations and to deploy the Firm’s excess 
cash. 
Securities financing agreements are treated as 
collateralized financings on the Firm’s Consolidated balance 
sheets. Where appropriate under applicable accounting 
guidance, securities financing agreements with the same 
counterparty are reported on a net basis. Refer to Note 1 
for further discussion of the offsetting of assets and 
liabilities. Fees received and paid in connection with 
securities financing agreements are recorded over the life 
of the agreement in interest income and interest expense 
on the Consolidated statements of income. 
The Firm has elected the fair value option for certain 
securities financing agreements. Refer to Note 3 for further 
information regarding the fair value option. The securities 
financing agreements for which the fair value option has 
been elected are reported within securities purchased 
under resale agreements, securities loaned or sold under 
repurchase agreements, and securities borrowed on the 
Consolidated balance sheets. Generally, for agreements 
carried at fair value, current-period interest accruals are 
recorded within interest income and interest expense, with 
changes in fair value reported in principal transactions 
revenue. However, for financial instruments containing 
embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted 
for in accordance with accounting guidance for hybrid 
instruments, all changes in fair value, including any interest 
elements, are reported in principal transactions revenue. 
Securities financing agreements not elected under the fair 
value option are measured at amortized cost. As a result of 
the Firm’s credit risk mitigation practices described below, 
the Firm did not hold any allowance for credit losses with 
respect to resale and securities borrowed arrangements as 
of December 31, 2023 and 2022.
Credit risk mitigation practices
Securities financing agreements expose the Firm primarily 
to credit and liquidity risk. To manage these risks, the Firm 
monitors the value of the underlying securities 
(predominantly high-quality securities collateral, including 
government-issued debt and U.S. GSEs and government 
agencies MBS) that it has received from or provided to its 
counterparties compared to the value of cash proceeds and 
exchanged collateral, and either requests additional 
collateral or returns securities or collateral when 
appropriate. Margin levels are initially established based 
upon the counterparty, the type of underlying securities, 
and the permissible collateral, and are monitored on an 
ongoing basis. 
In resale and securities borrowed agreements, the Firm is 
exposed to credit risk to the extent that the value of the 
securities received is less than initial cash principal 
advanced and any collateral amounts exchanged. In 
repurchase and securities loaned agreements, credit risk 
exposure arises to the extent that the value of underlying 
securities advanced exceeds the value of the initial cash 
principal received, and any collateral amounts exchanged. 
Additionally, the Firm typically enters into master netting 
agreements and other similar arrangements with its 
counterparties, which provide for the right to liquidate the 
underlying securities and any collateral amounts exchanged 
in the event of a counterparty default. It is also the Firm’s 
policy to take possession, where possible, of the securities 
underlying resale and securities borrowed agreements. 
Refer to Note 29 for further information regarding assets 
pledged and collateral received in securities financing 
agreements.
Notes to consolidated financial statements

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of 
the Firm’s securities financing agreements, as of 
December 31, 2023 and 2022. When the Firm has obtained 
an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master 
netting agreement with a counterparty and where other 
relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm 
nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances 
outstanding under its securities financing agreements with 
the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges 
securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to 
reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but 
such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance 
sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an 
appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty 
master netting agreement, such collateral, along with 
securities financing balances that do not meet all these 
relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in 
the table below as “Amounts not nettable on the 
Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net 
amounts” presented. Where a legal opinion has not been 
either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances 
are presented gross in the “Net amounts” below. In 
transactions where the Firm is acting as the lender in a 
securities-for-securities lending agreement and receives 
securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral, the Firm 
recognizes the securities received at fair value within other 
assets and the obligation to return those securities within 
accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated 
balance sheets.

Note 12 – Loans
Loan accounting framework
The accounting for a loan depends on management’s 
strategy for the loan. The Firm accounts for loans based on 
the following categories:
Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., 
“retained”)
Loans held-for-sale
Loans at fair value
The following provides a detailed accounting discussion of 
the Firm’s loans by category:
Loans held-for-investment
Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment, 
including PCD, are recorded at amortized cost, reflecting 
the principal amount outstanding, net of the following: 
unamortized deferred loan fees, costs, premiums or 
discounts; charge-offs; collection of cash; and foreign 
exchange. Credit card loans also include billed finance 
charges and fees.
Interest income
Interest income on performing loans held-for-investment is 
accrued and recognized as interest income at the 
contractual rate of interest. Purchase price discounts or 
premiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs, are 
recognized in interest income over the contractual life of 
the loan as an adjustment of yield.
The Firm classifies accrued interest on loans, including 
accrued but unbilled interest on credit card loans, in 
accrued interest and accounts receivables on the 
Consolidated balance sheets. For credit card loans, accrued 
interest once billed is then recognized in the loan balances, 
with the related allowance recorded in the allowance for 
credit losses. Changes in the allowance for credit losses on 
accrued interest on credit card loans are recognized in the 
provision for credit losses and charge-offs are recognized 
by reversing interest income. For other loans, the Firm 
generally does not recognize an allowance for credit losses 
on accrued interest receivables, consistent with its policy to 
write them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing 
interest income. 
Nonaccrual loans 
Nonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest 
has been suspended. Loans (other than credit card loans 
and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government 
agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status and considered 
nonperforming when full payment of principal and interest 
is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when 
principal and interest has been in default for a period of 90 
days or more, unless the loan is both well-secured and in 
the process of collection. A loan is determined to be past 
due when the minimum payment is not received from the 
borrower by the contractually specified due date or for 
certain loans (e.g., residential real estate loans), when a 
monthly payment is due and unpaid for 30 days or more. 
Finally, collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained 
on nonaccrual status. 
On the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all 
interest accrued but not collected is reversed against 
interest income. In addition, the amortization of deferred 
amounts is suspended. Interest income on nonaccrual loans 
may be recognized as cash interest payments are received 
(i.e., on a cash basis) if the recorded loan balance is 
deemed fully collectible; however, if there is doubt 
regarding the ultimate collectibility of the recorded loan 
balance, all interest cash receipts are applied to reduce the 
carrying value of the loan (the cost recovery method). For 
consumer loans, application of this policy typically results in 
the Firm recognizing interest income on nonaccrual 
consumer loans on a cash basis.
A loan may be returned to accrual status when repayment is 
reasonably assured and there has been demonstrated 
performance under the terms of the loan or, if applicable, 
the terms of the restructured loan. 
As permitted by regulatory guidance, credit card loans are 
generally exempt from being placed on nonaccrual status; 
accordingly, interest and fees related to credit card loans 
continue to accrue until the loan is charged off or paid in 
full. 
Allowance for loan losses 
The allowance for loan losses represents the estimated 
expected credit losses in the held-for-investment loan 
portfolio at the balance sheet date and is recognized on the 
balance sheet as a contra asset, which brings the amortized 
cost to the net carrying value. Changes in the allowance for 
loan losses are recorded in the provision for credit losses on 
the Firm’s Consolidated statements of income. Refer to 
Note 13 for further information on the Firm’s accounting 
policies for the allowance for loan losses. 
Charge-offs 
Consumer loans are generally charged off or charged down 
to the lower of the amortized cost or the net realizable 
value of the underlying collateral (i.e., fair value less 
estimated costs to sell), with an offset to the allowance for 
loan losses, upon reaching specified stages of delinquency 
in accordance with standards established by the FFIEC. 
Residential real estate loans, unmodified credit card loans 
and scored business banking loans are generally charged 
off no later than 180 days past due. Scored auto and 
closed-end consumer loans, including modified credit card 
accounts placed on a fixed payment plan, are charged off 
no later than 120 days past due. 
Certain consumer loans are charged off or charged down to 
their net realizable value earlier than the FFIEC charge-off 
standards in the following circumstances: 
Loans modified to borrowers experiencing financial 
difficulty that are determined to be collateraldependent. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

Loans to borrowers who have experienced an event that 
suggests a loss is either known or highly certain are 
subject to accelerated charge-off standards (e.g., 
residential real estate and auto loans are charged off or 
charged down within 60 days of receiving notification of 
a bankruptcy filing). 
Auto loans upon repossession of the automobile. 
Other than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm 
typically does not recognize charge-offs on the governmentguaranteed portion of loans. 
Wholesale loans are charged off when it is highly certain 
that a loss has been realized. The determination of whether 
to recognize a charge-off includes many factors, including 
the prioritization of the Firm’s claim in bankruptcy, 
expectations of the workout/restructuring of the loan and 
valuation of the borrower’s equity or the loan collateral. 
When a loan is charged down to the lower of its amortized 
cost or the estimated net realizable value of the underlying 
collateral, the determination of the fair value of the 
collateral depends on the type of collateral (e.g., securities, 
real estate). In cases where the collateral is in the form of 
liquid securities, the fair value is based on quoted market 
prices or broker quotes. For illiquid securities or other 
financial assets, the fair value of the collateral is generally 
estimated using a discounted cash flow model. 
For residential real estate loans, collateral values are based 
upon external valuation sources. When it becomes likely 
that a borrower is either unable or unwilling to pay, the 
Firm utilizes a broker’s price opinion, appraisal and/or an 
automated valuation model of the home based on an 
exterior-only valuation (“exterior opinions”), which is then 
updated at least every 12 months, or more frequently 
depending on various market factors. As soon as practicable 
after the Firm receives the property in satisfaction of a debt 
(e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession), the Firm 
generally obtains an appraisal based on an inspection that 
includes the interior of the home (“interior appraisals”). 
Exterior opinions and interior appraisals are discounted 
based upon the Firm’s experience with actual liquidation 
values as compared with the estimated values provided by 
exterior opinions and interior appraisals, considering statespecific factors. 
For commercial real estate loans, collateral values are 
generally based on appraisals from internal and external 
valuation sources. Collateral values are typically updated 
every six to twelve months, either by obtaining a new 
appraisal or by performing an internal analysis, in 
accordance with the Firm’s policies. The Firm also considers 
both borrower- and market-specific factors, which may 
result in obtaining appraisal updates or broker price 
opinions at more frequent intervals.
Loans held-for-sale 
Loans held-for-sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair 
value, with valuation changes recorded in noninterest 
revenue. For consumer loans, the valuation is performed on 
a portfolio basis. For wholesale loans, the valuation is 
performed on an individual loan basis. 
Interest income on loans held-for-sale is accrued and 
recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. 
Loan origination fees or costs and purchase price discounts 
or premiums are deferred in a contra loan account until the 
related loan is sold. The deferred fees or costs and 
discounts or premiums are an adjustment to the basis of the 
loan and therefore are included in the periodic 
determination of the lower of cost or fair value adjustments 
and/or the gain or loss recognized at the time of sale. 
Because these loans are recognized at the lower of cost or 
fair value, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses and chargeoff policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans 
held-for-sale are subject to the Firm’s nonaccrual policies. 
Loans at fair value 
Loans for which the fair value option has been elected are 
measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded 
in noninterest revenue. 
Interest income on these loans is accrued and recognized 
based on the contractual rate of interest. Changes in fair 
value are recognized in noninterest revenue. Loan 
origination fees are recognized upfront in noninterest 
revenue. Loan origination costs are recognized in the 
associated expense category as incurred. 
Because these loans are recognized at fair value, the Firm’s 
allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not 
apply to these loans. However, loans at fair value are 
subject to the Firm’s nonaccrual policies. 
Refer to Note 3 for further information on the Firm’s 
elections of fair value accounting under the fair value 
option. Refer to Note 2 and Note 3 for further information 
on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading 
assets.

Loan classification changes 
Loans in the held-for-investment portfolio that 
management decides to sell are transferred to the held-forsale portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value on the date 
of transfer. Credit-related losses are charged against the 
allowance for loan losses; non-credit related losses such as 
those due to changes in interest rates or foreign currency 
exchange rates are recognized in noninterest revenue. 
In the event that management decides to retain a loan in 
the held-for-sale portfolio, the loan is transferred to the 
held-for-investment portfolio at amortized cost on the date 
of transfer. These loans are subsequently assessed for 
impairment based on the Firm’s allowance methodology. 
Refer to Note 13 for a further discussion of the 
methodologies used in establishing the Firm’s allowance for 
loan losses. 
Loan modifications 
The Firm seeks to modify certain loans in conjunction with 
its loss mitigation activities. Through the modification, 
JPMorgan Chase grants one or more concessions to a 
borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty in order to 
minimize the Firm’s economic loss and avoid foreclosure or 
repossession of the collateral, and to ultimately maximize 
payments received by the Firm from the borrower. The 
concessions granted vary by program and by borrowerspecific characteristics, and may include interest rate 
reductions, term extensions, other-than-insignificant 
payment delays or principal forgiveness. Effective January 
1, 2023 the Firm adopted the Financial Instruments - Credit 
Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage 
Disclosure accounting guidance, which changed the 
accounting for loan modifications from TDRs to FDMs. Refer 
to Note 1 for further information. 
Loans, except for credit card loans, reported as FDMs are 
generally placed on nonaccrual status, although in many 
cases such loans were already on nonaccrual status prior to 
modification. These loans may be returned to performing 
status (the accrual of interest is resumed) if the following 
criteria are met: (i) the borrower has performed under the 
modified terms for a minimum of six months and/or six 
payments, and (ii) the Firm has an expectation that 
repayment of the modified loan is reasonably assured based 
on, for example, the borrower’s debt capacity and level of 
future earnings, collateral values, LTV ratios, and other 
current market considerations. In certain limited and welldefined circumstances in which the loan is current at the 
modification date, such loans are not placed on nonaccrual 
status at the time of modification. 
The allowance for credit losses associated with FDMs is 
measured using the Firm’s established allowance 
methodology, which considers the expected re-default rates 
for the modified loans. Refer to Note 13 for further 
discussion. 
For periods ending prior to January 1, 2023, modifications 
of loans where the Firm granted concessions to a borrower 
experiencing financial difficulty were accounted for and 
reported as TDRs. The concessions granted varied by 
program and by borrower-specific characteristics, and 
included interest rate reductions, term extensions, payment 
delays, principal forgiveness, or the acceptance of equity or 
other assets in lieu of payments. Loans with short-term and 
other insignificant modifications that were not considered 
concessions were not TDRs.
Loans modified in TDRs were generally measured for 
impairment using the Firm’s established asset-specific 
allowance methodology, which considers the expected 
redefault rates for the modified loans. A loan modified in a 
TDR generally remained subject to the asset-specific 
component of the allowance throughout its remaining life, 
regardless of whether the loan was performing and had 
been returned to accrual status. Refer to Note 13 for 
further discussion.
Foreclosed property 
The Firm acquires property from borrowers through loan 
restructurings, workouts, and foreclosures. Property 
acquired may include real property (e.g., residential real 
estate, land, and buildings) and other commercial and 
personal property (e.g., automobiles, aircraft, railcars, and 
ships). 
The Firm recognizes foreclosed property upon receiving 
assets in satisfaction of a loan (e.g., by taking legal title or 
physical possession). For loans collateralized by real 
property, the Firm generally recognizes the asset received 
at foreclosure sale or upon the execution of a deed in lieu of 
foreclosure transaction with the borrower. Foreclosed 
assets are reported in other assets on the Consolidated 
balance sheets and initially recognized at fair value less 
estimated costs to sell. Each quarter the fair value of the 
acquired property is reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, to 
the lower of cost or fair value. Subsequent adjustments to 
fair value are charged/credited to noninterest revenue. 
Operating expense, such as real estate taxes and 
maintenance, are charged to other expense.

Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolio
Consumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist 
primarily of scored residential mortgages, home equity 
loans and lines of credit, auto and business banking loans, 
with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market. 
These loans include home equity loans secured by junior 
liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only payment 
period, and certain payment-option loans that may result in 
negative amortization. 
The following table provides information about retained 
consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class.

Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator 
for consumer loans. Loans that are more than 30 days past 
due provide an early warning of borrowers who may be 
experiencing financial difficulties and/or who may be 
unable or unwilling to repay the loan. As the loan continues 
to age, it becomes more clear whether the borrower is likely 
to be unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of residential 
real estate loans, late-stage delinquencies (greater than 
150 days past due) are a strong indicator of loans that will 
ultimately result in a foreclosure or similar liquidation 
transaction. In addition to delinquency rates, other credit 
quality indicators for consumer loans vary based on the 
class of loan, as follows: 
For residential real estate loans, the current estimated 
LTV ratio, or the combined LTV ratio in the case of junior 
lien loans, is an indicator of the potential loss severity in 
the event of default. Additionally, LTV or combined LTV 
ratios can provide insight into a borrower’s continued 
willingness to pay, as the delinquency rate of high-LTV 
loans tends to be greater than that for loans where the 
borrower has equity in the collateral. The geographic 
distribution of the loan collateral also provides insight as 
to the credit quality of the portfolio, as factors such as 
the regional economy, home price changes and specific 
events such as natural disasters, will affect credit 
quality. The borrower’s current or “refreshed” FICO 
score is a secondary credit quality indicator for certain 
loans, as FICO scores are an indication of the borrower’s 
credit payment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower with a 
low FICO score (less than 660) is considered to be of 
higher risk than a loan to a borrower with a higher FICO 
score. Further, a loan to a borrower with a high LTV 
ratio and a low FICO score is at greater risk of default 
than a loan to a borrower that has both a high LTV ratio 
and a high FICO score.
For scored auto and business banking loans, geographic 
distribution is an indicator of the credit performance of 
the portfolio. Similar to residential real estate loans, 
geographic distribution provides insights into the 
portfolio performance based on regional economic 
activity and events.

(f) Purchased loans are included in the year in which they were originated.
Approximately 37% of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans. The lien 
position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm’s allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have been converted to 
term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period. That is primarily because the 
fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options available 
for revolving loans within the revolving period.

(a) Includes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged down to the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm 
reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed 
by the borrower (“Chapter 7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual loans, regardless of their delinquency status. At December 31, 2023, 
approximately 9% of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due.
(b) Mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies excluded from nonaccrual loans were not material at December 31, 2023 and 2022.
(c) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered 
collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of 
the underlying collateral improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.
(d) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $180 million and $175 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, 
respectively.
(e) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
(f) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a 
minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the 
extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all 
available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.
(g) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.
(h) Includes residential real estate loans, primarily held in LLCs in AWM that did not have a refreshed FICO score. These loans have been included in a FICO 
band based on management’s estimation of the borrower’s credit quality.
(i) Included U.S. government-guaranteed loans as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.
(j) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.
(k) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at December 31, 2023.
(l) Included $1.1 billion in equal to or greater than 660 FICO scores within 80% to 100% LTV ratio, and $87.9 billion and $1.1 billion in equal to or greater 
than 660 and less than 660 FICO scores, respectively, within less than 80% LTV ratio associated with First Republic.
(m) Included $90.7 billion of loans associated with First Republic.
(n) Included $54.9 billion, $14.9 billion, $3.5 billion, and $7.8 billion in California, New York, Florida and Massachusetts, respectively, associated with First 
Republic.

Loan modifications 
The Firm grants certain modifications of residential real 
estate loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, 
which effective January 1, 2023, are reported as FDMs. The 
Firm's proprietary modification programs as well as 
government programs, including U.S. GSE programs, that 
generally provide various modifications to borrowers 
experiencing financial difficulty including, but not limited 
to, interest rate reductions, term extensions, other-thaninsignificant payment delay and principal forgiveness that 
would otherwise have been required under the terms of the 
original agreement, are considered FDMs.
Financial effects of FDMs
For the year ended December 31, 2023, residential real 
estate FDMs were $136 million. The financial effects of the 
FDMs, which were predominantly in the form of term 
extensions and interest rate reductions, included extending 
the weighted-average life of the loans by 20 years, and 
reducing the weighted-average contractual interest rate 
from 7.21% to 4.44% for the year ended December 31, 
2023. There were no additional commitments to lend to 
borrowers experiencing financial difficulty whose loans 
have been modified as FDMs.
In addition to FDMs, the Firm also had $69 million of loans 
subject to a trial modification, and $9 million of Chapter 7 
loans for the year ended December 31, 2023. The changes 
to the TDR accounting guidance eliminated the TDR 
reasonably expected and concession assessment criteria. 
Accordingly, trial modifications and Chapter 7 loans were 
considered TDRs, but not FDMs. Refer to Note 1 for further 
information.
Payment status of FDMs and redefaults
For the year ended December 31, 2023, residential real 
estate FDMs of $29 million were 30 or more days past due 
and FDMs that re-defaulted were $17 million.
Nature and extent of TDRs
For periods ending prior to January 1, 2023, modifications 
of residential real estate loans where the Firm granted 
concessions to borrowers who were experiencing financial 
difficulty were generally accounted for and reported as 
TDRs. Loans with short-term or other insignificant 
modifications that were not considered concessions were 
not TDRs. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 
2021, new TDRs were $362 million and $866 million, and 
there were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers 
whose residential real estate loans were modified in TDRs. 
The Firm’s proprietary modification programs as well as 
government programs, including U.S. GSE programs, 
generally provide various concessions to financially 
troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest 
rate reductions, term or payment extensions and delays of 
principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise 
have been required under the terms of the original 
agreement. 
The following table provides information about how 
residential real estate loans were modified in TDRs during 
the period presented. This table excludes loans with shortterm or other insignificant modifications that are not 
considered concessions.

granted on permanent modifications.
(b) Includes variable interest rate to fixed interest rate modifications and 
payment delays that meet the definition of a TDR. 
Financial effects of TDRs and redefaults
The following table provides information about the financial 
effects of the various concessions granted in modifications 
of residential real estate loans and about redefaults of 
certain loans modified in TDRs for the periods presented.

Active and suspended foreclosure 
At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Firm had residential 
real estate loans, excluding those insured by U.S. 
government agencies, with a carrying value of $566 million 
and $565 million, respectively, that were not included in 
REO, but were in the process of active or suspended 
foreclosure.

million and $101 million, respectively, of PPP loans 90 or more days 
past due and guaranteed by the SBA, of which $15 million and $76 
million, respectively, were no longer accruing interest based on the 
guidelines set by the SBA. Typically the principal balance of the loans is 
insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate 
subject to meeting the guidelines set by the SBA. There were no loans 
that were not guaranteed by the SBA that are 90 or more days past 
due and still accruing interest at December 31, 2023 and 2022. 
(b) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In 
accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that 
are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the 
lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral 
less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral improves 
subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.
(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was

(d) The geographic regions presented in this table are ordered based on

Loan modifications 
The Firm grants certain modifications of auto and other 
loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, which 
effective January 1, 2023, are reported as FDMs. For the 
year ended December 31, 2023, auto and other FDMs 
were not material and there were no additional 
commitments to lend to borrowers modified as FDMs.
For periods ending prior to January 1, 2023, modifications 
of auto and other loans where the Firm granted concessions 
to borrowers who were experiencing financial difficulty 
were generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. Loans 
with short-term or other insignificant modifications that 
were not considered concessions were not TDRs. For the 
years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, auto and other 
TDRs were not material.

Credit card loan portfolio
The credit card portfolio segment includes credit card loans 
originated and purchased by the Firm. Delinquency rates 
are the primary credit quality indicator for credit card loans 
as they provide an early warning that borrowers may be 
experiencing difficulties (30 days past due); information on 
those borrowers that have been delinquent for a longer 
period of time (90 days past due) is also considered. In 
addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of 
the loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the 
portfolio based on the regional economy.
While the borrower’s credit score is another general 
indicator of credit quality, the Firm does not view credit 
scores as a primary indicator of credit quality because the 
borrower’s credit score tends to be a lagging indicator. The 
distribution of such scores provides a general indicator of 
credit quality trends within the portfolio; however, the score 
does not capture all factors that would be predictive of 
future credit performance. Refreshed FICO score 
information, which is obtained at least quarterly, for a 
statistically significant random sample of the credit card 
portfolio is indicated in other credit quality indicators. FICO 
is considered to be the industry benchmark for credit 
scores.
The Firm generally originates new credit card accounts to 
prime consumer borrowers. However, certain cardholders’ 
FICO scores may decrease over time, depending on the 
performance of the cardholder and changes in the credit 
score calculation.

Loan modifications 
The Firm grants certain modifications of credit card loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, which effective 
January 1, 2023, are reported as FDMs. These modifications may involve placing the customer’s credit card account on a fixed 
payment plan, generally for 60 months, which typically includes reducing the interest rate on the credit card account. If the 
borrower does not make the contractual payments when due under the modified payment terms, the credit card loan 
continues to age and will be charged-off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy. In most cases, the Firm does 
not reinstate the borrower's line of credit.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Firm also had $27 million of credit card loans subject to trial modifications. The 
changes to the TDR accounting guidance eliminated the TDR reasonably expected and concession assessment criteria. 
Accordingly, trial modifications are not considered FDMs.

There were $50 million FDMs that re-defaulted during the 
year ended December 31, 2023 which were a combination 
of term extension and interest rate reduction.
For credit card loans modified as FDMs, payment default is 
deemed to have occurred when the borrower misses two 
consecutive contractual payments. Defaulted modified 
credit card loans remain in the modification program and 
continue to be charged off in accordance with the Firm's 
standard charge-off policy.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

Financial effects of TDRs and redefaults 
For periods ending prior to January 1, 2023, modifications 
of credit card loans where the Firm granted concessions to 
borrowers who were experiencing financial difficulty were 
generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. The Firm 
granted concessions for most of the credit card loans under 
long-term programs. These concessions involved placing 
the customer’s credit card account on a fixed payment plan, 
generally for 60 months, and typically included reducing 
the interest rate on the credit card account. Substantially all 
modifications under the Firm’s long-term programs were 
considered to be TDRs. Loans with short-term or other 
insignificant modifications that were not considered 
concessions were not reported as TDRs.
The following table provides information about the financial 
effects of the concessions granted on credit card loans 
modified in TDRs and redefaults for the periods presented.

Wholesale loan portfolio
Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, 
ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to 
high-net-worth individuals.
The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is 
the internal risk rating assigned to each loan. Risk ratings 
are used to identify the credit quality of loans and 
differentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk ratings on loans 
consider the PD and the LGD. The PD is the likelihood that a 
loan will default. The LGD is the estimated loss on the loan 
that would be realized upon the default of the borrower and 
takes into consideration collateral and structural support 
for each credit facility. 
Management considers several factors to determine an 
appropriate internal risk rating, including the obligor’s debt 
capacity and financial flexibility, the level of the obligor’s 
earnings, the amount and sources for repayment, the level 
and nature of contingencies, management strength, and the 
industry and geography in which the obligor operates. The 
Firm’s internal risk ratings generally align with the 
qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet 
financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the 
economic environment) defined by S&P and Moody’s, 
however the quantitative characteristics (e.g., PD and LGD) 
may differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and 
assumptions. The Firm generally considers internal ratings 
with qualitative characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or 
higher as investment grade, and these ratings have a lower 
PD and/or lower LGD than non-investment grade ratings. 
Noninvestment-grade ratings are further classified as 
noncriticized and criticized, and the criticized portion is 
further subdivided into performing and nonaccrual loans, 
representing management’s assessment of the collectibility 
of principal and interest. Criticized loans have a higher PD 
than noncriticized loans. The Firm’s definition of criticized 
aligns with the U.S. banking regulatory definition of 
criticized exposures, which consist of special mention, 
substandard and doubtful categories. Refer to Note 1 for 
additional information. 
Risk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by 
Credit Risk Management and are adjusted as necessary for 
updated information affecting the obligor’s ability to fulfill 
its obligations.
As noted above, the risk rating of a loan considers the 
industry in which the obligor conducts its operations. As 
part of the overall credit risk management framework, the 
Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its 
industry and client exposures, with particular attention paid 
to industries with an actual or potential credit concern. 
Refer to Note 4 for further detail on industry 
concentrations.

Nature and extent of TDRs
Prior to January 1, 2023, certain loan modifications were 
considered TDRs. These loan modifications provided various 
concessions to borrower who were experiencing financial 
difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant 
modifications that were not considered concessions were 
not TDRs nor were loans for which the Firm elected to 
suspend TDR accounting guidance under the option 
provided by the CARES Act.
For the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, new 
TDRs were $801 million and $881 million, respectively. 
New TDRs for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 
2021 reflected extended maturity dates and covenant 
waivers primarily in the Commercial and Industrial loan 
class. For the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, 
the impact of these modifications resulting in new TDRs was 
not material to the Firm. 
As a result of the elimination of the requirement to assess 
whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a 
concession, the population of loans considered FDMs is 
greater than the population previously considered TDRs.

Note 13 – Allowance for credit losses
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents 
management's estimate of expected credit losses over the 
remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets 
measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet 
lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit 
losses generally comprises:
• the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s 
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated), 
• the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is 
presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts 
payable and other liabilities, and 
• the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, 
which is reflected in investment securities on the 
Consolidated balance sheets.
The income statement effect of all changes in the allowance 
for credit losses is recognized in the provision for credit 
losses. 
Determining the appropriateness of the allowance for credit 
losses is complex and requires significant judgment by 
management about the effect of matters that are inherently 
uncertain. At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses 
is reviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller of the 
Firm. Subsequent evaluations of credit exposures, 
considering the macroeconomic conditions, forecasts and 
other factors then prevailing, may result in significant 
changes in the allowance for credit losses in future periods. 
The Firm’s policies used to determine its allowance for loan 
losses and its allowance for lending-related commitments 
are described in the following paragraphs. Refer to Note 10 
for a description of the policies used to determine the 
allowance for credit losses on investment securities. 
Methodology for allowances for loan losses and lendingrelated commitments
The allowance for loan losses and allowance for lendingrelated commitments represents expected credit losses 
over the remaining expected life of retained loans and 
lending-related commitments that are not unconditionally 
cancellable. The Firm does not record an allowance for 
future draws on unconditionally cancellable lending-related 
commitments (e.g., credit cards). Expected losses related to 
accrued interest on credit card loans are considered in the 
Firm’s allowance for loan losses. However, the Firm does 
not record an allowance on other accrued interest 
receivables, due to its policy to write these receivables off 
no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest 
income. 
The expected life of each instrument is determined by 
considering its contractual term, expected prepayments, 
cancellation features, and certain extension and call 
options. The expected life of funded credit card loans is 
generally estimated by considering expected future 
payments on the credit card account, and determining how 
much of those amounts should be allocated to repayments 
of the funded loan balance (as of the balance sheet date) 
versus other account activity. This allocation is made using 
an approach that incorporates the payment application 
requirements of the Credit Card Accountability 
Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, generally paying 
down the highest interest rate balances first. 
The estimate of expected credit losses includes expected 
recoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to 
be charged off, even if such recoveries result in a negative 
allowance. 
Collective and Individual Assessments
When calculating the allowance for loan losses and the 
allowance for lending-related commitments, the Firm 
assesses whether exposures share similar risk 
characteristics. If similar risk characteristics exist, the Firm 
estimates expected credit losses collectively, considering 
the risk associated with a particular pool and the probability 
that the exposures within the pool will deteriorate or 
default. The assessment of risk characteristics is subject to 
significant management judgment. Emphasizing one 
characteristic over another or considering additional 
characteristics could affect the allowance. 
• Relevant risk characteristics for the consumer portfolio 
include product type, delinquency status, current FICO 
scores, geographic distribution, and, for collateralized 
loans, current LTV ratios. 
• Relevant risk characteristics for the wholesale portfolio 
include risk rating, delinquency status, tenor, level and 
type of collateral, LOB, geography, industry, credit 
enhancement, product type, facility purpose, and 
payment terms. 
The majority of the Firm’s credit exposures share risk 
characteristics with other similar exposures, and as a result 
are collectively assessed for impairment (“portfolio-based 
component”). The portfolio-based component covers 
consumer loans, performing risk-rated loans and certain 
lending-related commitments. 
If an exposure does not share risk characteristics with other 
exposures, the Firm generally estimates expected credit 
losses on an individual basis, considering expected 
repayment and conditions impacting that individual 
exposure (“asset-specific component”). The asset-specific 
component covers collateral-dependent loans and riskrated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status. 
Portfolio-based component
The portfolio-based component begins with a quantitative 
calculation that considers the likelihood of the borrower 
changing delinquency status or moving from one risk rating 
to another. The quantitative calculation covers expected 
credit losses over an instrument’s expected life and is 
estimated by applying credit loss factors to the Firm’s 
estimated exposure at default. The credit loss factors 
incorporate the probability of borrower default as well as 
loss severity in the event of default. They are derived using 
a weighted average of five internally developed 
macroeconomic scenarios over an eight-quarter forecast 
period, followed by a single year straight-line interpolation 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

to revert to long run historical information for periods 
beyond the eight-quarter forecast period. The five 
macroeconomic scenarios consist of a central, relative 
adverse, extreme adverse, relative upside and extreme 
upside scenario, and are updated by the Firm’s central 
forecasting team. The scenarios take into consideration the 
Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, internal perspectives from 
subject matter experts across the Firm, and market 
consensus and involve a governed process that incorporates 
feedback from senior management across LOBs, Corporate 
Finance and Risk Management.
The quantitative calculation is adjusted to take into 
consideration model imprecision, emerging risk 
assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are 
not yet reflected in the calculation. These adjustments are 
accomplished in part by analyzing the historical loss 
experience, including during stressed periods, for each 
major product or model. Management applies judgment in 
making this adjustment, including taking into account 
uncertainties associated with the economic and political 
conditions, quality of underwriting standards, borrower 
behavior, credit concentrations or deterioration within an 
industry, product or portfolio, as well as other relevant 
internal and external factors affecting the credit quality of 
the portfolio. In certain instances, the interrelationships 
between these factors create further uncertainties.
The application of different inputs into the quantitative 
calculation, and the assumptions used by management to 
adjust the quantitative calculation, are subject to significant 
management judgment, and emphasizing one input or 
assumption over another, or considering other inputs or 
assumptions, could affect the estimate of the allowance for 
loan losses and the allowance for lending-related 
commitments.
Asset-specific component 
To determine the asset-specific component of the 
allowance, collateral-dependent loans (including those 
loans for which foreclosure is probable) and nonaccrual 
risk-rated loans in the wholesale portfolio segment are 
generally evaluated individually.
On January 1, 2023 the Firm adopted the Financial 
Instruments - Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings 
accounting guidance as described in Note 1.
The adoption of this guidance eliminated the requirement 
to measure the allowance for TDRs using a discounted cash 
flow (DCF) methodology and allowed the option of a nonDCF portfolio-based approach for modified loans to 
borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. If a DCF 
methodology is still applied for these modified loans, the 
discount rate must be the post-modification effective 
interest rate, instead of the pre-modification effective 
interest rate. 
The Firm elected to change from an asset-specific allowance 
approach to its non-DCF, portfolio-based allowance 
approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers for all 
portfolios except collateral-dependent loans and nonaccrual 
risk-rated loans, for which the asset-specific allowance 
approach will continue to apply. The adoption did not 
impact the collateral-dependent allowance approach or 
scope.
This guidance was adopted under the modified 
retrospective method which resulted in a net decrease to 
the allowance for credit losses of $587 million and an 
increase to retained earnings of $446 million, after-tax 
predominantly driven by residential real estate and credit 
card.
For collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of collateral 
less estimated costs to sell, as applicable, is used to 
determine the charge-off amount for declines in value (to 
reduce the amortized cost of the loan to the fair value of 
collateral) or the amount of negative allowance that should 
be recognized (for recoveries of prior charge-offs 
associated with improvements in the fair value of the 
collateral).
For non-collateral dependent loans, the Firm generally 
measures the asset-specific allowance as the difference 
between the amortized cost of the loan and the present 
value of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted 
at the loan’s effective interest rate. Subsequent changes in 
impairment are generally recognized as an adjustment to 
the allowance for loan losses. The asset-specific component 
of the allowance for non-collateral dependent loans 
incorporates the effect of the modification on the loan’s 
expected cash flows including changes in interest rates, 
principal forgiveness, and other concessions, as well as 
management’s expectation of the borrower’s ability to 
repay under the modified terms. 
Estimating the timing and amounts of future cash flows is 
highly judgmental as these cash flow projections rely upon 
estimates such as loss severities, asset valuations, the 
amounts and timing of interest or principal payments 
(including any expected prepayments) or other factors that 
are reflective of current and expected market conditions. 
These estimates are, in turn, dependent on factors such as 
the duration of current overall economic conditions, 
industry, portfolio, or borrower-specific factors, the 
expected outcome of insolvency proceedings as well as, in 
certain circumstances, other economic factors. All of these 
estimates and assumptions require significant management 
judgment and certain assumptions are highly subjective. 
Other financial assets
In addition to loans and investment securities, the Firm 
holds other financial assets that are measured at amortized 
cost on the Consolidated balance sheets, including credit 
exposures arising from lending activities subject to 
collateral maintenance requirements. Management 
estimates the allowance for other financial assets using 
various techniques considering historical losses and current 
economic conditions. 
Credit risk arising from lending activities subject to 
collateral maintenance requirements is generally mitigated 
by factors such as the short-term nature of the activity, the 
Notes to consolidated financial statements

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

fair value of collateral held and the Firm’s right to call for, 
and the borrower’s obligation to provide additional margin 
when the fair value of the collateral declines. Because of 
these mitigating factors, these exposures generally do not 
require an allowance for credit losses. However, 
management may also consider other factors such as the 
borrower’s ongoing ability to provide collateral to satisfy 
margin requirements, or whether collateral is significantly 
concentrated in an individual issuer or in securities with 
similar risk characteristics. If in management’s judgment, 
an allowance for credit losses for these exposures is 
required, the Firm estimates expected credit losses based 
on the value of the collateral and probability of borrower 
default.

Discussion of changes in the allowance
The allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2023 
was $24.8 billion, reflecting a net addition of $3.1 billion 
from December 31, 2022.
The net addition to the allowance for credit losses included 
$1.9 billion, consisting of:
• $1.3 billion in consumer, predominantly driven by CCB, 
comprised of $1.4 billion in Card Services, partially offset 
by a net reduction of $200 million in Home Lending. The 
net addition in Card Services was driven by loan growth, 
including an increase in revolving balances, partially 
offset by reduced borrower uncertainty. The net 
reduction in Home Lending was driven by improvements 
in the outlook for home prices, and 
• $675 million in wholesale, driven by net downgrade 
activity, the net effect of changes in the Firm’s weighted 
average macroeconomic outlook, including deterioration 
in the outlook for commercial real estate in CB, and an 
addition for certain accounts receivable in CIB, partially 
offset by the impact of changes in the loan and lendingrelated commitment portfolios.
The net addition also included $1.2 billion to establish the 
allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related 
commitments in the second quarter of 2023. 
The changes in the Firm's weighted average macroeconomic 
outlook also included updates to the central scenario in the 
third quarter of 2023 to reflect a lower forecasted 
unemployment rate consistent with a higher growth rate in 
GDP, and the impact of the additional weight placed on the 
adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023, reflecting 
elevated recession risks due to high inflation and tightening 
financial conditions. 
The allowance for credit losses also reflected a reduction of 
$587 million as a result of the adoption of changes to the 
TDR accounting guidance on January 1, 2023. Refer to Note 
1 for further information.
The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a 
weighted average of five internally developed 
macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios 
incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the 
central case assumptions provided in the table below, 
resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate 
peaking at 5.5% in the fourth quarter of 2024, and a 
weighted average U.S. real GDP level that is 1.5% lower 
than the central case at the end of the second quarter of 
2025.
The following table presents the Firm’s central case 
assumptions for the periods presented:

Note 14 – Variable interest entities
Refer to Note 1 on page 171 for a further description of the Firm’s accounting policies regarding consolidation of and 
involvement with VIEs. 
The following table summarizes the most significant types of Firm-sponsored VIEs by business segment. The Firm considers a 
“Firm-sponsored” VIE to include any entity where: (1) JPMorgan Chase is the primary beneficiary of the structure; (2) the VIE 
is used by JPMorgan Chase to securitize Firm assets; (3) the VIE issues financial instruments with the JPMorgan Chase name; 
or (4) the entity is a JPMorgan Chase–administered asset-backed commercial paper conduit.

The Firm’s other business segments are also involved with VIEs (both third-party and Firm-sponsored), but to a lesser extent, 
as follows: 
Asset & Wealth Management: AWM sponsors and manages certain funds that are deemed VIEs. As asset manager of the 
funds, AWM earns a fee based on assets managed; the fee varies with each fund’s investment objective and is competitively 
priced. For fund entities that qualify as VIEs, AWM’s interests are, in certain cases, considered to be significant variable 
interests that result in consolidation of the financial results of these entities.
Commercial Banking: CB provides financing and lending-related services to a wide spectrum of clients, including certain 
third-party-sponsored entities that may meet the definition of a VIE. CB does not control the activities of these entities and 
does not consolidate these entities. CB’s maximum loss exposure, regardless of whether the entity is a VIE, is generally 
limited to loans and lending-related commitments which are reported and disclosed in the same manner as any other thirdparty transaction. 
Corporate: Corporate is involved with entities that may meet the definition of VIEs; however these entities are generally 
subject to specialized investment company accounting, which does not require the consolidation of investments, including 
VIEs. In addition, Treasury and CIO invest in securities generally issued by third parties which may meet the definition of 
VIEs (e.g., issuers of asset-backed securities). In general, the Firm does not have the power to direct the significant 
activities of these entities and therefore does not consolidate these entities. Refer to Note 10 for further information on the 
Firm’s investment securities portfolio.
In addition, CIB also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third parties. Refer to page 266 
of this Note for more information on the VIEs sponsored by third parties.
Significant Firm-sponsored VIEs
Credit card securitizations
CCB’s Card Services business may securitize originated 
credit card loans, primarily through the Chase Issuance 
Trust (the “Trust”). The Firm’s continuing involvement in 
credit card securitizations includes servicing the 
receivables, retaining an undivided seller’s interest in the 
receivables, retaining certain senior and subordinated 
securities and maintaining escrow accounts. 
The Firm consolidates the assets and liabilities of its 
sponsored credit card trusts as it is considered to be the 
primary beneficiary of these securitization trusts based on 
the Firm’s ability to direct the activities of these VIEs 
through its servicing responsibilities and other duties, 
including making decisions as to the receivables that are 
transferred into those trusts and as to any related 
modifications and workouts. Additionally, the nature and 
extent of the Firm’s other continuing involvement with the 
trusts, as indicated above, obligates the Firm to absorb 
losses and gives the Firm the right to receive certain 
benefits from these VIEs that could potentially be 
significant. 
The underlying securitized credit card receivables and other 
assets of the securitization trusts are available only for 
payment of the beneficial interests issued by the 
securitization trusts; they are not available to pay the Firm’s 
other obligations or the claims of the Firm’s creditors. 
The agreements with the credit card securitization trusts 
require the Firm to maintain a minimum undivided interest 
in the credit card trusts (generally 5%). As of 
December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Firm held undivided 
interests in Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts 
of $4.9 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively. The Firm 
maintained an average undivided interest in principal 
receivables owned by those trusts of approximately 65% 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

CCB
CIB
CIB

and 62% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 
2022, respectively. The Firm did not retain any senior 
securities and retained $1.5 billion of subordinated 
securities in certain of its credit card securitization trusts at 
both December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Firm’s undivided 
interests in the credit card trusts and securities retained are 
eliminated in consolidation. 
Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts
The Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and 
purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages 
and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB and CIB 
businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well 
as the respective business involved, the Firm may act as the 
servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial 
interests in the securitization trusts.
The following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label securitization 
entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by the Firm. Continuing 
involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or subordinated interests (including amounts required to be 
held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or guarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain 
instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. The Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and 
purchased interests is the carrying value of these interests.

Residential mortgage
The Firm securitizes residential mortgage loans originated 
by CCB, as well as residential mortgage loans purchased 
from third parties by either CCB or CIB. CCB generally 
retains servicing for all residential mortgage loans it 
originated or purchased, and for certain mortgage loans 
purchased by CIB. For securitizations of loans serviced by 
CCB, the Firm has the power to direct the significant 
activities of the VIE because it is responsible for decisions 
related to loan modifications and workouts. CCB may also 
retain an interest upon securitization.
In addition, CIB engages in underwriting and trading 
activities involving securities issued by Firm-sponsored 
securitization trusts. As a result, CIB at times retains senior 
and/or subordinated interests (including residual interests 
and amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk 
retention rules) in residential mortgage securitizations at 
the time of securitization, and/or reacquires positions in the 
secondary market in the normal course of business. In 
certain instances, as a result of the positions retained or 
reacquired by CIB or held by Treasury and CIO or CCB, when 
considered together with the servicing arrangements 
entered into by CCB, the Firm is deemed to be the primary 
beneficiary of certain securitization trusts. 
The Firm does not consolidate residential mortgage 
securitizations (Firm-sponsored or third-party-sponsored) 
when it is not the servicer (and therefore does not have the 
power to direct the most significant activities of the trust) 
or does not hold a beneficial interest in the trust that could 
potentially be significant to the trust.
Commercial mortgages and other consumer securitizations
CIB originates and securitizes commercial mortgage loans, 
and engages in underwriting and trading activities involving 
the securities issued by securitization trusts. CIB may retain 
unsold senior and/or subordinated interests (including 
amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk 
retention rules) in commercial mortgage securitizations at 
the time of securitization but, generally, the Firm does not 
service commercial loan securitizations. Treasury and CIO 
may choose to invest in these securitizations as well. For 
commercial mortgage securitizations the power to direct 
the significant activities of the VIE generally is held by the 
servicer or investors in a specified class of securities 
(“controlling class”). The Firm generally does not retain an 
interest in the controlling class in its sponsored commercial 
mortgage securitization transactions.
Re-securitizations
The Firm engages in certain re-securitization transactions in 
which debt securities are transferred to a VIE in exchange 
for new beneficial interests. These transfers occur in 
connection with both U.S. GSEs and government agency 
sponsored VIEs, which are backed by residential mortgages. 
The Firm’s consolidation analysis is largely dependent on 
the Firm’s role and interest in the re-securitization trusts.
The following table presents the principal amount of 
securities transferred to re-securitization VIEs.

(in millions)

Most re-securitizations with which the Firm is involved are 
client-driven transactions in which a specific client or group 
of clients is seeking a specific return or risk profile. For 
these transactions, the Firm has concluded that the 
decision-making power of the entity is shared between the 
Firm and its clients, considering the joint effort and 
decisions in establishing the re-securitization trust and its 
assets, as well as the significant economic interest the client 
holds in the re-securitization trust; therefore the Firm does 
not consolidate the re-securitization VIE.
The Firm did not transfer any private label securities to resecuritization VIEs during 2023, 2022 and 2021, and 
retained interests in any such Firm-sponsored VIEs as of 
December 31, 2023 and 2022 were not material.
Additionally, the Firm may invest in beneficial interests of 
third-party-sponsored re-securitizations and generally 
purchases these interests in the secondary market. In these 
circumstances, the Firm does not have the unilateral ability 
to direct the most significant activities of the resecuritization trust, either because it was not involved in 
the initial design of the trust, or the Firm was involved with 
an independent third-party sponsor and demonstrated 
shared power over the creation of the trust; therefore, the 
Firm does not consolidate the re-securitization VIE.

Multi-seller conduits
Multi-seller conduit entities are separate bankruptcy 
remote entities that provide secured financing, 
collateralized by pools of receivables and other financial 
assets, to customers of the Firm. The conduits fund their 
financing facilities through the issuance of highly rated 
commercial paper. The primary source of repayment of the 
commercial paper is the cash flows from the pools of assets. 
In most instances, the assets are structured with dealspecific credit enhancements provided to the conduits by 
the customers (i.e., sellers) or other third parties. Dealspecific credit enhancements are generally structured to 
cover a multiple of historical losses expected on the pool of 
assets, and are typically in the form of overcollateralization 
provided by the seller. The deal-specific credit 
enhancements mitigate the Firm’s potential losses on its 
agreements with the conduits.
To ensure timely repayment of the commercial paper, and 
to provide the conduits with funding to provide financing to 
customers in the event that the conduits do not obtain 
funding in the commercial paper market, each asset pool 
financed by the conduits has a minimum 100% dealspecific liquidity facility associated with it provided by 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. also 
provides the multi-seller conduit vehicles with uncommitted 
program-wide liquidity facilities and program-wide credit 
enhancement in the form of standby letters of credit. The 
amount of program-wide credit enhancement required is 
based upon commercial paper issuance and approximates 
10% of the outstanding balance of commercial paper.
The Firm consolidates its Firm-administered multi-seller 
conduits, as the Firm has both the power to direct the 
significant activities of the conduits and a potentially 
significant economic interest in the conduits. As 
administrative agent and in its role in structuring 
transactions, the Firm makes decisions regarding asset 
types and credit quality, and manages the commercial 
paper funding needs of the conduits. The Firm’s interests 
that could potentially be significant to the VIEs include the 
fees received as administrative agent and liquidity and 
program-wide credit enhancement provider, as well as the 
potential exposure created by the liquidity and credit 
enhancement facilities provided to the conduits.
In the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes 
markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by the 
Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $9.8 
billion and $13.8 billion of the commercial paper issued by 
the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at 
December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which have 
been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm’s investments 
reflect the Firm’s funding needs and capacity and were not 
driven by market illiquidity. Other than the amounts 
required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules, 
the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase 
the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered 
multi-seller conduits.
Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and 
credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been 
eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firmadministered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related 
commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered 
multi-seller conduits. The unfunded commitments were 
$10.8 billion and $10.6 billion at December 31, 2023 and 
2022, respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet 
lending-related commitments in other unfunded 
commitments to extend credit. Refer to Note 28 for more 
information on off-balance sheet lending-related 
commitments. 
Municipal bond vehicles
Municipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”) 
trusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond 
investments at short-term rates. In a typical TOB 
transaction, the trust purchases highly rated municipal 
bond(s) of a single issuer and funds the purchase by issuing 
two types of securities: (1) puttable floating-rate 
certificates (“floaters”) and (2) inverse floating-rate 
residual interests (“residuals”). The floaters are typically 
purchased by money market funds or other short-term 
investors and may be tendered, with requisite notice, to the 
TOB trust. The residuals are retained by the investor 
seeking to finance its municipal bond investment. TOB 
transactions where the residual is held by a third-party 
investor are typically known as customer TOB trusts, and 
non-customer TOB trusts are transactions where the 
Residual is retained by the Firm. Customer TOB trusts are 
sponsored by a third party. The Firm serves as sponsor for 
all non-customer TOB transactions. The Firm may provide 
various services to a TOB trust, including remarketing 
agent, liquidity or tender option provider, and/or sponsor.
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC may serve as a remarketing 
agent on the floaters for TOB trusts. The remarketing agent 
is responsible for establishing the periodic variable rate on 
the floaters, conducting the initial placement and 
remarketing tendered floaters. The remarketing agent may, 
but is not obligated to, make markets in floaters. Floaters 
held by the Firm were not material during 2023 and 2022.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or J.P. Morgan Securities LLC 
often serves as the sole liquidity or tender option provider 
for the TOB trusts. The liquidity provider’s obligation to 
perform is conditional and is limited by certain events 
Notes to consolidated financial statements

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K
Nonconsolidated 
re-securitization VIEs 2022 

(“Termination Events”), which include bankruptcy or failure 
to pay by the municipal bond issuer or credit enhancement 
provider, an event of taxability on the municipal bonds or 
the immediate downgrade of the municipal bond to below 
investment grade. In addition, the liquidity provider’s 
exposure is typically further limited by the high credit 
quality of the underlying municipal bonds, the excess 
collateralization in the vehicle, or, in certain transactions, 
the reimbursement agreements with the Residual holders.
Holders of the floaters may “put,” or tender, their floaters 
to the TOB trust. If the remarketing agent cannot 
successfully remarket the floaters to another investor, the 
liquidity provider either provides a loan to the TOB trust for 
the TOB trust’s purchase of the floaters, or it directly 
purchases the tendered floaters. 
TOB trusts are considered to be variable interest entities. 
The Firm consolidates non-customer TOB trusts because as 
the Residual holder, the Firm has the right to make 
decisions that significantly impact the economic 
performance of the municipal bond vehicle, and it has the 
right to receive benefits and bear losses that could 
potentially be significant to the municipal bond vehicle.

VIEs sponsored by third parties 
The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by 
other parties. These include, for example, acting as a 
derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, 
underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee 
or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’slength, and individual credit decisions are based on the 
analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the 
quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not 
have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most 
significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a 
variable interest that could potentially be significant, the 
Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records 
and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance 
sheets in the same manner it would record and report 
positions in respect of any other third-party transaction. 
Tax credit vehicles 
The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit 
vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities 
that own and operate affordable housing, energy, and other 
projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A 
third party is typically the general partner or managing 
member and has control over the significant activities of the 
tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not 
consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in 
these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return 
primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the 
projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by 
equity investments and funding commitments, was $35.1 
billion and $30.2 billion, of which $14.7 billion and $10.6 
billion was unfunded at December 31, 2023 and 2022, 
respectively. The Firm assesses each project and to reduce 
the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital 
investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer 
to Note 25 for further information on affordable housing 
tax credits and Note 28 for more information on off-balance 
sheet lending-related commitments.
Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) 
The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB 
trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender 
option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the 
Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a 
reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In 
those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the 
Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for 
any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to protect 
Residual holders from potential losses on any of the 
underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate 
customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the 
power to make decisions that significantly impact the 
economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle.
The Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to 
customer TOB trusts at December 31, 2023 and 2022, was 
$5.1 billion and $5.8 billion, respectively. The fair value of 
assets held by such VIEs at December 31, 2023 and 2022 
was $7.3 billion and $8.2 billion respectively.
Loan securitizations
The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, 
including residential mortgages, credit card receivables, 
commercial mortgages and other consumer loans. The 
purposes of these securitization transactions were to satisfy 
investor demand and to generate liquidity for the Firm.
For loan securitizations in which the Firm is not required to 
consolidate the trust, the Firm records the transfer of the 
loan receivable to the trust as a sale when all of the 
following accounting criteria for a sale are met: (1) the 
transferred financial assets are legally isolated from the 
Firm’s creditors; (2) the transferee or beneficial interest 
holder can pledge or exchange the transferred financial 
assets; and (3) the Firm does not maintain effective control 
over the transferred financial assets (e.g., the Firm cannot 
repurchase the transferred assets before their maturity and 
it does not have the ability to unilaterally cause the holder 
to return the transferred assets).
For loan securitizations accounted for as a sale, the Firm 
recognizes a gain or loss based on the difference between 
the value of proceeds received (including cash, beneficial 
interests, or servicing assets received) and the carrying 
value of the assets sold. Gains and losses on securitizations 
are reported in noninterest revenue.

In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization 
activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of 
business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans 
and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis, 
predominantly to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs 
are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the 
U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., 
credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans 
into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae 
guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed 
by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not 
consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these 
transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a 
limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share 
a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans 
with the purchaser. Refer to Note 28 for additional 
information about the Firm’s loan sales- and securitizationrelated indemnifications and Note 15 for additional 
information about the impact of the Firm’s sale of certain

Options to repurchase delinquent loans
In addition to the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain 
loans due to material breaches of representations and 
warranties as discussed in Note 28, the Firm also has the 
option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for 
Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government 
agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm typically 
elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan 
pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the 
foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable 
requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or 
guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase option becomes 
exercisable, such loans must be reported on the 
Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding 
liability. Refer to Note 12 for additional information.

Note 15 – Goodwill, mortgage servicing rights, and other intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill is recorded upon completion of a business 
combination as the difference between the purchase price 
and the fair value of the net assets acquired, and can be 
adjusted up to one year from the acquisition date as 
additional information pertaining to facts and 
circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date is 
obtained about the fair value of assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment 
during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often 
if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the 
business climate, indicate that there may be an impairment.
The goodwill associated with each business combination is 
allocated to the related reporting units, which are generally 
determined based on how the Firm’s businesses are 
managed and how they are reviewed. The following table 
presents goodwill attributed to the reportable business 
segments and Corporate.

Goodwill impairment testing
The Firm’s goodwill was not impaired at December 31, 
2023, 2022 and 2021.
The goodwill impairment test is generally performed by 
comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit with 
its carrying value. If the fair value is in excess of the 
carrying value, then the reporting unit’s goodwill is 
considered not to be impaired. If the fair value is less than 
the carrying value, then an impairment is recognized for the 
amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying value 
exceeds its fair value, up to the amount of goodwill 
allocated to that reporting unit. 
The Firm uses the reporting units’ allocated capital plus 
goodwill and other intangible assets as a proxy for the 
carrying values of equity for the reporting units in the 
goodwill impairment testing. Reporting unit equity is 
determined on a similar basis as the allocation of capital to 
the LOBs which takes into consideration a variety of factors 
including capital levels of similarly rated peers and 
applicable regulatory capital requirements. LOB’s allocated 
capital levels are incorporated into the Firm’s annual 
budget process, which is reviewed by the Firm’s Board of 
Directors and Operating Committee. Allocated capital is 
further reviewed at least annually and updated as needed.
The primary method the Firm uses to estimate the fair value 
of its reporting units is the income approach. This approach 
projects cash flows for the forecast period and uses the 
perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal values. 
These cash flows and terminal values, which are based on 
the reporting units’ annual budgets and forecasts are then 
discounted using an appropriate discount rate. The discount 
rate used for each reporting unit represents an estimate of 
the cost of equity for that reporting unit and is determined 
considering the Firm’s overall estimated cost of equity 
(estimated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model), as 
adjusted for the risk characteristics specific to each 
reporting unit (for example, for higher levels of risk or 
uncertainty associated with the business or management’s 
forecasts and assumptions). To assess the reasonableness 
of the discount rates used for each reporting unit, 
management compares the discount rate to the estimated 
cost of equity for publicly traded institutions with similar 
businesses and risk characteristics. In addition, the 
weighted average cost of equity (aggregating the various 
reporting units) is compared with the Firm’s overall 
estimated cost of equity for reasonableness. The valuations 
derived from the discounted cash flow analysis are then 
compared with market-based trading and transaction 
multiples for relevant competitors. Trading and transaction 
comparables are used as general indicators to assess the 
overall reasonableness of the estimated fair values, 
although precise conclusions generally cannot be drawn 
due to the differences that naturally exist between the 
Firm’s businesses and competitor institutions. 
The Firm also takes into consideration a comparison 
between the aggregate fair values of the Firm’s reporting 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

units and JPMorgan Chase’s market capitalization. In 
evaluating this comparison, the Firm considers several 
factors, including (i) a control premium that would exist in a 
market transaction, (ii) factors related to the level of 
execution risk that would exist at the Firmwide level that do 
not exist at the reporting unit level and (iii) short-term 
market volatility and other factors that do not directly 
affect the value of individual reporting units.
Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases 
in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as well as 
deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse 
regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the 
estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated 
fair values of the Firm’s reporting units to decline in the 
future, which could result in a material impairment loss to 
earnings in a future period related to some portion of the 
associated goodwill. 
Mortgage servicing rights
MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows 
for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value 
considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary 
revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and 
generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are 
received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against 
contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are 
either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale 
or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained.
As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to account 
for its MSRs at fair value. The Firm treats its MSRs as a 
single class of servicing assets based on the availability of 
market inputs used to measure the fair value of its MSR 
asset and its treatment of MSRs as one aggregate pool for 
risk management purposes. The Firm estimates the fair 
value of MSRs using an option-adjusted spread (“OAS”) 
model, which projects MSR cash flows over multiple interest 
rate scenarios in conjunction with the Firm’s prepayment 
model, and then discounts these cash flows at risk-adjusted 
rates. The model considers portfolio characteristics, 
contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment 
assumptions, delinquency rates, costs to service, late 
charges and other ancillary revenue, and other economic 
factors. The Firm compares fair value estimates and 
assumptions to observable market data where available, 
and also considers recent market activity and actual 
portfolio experience. 
Notes to consolidated financial statements

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

The fair value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in interest 
rates, including their effect on prepayment speeds. MSRs 
typically decrease in value when interest rates decline 
because declining interest rates tend to increase 
prepayments and therefore reduce the expected life of the 
net servicing cash flows that comprise the MSR asset. 
Conversely, securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities), 
and certain derivatives (e.g., those for which the Firm 
receives fixed-rate interest payments) increase in value 
when interest rates decline. JPMorgan Chase uses 
combinations of derivatives and securities to manage the 
risk of changes in the fair value of MSRs. The intent is to 
offset any interest-rate related changes in the fair value of 
MSRs with changes in the fair value of the related risk 
management instruments.
The following table summarizes MSR activity for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.

short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the trust or the underlying loans. The Firm’s credit risk associated with these servicer 
advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right 
to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if 
they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements.

Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions 
generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the 
relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change 
in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be 
linear. In the following table, the effect that a change in a 
particular assumption may have on the fair value is 
calculated without changing any other assumption. In 
reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in 
another, which would either magnify or counteract the 
impact of the initial change.

Other intangible assets
The Firm’s finite-lived and indefinite-lived other intangible 
assets are initially recorded at their fair value primarily 
upon completion of a business combination. Subsequently, 
the Firm’s finite-lived intangible assets, including core 
deposit intangibles, customer relationship intangibles, and 
certain other intangible assets, are amortized over their 
useful lives, estimated based on the expected future 
economic benefits to the Firm of the intangible asset. The 
Firm’s intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as asset 
management contracts, are not subject to amortization and 
are assessed periodically for impairment.
As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the gross carrying 
values of other intangible assets were $4.2 billion and $1.9 
billion, respectively, and the accumulated amortization was 
$994 million and $679 million, respectively. 
As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the net carrying 
values consist of finite-lived intangible assets of $2.0 billion 
and $707 million, respectively, as well as indefinite-lived 
intangible assets, which are not subject to amortization, of 
$1.2 billion and $517 million, respectively.
As of December 31, 2023, other intangible assets reflected 
core deposit and certain wealth management customer 
relationship intangibles related to the First Republic 
acquisition, and asset management contracts related to the 
Firm’s acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in CIFM. 
Refer to Note 34 for additional information on the First 
Republic acquisition.
As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, amortization expense 
was $315 million and $145 million, respectively. 
The following table presents estimated future amortization 
expense.

Impairment testing
The Firm’s finite-lived and indefinite-lived other intangible 
assets are assessed for impairment annually or more often 
if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset 
might be impaired. Once the Firm determines that an 
impairment exists for an intangible asset, the impairment is 
recognized in other expense.

and furniture and equipment.
JPMorgan Chase computes depreciation using the straightline method over the estimated useful life for buildings and 
furniture and equipment. The Firm depreciates leasehold 
improvements over the lesser of the remainder of the lease 
term or the estimated useful life. The Firm also capitalizes 
certain costs associated with the acquisition or 
development of internal-use software. Once the software is 
ready for its intended use, these costs are amortized on a 
straight-line basis over the software’s expected useful life. 
The estimated useful lives range from 10 to 50 years for 
buildings and leasehold improvements, and 3 to 10 years 
for internal-use software and furniture and equipment.
Impairment is assessed when events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset 
may not be fully recoverable.

Note 18 - Leases
Firm as lessee
At December 31, 2023, JPMorgan Chase and its 
subsidiaries were obligated under a number of 
noncancellable leases, predominantly operating leases for 
premises and equipment used primarily for business 
purposes. These leases generally have terms of 20 years or 
less, determined based on the contractual maturity of the 
lease, and include periods covered by options to extend or 
terminate the lease when the Firm is reasonably certain 
that it will exercise those options. All leases with lease 
terms greater than twelve months are reported as a lease 
liability with a corresponding right-of-use (“ROU”) asset. 
None of these lease agreements impose restrictions on the 
Firm’s ability to pay dividends, engage in debt or equity 
financing transactions or enter into further lease 
agreements. Certain of these leases contain escalation 
clauses that will increase rental payments based on 
maintenance, utility and tax increases, which are non-lease 
components. The Firm elected not to separate lease and 
non-lease components of a contract for its real estate 
leases. As such, real estate lease payments represent 
payments on both lease and non-lease components. 
Operating lease liabilities and ROU assets are recognized at 
the lease commencement date based on the present value 
of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. 
The future lease payments are discounted at a rate that 
estimates the Firm’s collateralized borrowing rate for 
financing instruments of a similar term and are included in 
accounts payable and other liabilities. The operating lease 
ROU assets, predominantly included in premises and 
equipment, also include any lease prepayments made, plus 
initial direct costs incurred, less any lease incentives 
received. Rental expense associated with operating leases is 
recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and 
generally included in occupancy expense in the 
Consolidated statements of income.

Firm as lessor
The Firm provides auto and equipment lease financing to its 
customers through lease arrangements with lease terms 
that may contain renewal, termination and/or purchase 
options. The Firm’s lease financings are predominantly auto 
operating leases. These assets subject to operating leases 
are recognized in other assets on the Firm’s Consolidated 
balance sheets and are depreciated on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term to reduce the asset to its estimated 
residual value. Depreciation expense is included in 
technology, communications and equipment expense in the 
Consolidated statements of income. The Firm’s lease 
income is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term and is included in other income in the 
Consolidated statements of income. 
On a periodic basis, the Firm assesses leased assets for 
impairment, and if the carrying amount of the leased asset 
exceeds the undiscounted cash flows from the lease 
payments and the estimated residual value upon disposition 
of the leased asset, an impairment is recognized. 
The risk of loss on auto and equipment leased assets 
relating to the residual value of the leased assets is 
monitored through projections of the asset residual values 
at lease origination and periodic review of residual values, 
and is mitigated through arrangements with certain 
manufacturers or lessees.

by cardholders. The liability is accrued as the cardholder 
earns the benefit and is reduced when the cardholder 
redeems points. The redemption rate and cost per point 
assumptions are key assumptions to estimate the liability 
and the current period impact is recognized in Card Income.

2023 Total 

The weighted-average contractual interest rates for total 
long-term debt excluding structured notes accounted for at 
fair value were 3.65% and 3.26% as of December 31, 
2023 and 2022, respectively. In order to modify exposure 
to interest rate and currency exchange rate movements, 
JPMorgan Chase utilizes derivative instruments, primarily 
interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps, in 
conjunction with some of its debt issuances. The use of 
these instruments modifies the Firm’s interest expense on 
the associated debt. The modified weighted-average 
interest rates for total long-term debt, including the effects 
of related derivative instruments, were 5.20% and 4.89% 
as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. has guaranteed certain long-term 
debt of its subsidiaries, including structured notes. These 
guarantees rank pari passu with the Firm’s other unsecured 
and unsubordinated indebtedness. The amount of such 
guaranteed long-term debt and structured notes was $41.1 
billion and $28.2 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, 
respectively. 
The Firm’s unsecured debt does not contain requirements 
that would call for an acceleration of payments, maturities 
or changes in the structure of the existing debt, provide any 
limitations on future borrowings or require additional 
collateral, based on unfavorable changes in the Firm’s 
credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings or stock price.

Note 21 – Preferred stock
At December 31, 2023 and 2022, JPMorgan Chase was authorized to issue 200 million shares of preferred stock, in one or 
more series, with a par value of $1 per share. In the event of a liquidation or dissolution of the Firm, JPMorgan Chase’s 
preferred stock then outstanding takes precedence over the Firm’s common stock with respect to the payment of dividends 
and the distribution of assets.
The following is a summary of JPMorgan Chase’s non-cumulative preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and 
2022, and the quarterly dividend declarations for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.

program previously approved by the Board of Directors, 
which was announced on April 13, 2022.

Act of 2022, a 1% excise tax was imposed on net share repurchases 
effective January 1, 2023.
(b) In the second half of 2022, the Firm temporarily suspended share 
repurchases, which it resumed under its current common share 
repurchase program in the first quarter of 2023.
(c) As directed by the Federal Reserve, total net repurchases and common 
stock dividends in the first and second quarter of 2021 were restricted 
and could not exceed the average of the Firm’s net income for the four 
preceding calendar quarters. Effective July 1, 2021, the Firm became 
subject to the normal capital distribution restrictions provided under 
the regulatory capital framework.
The Board of Directors’ authorization to repurchase 
common shares is utilized at management’s discretion, and 
the timing of purchases and the exact amount of common 
shares that may be repurchased is subject to various 
factors, including market conditions; legal and regulatory 
considerations affecting the amount and timing of 
repurchase activity; the Firm’s capital position (taking into 
account goodwill and intangibles); internal capital 
generation; current and proposed future capital 
requirements; and alternative investment opportunities. 
The $30 billion common share repurchase program 
approved by the Board does not establish specific price 
targets or timetables. The repurchase program may be 
suspended by management at any time; and may be 
executed through open market purchases or privately 
negotiated transactions, or utilizing Rule 10b5-1 plans, 
which are written trading plans that the Firm may enter into 
from time to time under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 and which allow the Firm to 
repurchase its common shares during periods when it may 
otherwise not be repurchasing common shares — for 
example, during internal trading blackout periods.
As of December 31, 2023, approximately 61.6 million 
shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under 
various employee incentive, compensation, option and 
stock purchase plans, and directors’ compensation plans.
Notes to consolidated financial statements

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

Note 23 – Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated using the 
two-class method. Under the two-class method, all earnings 
(distributed and undistributed) are allocated to common 
stock and participating securities. JPMorgan Chase grants 
RSUs under its share-based compensation programs, 
predominantly all of which entitle recipients to receive 
nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a 
basis equivalent to dividends paid to holders of the Firm’s 
common stock. These unvested RSUs meet the definition of 
participating securities based on their respective rights to 
receive nonforfeitable dividends, and they are treated as a 
separate class of securities in computing basic EPS. 
Participating securities are not included as incremental 
shares in computing diluted EPS; refer to Note 9 for 
additional information.
Diluted EPS incorporates the potential impact of 
contingently issuable shares, including awards which 
require future service as a condition of delivery of the 
underlying common stock. Diluted EPS is calculated under 
both the two-class and treasury stock methods, and the 
more dilutive amount is reported. For each of the periods 
presented in the table below, diluted EPS calculated under 
the two-class method was more dilutive.
The following table presents the calculation of net income 
applicable to common stockholders and basic and diluted 
EPS for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 
2021.

Note 25 – Income taxes
JPMorgan Chase and its eligible subsidiaries file a 
consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. JPMorgan 
Chase uses the asset and liability method to provide for 
income taxes on all transactions recorded in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements. This method requires 
that income taxes reflect the expected future tax 
consequences of temporary differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book and tax 
purposes. Accordingly, a deferred tax asset or liability for 
each temporary difference is determined based on the tax 
rates that the Firm expects to be in effect when the 
underlying items of income and expense are realized. 

current and deferred portions of that expense. A valuation 
allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to 
the amount the Firm expects to realize. 
Due to the inherent complexities arising from the nature of 
the Firm’s businesses, and from conducting business and 
being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions, 
significant judgments and estimates are required to be 
made. Agreement of tax liabilities between JPMorgan Chase 
and the many tax jurisdictions in which the Firm files tax 
returns may not be finalized for several years. Thus, the 
Firm’s final tax-related assets and liabilities may ultimately 
be different from those currently reported.

Affordable housing tax credits
The Firm recognized $2.0 billion of tax credits and other tax 
benefits associated with investments in affordable housing 
projects within income tax expense for the year ended 
2023, and $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion for the years ended 
2022 and 2021, respectively. The amount of amortization 
of such investments reported in income tax expense was 
$1.6 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. The 
carrying value of these investments, which are reported in 
other assets on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets, was 
$14.6 billion and $12.1 billion at December 31, 2023 and 
2022, respectively. The amount of commitments related to 
these investments, which are reported in accounts payable 
and other liabilities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance 
sheets, was $6.8 billion and $5.4 billion at December 31, 
2023 and 2022, respectively. 
Deferred taxes 
Deferred income tax expense/(benefit) reflects the 
differences between assets and liabilities measured for 
financial reporting purposes versus income tax return 
purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in 
management’s judgment, their realizability is determined to 
be more likely than not. If a deferred tax asset is 
determined to be unrealizable, a valuation allowance is 
established. The significant components of deferred tax 
assets and liabilities are reflected in the following table, the 
net deferred tax assets are reflected in other assets on the 
Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.

an impact to the gross deferred tax assets and liabilities.
JPMorgan Chase has recorded deferred tax assets of $290 
million at December 31, 2023 in connection with tax 
attribute carryforwards. State and local capital loss 
carryforwards were $1.2 billion, U.S. federal NOL 
carryforwards were $586 million, non-U.S. NOL 
carryforwards were $570 million, and other U.S. federal tax 
attributes were $118 million. If not utilized, a portion of the 
U.S. federal NOL carryforwards and other U.S. federal tax 
attributes will expire between 2026 and 2037 whereas 
others have an unlimited carryforward period. Similarly, 
certain non-U.S. NOL carryforwards will expire between 
2026 and 2040 whereas others have an unlimited 
carryforward period. The state and local capital loss 
carryforwards will expire in 2026 and 2027. 
The valuation allowance at December 31, 2023, was due to 
the state and local capital loss carryforwards and certain 
non-U.S. deferred tax assets, including NOL carryforwards.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

Unrecognized tax benefits
At December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, JPMorgan Chase’s 
unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest 
expense and penalties, were $5.4 billion, $5.0 billion and 
$4.6 billion, respectively, of which $3.9 billion, $3.8 billion 
and $3.4 billion, respectively, if recognized, would reduce 
the annual effective tax rate. Included in the amount of 
unrecognized tax benefits are certain items that would not 
affect the effective tax rate if they were recognized in the 
Consolidated statements of income. These unrecognized 
items include the tax effect of certain temporary 
differences, the portion of gross state and local 
unrecognized tax benefits that would be offset by the 
benefit from associated U.S. federal income tax deductions, 
and the portion of gross non-U.S. unrecognized tax benefits 
that would have offsets in other jurisdictions. JPMorgan 
Chase evaluates the need for changes in unrecognized tax 
benefits based on its anticipated tax return filing positions 
as part of its U.S. federal and state and local tax returns. In 
addition, the Firm is presently under audit by a number of 
taxing authorities, most notably by the Internal Revenue 
Service, as summarized in the Tax examination status table 
below. The evaluation of unrecognized tax benefits as well 
as the potential for audit settlements make it reasonably 
possible that over the next 12 months the gross balance of 
unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease by as 
much as approximately $1.1 billion. The change in the 
unrecognized tax benefit would result in a payment or 
income statement recognition. 
The following table presents a reconciliation of the 
beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits.

At December 31, 2023 and 2022, in addition to the liability 
for unrecognized tax benefits, the Firm had accrued $1.6 
billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, for income tax-related 
interest and penalties.

JPMorgan Chase is continually under examination by the 
Internal Revenue Service, by taxing authorities throughout 
the world, and by many state and local jurisdictions

Note 26 – Restricted cash, other restricted 
assets and intercompany funds transfers 
Restricted cash and other restricted assets 
Certain of the Firm’s cash and other assets are restricted as 
to withdrawal or usage. These restrictions are imposed by 
various regulatory authorities based on the particular 
activities of the Firm’s subsidiaries. 
The business of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to 
examination and regulation by the OCC. The Bank is a 
member of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, and its 
deposits in the U.S. are insured by the FDIC, subject to 
applicable limits. 
The Firm is required to maintain cash reserves at certain 
non-US central banks. 
The Firm is also subject to rules and regulations established 
by other U.S. and non U.S. regulators. As part of its 
compliance with the respective regulatory requirements, 
the Firm’s broker-dealer activities are subject to certain 
restrictions on cash and other assets. 
The following table presents the components of the Firm’s 
restricted cash:

Consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, 
respectively.
Also, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Firm had the 
following other restricted assets: 
• Cash and securities pledged with clearing organizations 
for the benefit of customers of $40.5 billion and $42.4 
billion, respectively. 
• Securities with a fair value of $20.5 billion and $31.7 
billion, respectively, were also restricted in relation to 
customer activity.
Intercompany funds transfers 
Restrictions imposed by U.S. federal law prohibit JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A., and its subsidiaries, from lending to 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“Parent Company”) and certain of 
its affiliates unless the loans are secured in specified 
amounts. Such secured loans provided by any banking 
subsidiary to the Parent Company or to any particular 
affiliate, together with certain other transactions with such 
affiliate (collectively referred to as “covered transactions”), 
must be made on terms and conditions that are consistent 
with safe and sound banking practices. In addition, unless 
collateralized with cash or US Government debt obligations, 
covered transactions are generally limited to 10% of the 
banking subsidiary’s total capital, as determined by the riskbased capital guidelines; the aggregate amount of covered 
transactions between any banking subsidiary and all of its 
affiliates is limited to 20% of the banking subsidiary’s total 
capital.
The Parent Company’s two principal subsidiaries are 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Holdings 
LLC, an intermediate holding company (the “IHC”). The IHC 
generally holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries 
other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. 
The IHC also owns other assets and provides intercompany 
loans to the Parent Company. The Parent Company is 
obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net 
proceeds received from securities issuances (including 
issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of 
preferred and common stock).
The principal sources of income and funding for the Parent 
Company are dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 
and dividends and extensions of credit from the IHC. In 
addition to dividend restrictions set forth in statutes and 
regulations, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have 
authority under the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act to 
prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking 
organizations they supervise, including the Parent Company 
and its subsidiaries that are banks or bank holding 
companies, if, in the banking regulator’s opinion, payment 
of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound 
practice in light of the financial condition of the banking 
organization. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or 
extending credit to the Parent Company if certain capital or 
liquidity “thresholds” are breached or if limits are otherwise 
imposed by the Parent Company’s management or Board of 
Directors.
At January 1, 2024, the Parent Company’s banking 
subsidiaries could pay, in the aggregate, approximately $20 
billion in dividends to their respective bank holding 
companies without the prior approval of their relevant 
banking regulators. The capacity to pay dividends in 2024 
will be supplemented by the banking subsidiaries’ earnings 
during the year.
Notes to consolidated financial statements

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

Note 27 – Regulatory capital 
The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, 
including well-capitalized standards, for the Firm as a 
consolidated financial holding company. The OCC 
establishes similar minimum capital requirements and 
standards for the Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. 
The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital 
ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and 
internationally active U.S. bank holding companies and 
banks, including the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 
Two comprehensive approaches are prescribed for 
calculating RWA: a standardized approach (“Basel III 
Standardized”), and an advanced approach (“Basel III 
Advanced”). For each of the risk-based capital ratios, the 
capital adequacy of the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
N.A. is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or 
Advanced approaches compared to their respective 
regulatory capital ratio requirements. 
The three components of regulatory capital under the Basel 
III rules are as illustrated below:
Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based guidelines 
of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to 
maintain minimum ratios for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, 
Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR. Failure to meet 
these minimum requirements could cause the Federal 
Reserve to take action. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is also 
subject to these capital requirements established by its 
primary regulators. 
The following table presents the risk-based regulatory 
capital ratio requirements and well-capitalized ratios to 
which the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were subject 
as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.

Firm. The CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratio requirements each 
include a respective minimum requirement plus a GSIB surcharge of 
4.0% as calculated under Method 2; plus a 2.9% SCB for Basel III 
Standardized ratios and a fixed 2.5% capital conservation buffer for 
Basel III Advanced ratios. The countercyclical buffer is currently set to 
0% by the federal banking agencies.
(b) For the period ended December 31, 2022, the CET1, Tier 1, and Total 
capital ratio requirements under Basel III Standardized applicable to 
the Firm were 12.0%, 13.5% and 15.5%, respectively; the Basel III 
Advanced CET1, Tier 1, and Total capital ratio requirements applicable 
to the Firm were 10.5%, 12.0%, and 14.0%, respectively. SCB for 
Basel III Standardized ratio for 2022 was 4.0%.
(c) Represents requirements for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The CET1, 
Tier 1 and Total capital ratio requirements include a fixed capital 
conservation buffer requirement of 2.5% that is applicable to 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is not subject 
to the GSIB surcharge.

CECL Regulatory Capital Transition
Beginning January 1, 2022, the $2.9 billion CECL capital 
benefit, provided by the Federal Reserve in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, is being phased out at 25% per year 
over a three-year period. As of December 31, 2023, the 
Firm’s CET1 capital reflected the remaining $1.4 billion 
benefit associated with the CECL capital transition 
provisions. 
Similarly, as of January 1, 2023, the Firm has phased out 
50% of the other CECL capital transition provisions which 
impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets, total 
leverage exposure and RWA, as applicable. 
The following tables present risk-based capital metrics under both the Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced

Note 28 – Off–balance sheet lending-related 
financial instruments, guarantees, and 
other commitments
JPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial 
instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address 
the financing needs of its customers and clients. The 
contractual amount of these financial instruments 
represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm 
should the customer or client draw upon the commitment 
or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the 
guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently 
fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most 
of these commitments and guarantees have historically 
been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without 
being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total 
contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the 
Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit 
exposure or funding requirements. 
To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and 
certain consumer lending-related commitments, an 
allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments 
is maintained. Refer to Note 13 for further information 
regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related 
commitments.
The following table summarizes the contractual amounts 
and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related 
financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments 
at December 31, 2023 and 2022. The amounts in the table 
below for credit card and home equity lending-related 
commitments represent the total available credit for these 
products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not 
anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these 
products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can 
reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by providing the 
borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, 
without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit 
card lines when the borrower is 60 days or more past due. 
The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are 
significant decreases in the value of the underlying 
property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in 
the creditworthiness of the borrower.

Other unfunded commitments to extend credit 
Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally 
consist of commitments for working capital and general 
corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support 
commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event 
that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new 
investors, as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing 
organizations. The Firm also issues commitments under 
multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in 
several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of 
credit. 
Guarantees 
U.S. GAAP requires that a guarantor recognize, at the 
inception of a guarantee, a liability in an amount equal to 
the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the 
guarantee. U.S. GAAP defines a guarantee as a contract that 
contingently requires the guarantor to pay the guaranteed 
party based upon: (a) changes in an underlying asset, 
liability or equity security of the guaranteed party; or (b) a 
third party’s failure to perform under a specified 
agreement. The Firm considers the following off–balance 
sheet arrangements to be guarantees under U.S. GAAP: 
standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees, 
securities lending indemnifications, certain indemnification 
agreements included within third-party contractual 
arrangements, certain derivative contracts and the 
guarantees under the sponsored member repo program. 
As required by U.S. GAAP, the Firm initially records 
guarantees at the inception date fair value of the noncontingent obligation assumed (e.g., the amount of 
consideration received or the net present value of the 
premium receivable). For these obligations, the Firm 
records this fair value amount in other liabilities with an 
offsetting entry recorded in cash (for premiums received), 
or other assets (for premiums receivable). Any premium 
receivable recorded in other assets is reduced as cash is 
received under the contract, and the fair value of the 
liability recorded at inception is amortized into income as 
lending and deposit-related fees over the life of the 
guarantee contract. The lending-related contingent 
obligation is recognized based on expected credit losses in 
addition to, and separate from, any non-contingent 
obligation.
Non-lending-related contingent obligations are recognized 
when the liability becomes probable and reasonably 
estimable. These obligations are not recognized if the 
estimated amount is less than the carrying amount of any 
non-contingent liability recognized at inception (adjusted 
for any amortization). Examples of non-lending-related 
contingent obligations include indemnifications provided in 
sales agreements, where a portion of the sale proceeds is 
allocated to the guarantee, which adjusts the gain or loss 
that would otherwise result from the transaction. For these 
indemnifications, the initial liability is amortized to income 
as the Firm’s risk is reduced (i.e., over time or when the 
indemnification expires).
The contractual amount and carrying value of guarantees 
and indemnifications are included in the table on page 292.
For additional information on the guarantees, see below. 
Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees 
Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are 
conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to 
guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a 
third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial 
paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, 
trade financings and similar transactions. 
The following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other financial 
guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.

Securities lending indemnifications 
Through the Firm’s securities lending program, 
counterparties’ securities, via custodial and non-custodial 
arrangements, may be lent to third parties. As part of this 
program, the Firm provides an indemnification in the 
lending agreements which protects the lender against the 
failure of the borrower to return the lent securities. To 
minimize its liability under these indemnification 
agreements, the Firm obtains cash or other highly liquid 
collateral with a market value exceeding 100% of the value 
of the securities on loan from the borrower. Collateral is 
marked to market daily to help assure that collateralization 
is adequate. Additional collateral is called from the 
borrower if a shortfall exists, or collateral may be released 
to the borrower in the event of overcollateralization. If a 
borrower defaults, the Firm would use the collateral held to 
purchase replacement securities in the market or to credit 
the lending client or counterparty with the cash equivalent 
thereof. 
The cash collateral held by the Firm may be invested on 
behalf of the client in indemnified resale agreements, 
whereby the Firm indemnifies the client against the loss of 
principal invested. To minimize its liability under these 
agreements, the Firm obtains collateral with a market value 
exceeding 100% of the principal invested.
Derivatives qualifying as guarantees 
The Firm transacts in certain derivative contracts that have 
the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. These 
contracts include written put options that require the Firm 
to purchase assets upon exercise by the option holder at a 
specified price by a specified date in the future. The Firm 
may enter into written put option contracts in order to meet 
client needs, or for other trading purposes. The terms of 
written put options are typically five years or less. 
Derivatives deemed to be guarantees also includes stable 
value contracts, commonly referred to as “stable value 
products”, that require the Firm to make a payment of the 
difference between the market value and the book value of 
a counterparty’s reference portfolio of assets in the event 
that market value is less than book value and certain other 
conditions have been met. Stable value products are 
transacted in order to allow investors to realize investment 
returns with less volatility than an unprotected portfolio. 
These contracts are typically longer-term or may have no 
stated maturity, but allow the Firm to elect to terminate the 
contract under certain conditions. 
The notional value of derivative guarantees generally 
represents the Firm’s maximum exposure. However, 
exposure to certain stable value products is contractually 
limited to a substantially lower percentage of the notional 
amount. 
The fair value of derivative guarantees reflects the 
probability, in the Firm’s view, of whether the Firm will be 
required to perform under the contract. The Firm reduces 
exposures to these contracts by entering into offsetting 
transactions, or by entering into contracts that hedge the 
market risk related to the derivative guarantees. 
The following table summarizes the derivatives qualifying 
as guarantees as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.

In addition to derivative contracts that meet the 
characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser 
and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives 
market. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of credit 
derivatives. 
Unsettled securities financing agreements 
In the normal course of business, the Firm enters into resale 
and securities borrowed agreements. At settlement, these 
commitments result in the Firm advancing cash to and 
receiving securities collateral from the counterparty. The 
Firm also enters into repurchase and securities loaned 
agreements. At settlement, these commitments result in the 
Firm receiving cash from and providing securities collateral 
to the counterparty. Such agreements settle at a future 
date. These agreements generally do not meet the 
definition of a derivative, and therefore, are not recorded 
on the Consolidated balance sheets until settlement date. 
These agreements predominantly have regular-way 
settlement terms. Refer to Note 11 for a further discussion 
of securities financing agreements. 
Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications 
Mortgage repurchase liability 
In connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and 
securitization activities with U.S. GSEs the Firm has made 
representations and warranties that the loans sold meet 
certain requirements, and that may require the Firm to 
repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan 
purchaser if such representations and warranties are 
breached by the Firm. 
Private label securitizations
The liability related to repurchase demands associated with 
private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the 
Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. 
Refer to Note 30 for additional information regarding 
litigation. 
Loans sold with recourse 
The Firm provides servicing for mortgages and certain 
commercial lending products on both a recourse and 
nonrecourse basis. In nonrecourse servicing, the principal 
credit risk to the Firm is the cost of temporary servicing 
advances of funds (i.e., normal servicing advances). In 
recourse servicing, the servicer agrees to share credit risk 
with the owner of the mortgage loans, such as Fannie Mae 
Notes to consolidated financial statements

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

or Freddie Mac or a private investor, insurer or guarantor. 
Losses on recourse servicing predominantly occur when 
foreclosure sales proceeds of the property underlying a 
defaulted loan are less than the sum of the outstanding 
principal balance, plus accrued interest on the loan and the 
cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property. 
The Firm’s securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, 
thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit 
losses to the purchaser of the mortgage-backed securities 
issued by the trust. The unpaid principal balance of loans 
sold with recourse as well as the carrying value of the 
related liability that the Firm has recorded in accounts 
payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance 
sheets, which is representative of the Firm’s view of the 
likelihood it will have to perform under its recourse 
obligations, are disclosed in the table on page 292.
Other off-balance sheet arrangements 
Indemnification agreements – general 
In connection with issuing securities to investors outside the 
U.S., the Firm may agree to pay additional amounts to the 
holders of the securities in the event that, due to a change 
in tax law, certain types of withholding taxes are imposed 
on payments on the securities. The terms of the securities 
may also give the Firm the right to redeem the securities if 
such additional amounts are payable. The Firm may also 
enter into indemnification clauses in connection with the 
licensing of software to clients (“software licensees”) or 
when it sells a business or assets to a third party (“thirdparty purchasers”), pursuant to which it indemnifies 
software licensees for claims of liability or damages that 
may occur subsequent to the licensing of the software, or 
third-party purchasers for losses they may incur due to 
actions taken by the Firm prior to the sale of the business or 
assets. It is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum 
exposure under these indemnification arrangements, since 
this would require an assessment of future changes in tax 
law and future claims that may be made against the Firm 
that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical 
experience, management expects the risk of loss to be 
remote. 
Merchant charge-backs 
Under the rules of payment networks, in its role as a 
merchant acquirer, the Firm’s Merchant Services business 
in CIB Payments, retains a contingent liability for disputed 
processed credit and debit card transactions that result in a 
charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the 
cardholder’s favor, the Firm will (through the cardholder’s 
issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder 
and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If the 
Firm is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, the 
Firm will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded 
to the cardholder. The Firm mitigates this risk by 
withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve 
accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, the Firm 
recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment 
or performance risk related to charge-backs. 
For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, 
the Firm processed an aggregate volume of $2,411.0 
billion, $2,158.4 billion, and $1,886.7 billion, respectively.
Clearing Services – Client Credit Risk 
The Firm provides clearing services for clients by entering 
into securities purchases and sales and derivative contracts 
with CCPs, including ETDs such as futures and options, as 
well as OTC-cleared derivative contracts. As a clearing 
member, the Firm stands behind the performance of its 
clients, collects cash and securities collateral (margin) as 
well as any settlement amounts due from or to clients, and 
remits them to the relevant CCP or client in whole or part. 
There are two types of margin: variation margin is posted 
on a daily basis based on the value of clients’ derivative 
contracts and initial margin is posted at inception of a 
derivative contract, generally on the basis of the potential 
changes in the variation margin requirement for the 
contract. 
As a clearing member, the Firm is exposed to the risk of 
nonperformance by its clients, but is not liable to clients for 
the performance of the CCPs. Where possible, the Firm 
seeks to mitigate its risk to the client through the collection 
of appropriate amounts of margin at inception and 
throughout the life of the transactions. The Firm can also 
cease providing clearing services if clients do not adhere to 
their obligations under the clearing agreement. In the event 
of nonperformance by a client, the Firm would close out the 
client’s positions and access available margin. The CCP 
would utilize any margin it holds to make itself whole, with 
any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by the Firm as 
a clearing member. 
The Firm reflects its exposure to nonperformance risk of the 
client through the recognition of margin receivables from 
clients and margin payables to CCPs; the clients’ underlying 
securities or derivative contracts are not reflected in the 
Firm’s Consolidated Financial Statements. 
It is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum possible 
exposure through its role as a clearing member, as this 
would require an assessment of transactions that clients 
may execute in the future. However, based upon historical 
experience, and the credit risk mitigants available to the 
Firm, management believes it is unlikely that the Firm will 
have to make any material payments under these 
arrangements and the risk of loss is expected to be remote. 
Refer to Note 5 for information on the derivatives that the 
Firm executes for its own account and records in its 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Exchange & Clearing House Memberships 
The Firm is a member of several securities and derivative 
exchanges and clearing houses, both in the U.S. and other 
countries, and it provides clearing services to its clients. 
Membership in some of these organizations requires the 
Firm to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the 
organization as a result of the default of another member. 
Such obligations vary with different organizations. These 
obligations may be limited to the amount (or a multiple of 
the amount) of the Firm’s contribution to the guarantee 
fund maintained by a clearing house or exchange as part of 
the resources available to cover any losses in the event of a 
member default. Alternatively, these obligations may also 
include a pro rata share of the residual losses after applying 
the guarantee fund. Additionally, certain clearing houses 
require the Firm as a member to pay a pro rata share of 
losses that may result from the clearing house’s investment 
of guarantee fund contributions and initial margin, 
unrelated to and independent of the default of another 
member. Generally a payment would only be required 
should such losses exceed the resources of the clearing 
house or exchange that are contractually required to 
absorb the losses in the first instance. In certain cases, it is 
difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum possible exposure 
under these membership agreements, since this would 
require an assessment of future claims that may be made 
against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, 
based on historical experience, management expects the 
risk of loss to the Firm to be remote. Where the Firm’s 
maximum possible exposure can be estimated, the amount 
is disclosed in the table on page 292, in the Exchange & 
clearing house guarantees and commitments line. 
Sponsored member repo program 
The Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible 
overnight and term resale and repurchase agreements 
through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed 
Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf of clients 
that become sponsored members under the FICC’s rules. 
The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full 
payment and performance of its sponsored member clients’ 
respective obligations under the FICC’s rules. The Firm 
minimizes its liability under these guarantees by obtaining a 
security interest in the cash or high-quality securities 
collateral that the clients place with the clearing house; 
therefore, the Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. 
The Firm’s maximum possible exposure, without taking into 
consideration the associated collateral, is included in the 
Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments 
line on page 292. Refer to Note 11 for additional 
information on credit risk mitigation practices on resale 
agreements and the types of collateral pledged under 
repurchase agreements. 
Guarantees of subsidiaries 
In the normal course of business, the Parent Company may 
provide counterparties with guarantees of certain of the 
trading and other obligations of its subsidiaries on a 
contract-by-contract basis, as negotiated with the Firm’s 
counterparties. The obligations of the subsidiaries are 
included on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets or are 
reflected as off-balance sheet commitments; therefore, the 
Parent Company has not recognized a separate liability for 
these guarantees. The Firm believes that the occurrence of 
any event that would trigger payments by the Parent 
Company under these guarantees is remote. 
The Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt 
and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan 
Chase Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned 
finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully 
and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company and 
no other subsidiary of the parent company guarantees 
these securities. These guarantees, which rank pari passu 
with the Firm’s unsecured and unsubordinated 
indebtedness, are not included in the table on page 292 of 
this Note. Refer to Note 20 for additional information.

Note 30 – Litigation
Contingencies 
As of December 31, 2023, the Firm and its subsidiaries and 
affiliates are defendants or respondents in numerous 
evolving legal proceedings, including private proceedings, 
public proceedings, government investigations, regulatory 
enforcement matters, and the matters described below. The 
litigations range from individual actions involving a single 
plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of 
class members. Investigations and regulatory enforcement 
matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by 
both governmental agencies and self-regulatory 
organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages 
of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve 
each of the Firm’s lines of business and several geographies 
and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort 
and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and 
consumer protection claims), some of which present novel 
legal theories.
The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of 
reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves 
established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to 
approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2023. This 
estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses 
was based upon information available as of that date for 
those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an 
estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For 
certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an 
estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate 
of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses 
involves significant judgment, given:
the number, variety and varying stages of the 
proceedings, including the fact that many are in 
preliminary stages, 
the existence in many such proceedings of multiple 
defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability 
(if any) has yet to be determined, 
the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the 
proceedings, including issues regarding class 
certification and the scope of many of the claims, and 
the uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of 
such proceedings, including where the Firm has made 
assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or 
other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of 
adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those 
assumptions prove to be incorrect.
In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be 
a result which the Firm did not take into account in its 
estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of 
that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s 
estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible 
losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may 
vary significantly.
Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal 
proceedings.
1MDB Litigation. J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a 
defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia 
by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (“1MDB”), a Malaysian 
state-owned and controlled investment fund. The claim 
alleges “dishonest assistance” against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) 
SA in relation to payments of $300 million and 
$500 million, from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received 
from 1MDB and paid into an account at J.P. Morgan (Suisse) 
SA held by 1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture 
company between 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings 
(Cayman) Limited. The Firm is challenging the validity of 
service and the Malaysian Court’s jurisdiction to hear the 
claim. In August 2023 the Court denied an application by 
1MDB to discontinue its claim with permission to re-file a 
new claim in the future. An appeals court is scheduled in 
August 2024 to hear separate appeals filed by 1MDB and 
the Firm against that August 2023 decision. In its appeal, 
the Firm seeks to prevent any claim from continuing. 
In addition, in November 2023, the Federal Office of the 
Attorney General (OAG) in Switzerland notified J.P. Morgan 
(Suisse) SA that it is conducting an investigation into 
possible criminal liability in connection with transactions 
arising from J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA’s relationship with the 
1MDB PetroSaudi joint venture and its related persons for 
the period September 2009 through August 2015. The OAG 
investigation is ongoing. 
Amrapali. India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is 
investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in 
connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by 
two offshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase 
entities into residential housing projects developed by the 
Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”) relating to delays in delivering 
or failure to deliver residential units. In August 2021, the 
ED issued an order fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited 
approximately $31.5 million, and the Firm is appealing that 
order. Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India 
issued an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali 
and other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase 
entities and the offshore funds that had invested in the 
projects, violated certain criminal currency control and 
money laundering provisions, and ordered the ED to 
conduct a further inquiry. The Firm is responding to and 
cooperating with the inquiry. 
Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm 
previously reported settlements with certain government 
authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and 
trading activities and controls related to those activities. 
Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded 
guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The 
Department of Labor ("DOL") granted the Firm exemptions 
that permit the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on 
the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under 
Notes to consolidated financial statements

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) 
through the ten-year disqualification period following the 
antitrust plea. The only remaining FX-related governmental 
inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission matter 
which is currently pending before the South Africa 
Competition Tribunal.
With respect to civil litigation matters, in a putative class 
action filed against the Firm and other foreign exchange 
dealers on behalf of certain parties who purchased foreign 
currencies at allegedly inflated rates, the District Court 
denied certification of a class and granted summary 
judgment against the named plaintiffs in March 2023. An 
appeal by those plaintiffs of the District Court's decision is 
pending. In addition, some FX-related individual and 
putative class actions based on similar alleged underlying 
conduct have been filed outside the U.S., including in the 
U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. An 
agreement to resolve one of the U.K. actions was reached in 
December 2022. In July 2023, the U.K. Court of Appeal 
overturned the Competition Appeal Tribunal's earlier denial 
of a request for class certification on an opt-out basis. In 
Israel, a settlement in principle has been reached on the 
putative class action, which remains subject to court 
approval. 
Government Inquiries Related to the Zelle Network. The Firm 
is responding to inquiries from civil government authorities 
regarding the handling of disputes related to transfers of 
funds through the Zelle Network. The Firm is cooperating 
with these inquiries and responding to requests for 
information.
Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail 
associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging 
that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, 
conspired to set the price of credit and debit card 
interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of 
antitrust laws.
In September 2018, the parties settled the class action 
seeking monetary relief, with the defendants collectively 
contributing approximately $6.2 billion. The settlement has 
been approved by the District Court and affirmed on appeal. 
Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the 
settlement, $700 million has been returned to the 
defendants from the settlement escrow. A separate class 
action seeking injunctive relief continues, and in September 
2021, the District Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class 
certification in part, and denied the motion in part.
Of the merchants who opted out of the damages class 
settlement, certain merchants filed individual actions 
raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as 
well as against the Firm and other banks. While some of 
those actions remain pending, the defendants have reached 
settlements with the merchants who opted out representing 
approximately 70% of the combined Mastercard-branded 
and Visa-branded payment card sales volume. 
Jeffrey Epstein Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was 
named as a defendant in lawsuits filed in the United States 
District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging 
that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. knowingly facilitated 
Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking and other unlawful conduct 
by providing banking services to Epstein until 2013. In June 
2023, the Court granted preliminary approval of a 
settlement between the victim class and JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A., pursuant to which JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 
paid $290 million to a fund for Epstein survivors. In 
November 2023, the Court granted final approval of the 
settlement, rejecting objections, including those of certain 
state Attorneys General, regarding the victims’ releases. 
LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and 
Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from 
various governmental agencies and entities around the 
world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s 
(“BBA”) London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for 
various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s 
Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss 
Competition Commission’s investigation relating to 
EURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other bank remain 
subject, continues. The Firm appealed a December 2016 
decision by the European Commission against the Firm and 
other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust 
rules relating to EURIBOR. In December 2023, the European 
General Court annulled the fine imposed by the European 
Commission, but exercised its discretion to re-impose a fine 
in an identical amount. The Firm is considering its options. 
In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along 
with other banks in various individual and putative class 
actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar 
LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the 
period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has 
obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain 
other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation. 
The United States District Court for the Southern District of 
New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims 
related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the 
defendants, including the Firm. In addition, a lawsuit filed 
by a group of individual plaintiffs asserting antitrust claims, 
alleging that the Firm and other defendants were engaged 
in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and 
conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based 
consumer loans and credit cards was dismissed in October 
2023. Plaintiff filed an appeal of the dismissal to the United 
States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in November 
2023. The Firm has resolved all non-U.S. dollar LIBOR 
actions.
Russian Litigation. The Firm is obligated to comply with 
international sanctions laws, which mandate the freezing or 
restriction of certain assets. These laws apply when assets 
associated with individuals, companies, products or services 
are within the scope of the sanctions. The Firm has faced 
actual and threatened litigation in Russia seeking payments 
on transactions that the Firm cannot make, and is 
contractually excused from paying, under relevant 
sanctions laws, with judgment entered against the Firm in 
one claim in February 2024. The Russian court may 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

disregard the parties’ contractual agreement on forum 
selection, and may not recognize foreign sanctions laws as a 
basis for not making payment. The Firm holds assets in 
Russia, which could be seized if the claims are granted and 
enforced.
SEC Inquiries. The Firm is responding to requests from the 
SEC regarding aspects of certain advisory programs within 
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, including aggregation of 
accounts for billing, discounting advisory fees, and selecting 
portfolio managers. Separately, the Firm is responding to 
requests from the SEC in connection with the timing of the 
Firm’s liquidation of shares distributed in-kind to certain 
investment vehicles that invest in third-party managed 
private funds. The Firm is cooperating with the SEC in 
regard to both inquires.
Securities Lending Antitrust Litigation. JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, 
Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are 
named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the 
United States District Court for the Southern District of New 
York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust 
law and New York State common law in connection with an 
alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous 
exchange trading for securities lending transactions. The 
settlement of this action by the parties has been 
preliminarily approved, and is subject to final court 
approval.
Shareholder Litigation. Several shareholder putative class 
actions, as well as shareholder derivative actions purporting 
to act on behalf of the Firm, have been filed against the 
Firm, its Board of Directors and certain of its current and 
former officers. 
Certain of these shareholder suits relate to historical 
trading practices by former employees in the precious 
metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct 
which were the subject of the Firm’s resolutions with the 
DOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020, and fiduciary 
activities that were separately the subject of a resolution 
between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in 
November 2020. One of these shareholder derivative suits 
was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in 
May 2022, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust 
enrichment claims relating to the historical trading 
practices and related conduct and fiduciary activities which 
were the subject of the resolutions described above. In 
December 2022, the court granted defendants’ motion to 
dismiss this action in full, and in July 2023, the plaintiff 
filed an appeal, which remains pending. A second 
shareholder derivative action was filed in the United States 
District Court for the Eastern District of New York in 
December 2022 relating to the historical trading practices 
and related conduct, which asserts breach of fiduciary duty 
and contribution claims and alleges that the shareholder is 
excused from making a demand to commence litigation 
because such a demand would have been futile. Defendants 
have moved to dismiss the complaint. In addition, a 
consolidated putative class action is pending in the United 
States District Court for the Eastern District of New York on 
behalf of shareholders who acquired shares of JPMorgan 
Chase common stock during the putative class period, 
alleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm were materially 
false or misleading because they did not disclose certain 
information relating to the historical trading practices and 
conduct. In December 2023, the court granted Defendants’ 
motion to dismiss the amended complaint.
A shareholder derivative suit was filed in May 2023 in the 
United States District Court for the Southern District of New 
York against various officers and directors of the Firm 
asserting breaches of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment 
based upon allegations that the defendants caused the Firm 
to retain Jeffrey Epstein as a client of the bank after 
defendants knew, or should have known, that Epstein was 
using the Firm’s financial services to facilitate his alleged 
sex trafficking activities. In December 2023, the Court 
dismissed the derivative action.
A separate shareholder derivative suit was filed in March 
2022 in the United States District Court for the Eastern 
District of New York asserting breaches of fiduciary duty 
and violations of federal securities laws based on the 
alleged failure of the Board of Directors to exercise 
adequate oversight over the Firm’s compliance with records 
preservation requirements which were the subject of 
resolutions between certain of the Firm’s subsidiaries and 
the SEC and the CFTC. Defendants’ motion to dismiss the 
amended complaint is pending.
Trading Venues Investigations. The Firm has been 
responding to government inquiries regarding its processes 
to inventory trading venues and confirm the completeness 
of certain data fed to trade surveillance platforms. The Firm 
self-identified that certain trading and order data through 
the CIB was not feeding into its trade surveillance 
platforms. The Firm has completed enhancements to the 
CIB’s venue inventory and data completeness controls, and 
other remediation is underway. The Firm has also 
performed a review of the data not originally surveilled, 
which is nearly complete, and has not identified any 
employee misconduct, harm to clients or the market. While 
the identified gaps represent a fraction of the overall 
activity across the CIB, the data gap on one venue, which 
largely consisted of sponsored client access activity, was 
significant. The Firm is dedicated to maintaining rigorous 
controls and continuously enhancing the reliability of its 
trade infrastructure. The Firm expects to enter into 
resolutions with two U.S. regulators that will require the 
Firm to, among other things, complete its remediation, 
engage an independent consultant, and pay aggregate civil 
penalties of approximately $350 million. The Firm is also in 
advanced negotiations with a third U.S. regulator, but there 
is no assurance that such discussions will result in a 
resolution. The Firm does not expect any disruption of 
service to clients as a result of these resolutions.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed 
above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as 
defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial 
number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has 
meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its 
currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to 
defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may 
be initiated from time to time in the future.
The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its 
currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with 
the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm 
accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable 
that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of 
the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its 
outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its 
litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, 
upward or downward, as appropriate, based on 
management’s best judgment after consultation with 
counsel. The Firm’s legal expense was $1.4 billion, $266 
million and $426 million for the years ended December 31, 
2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. There is no assurance 
that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be 
adjusted in the future. 
In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome 
of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek 
very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters 
present novel legal theories, involve a large number of 
parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot 
state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of 
the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate 
resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or 
consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase 
believes, based upon its current knowledge and after 
consultation with counsel, consideration of the material 
legal proceedings described above and after taking into 
account its current litigation reserves and its estimated 
aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal 
proceedings currently pending against it should not have a 
material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial 
condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the 
uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no 
assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will 
not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently 
accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational 
consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular 
matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating 
results for a particular period, depending on, among other 
factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level 
of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period.

The following table presents income statement and balance 
sheet-related information for JPMorgan Chase by major 
international geographic area. The Firm defines 
international activities for purposes of this footnote 
presentation as business transactions that involve clients 
residing outside of the U.S., and the information presented 
below is based predominantly on the domicile of the client, 
the location from which the client relationship is managed, 
booking location or the location of the trading desk. 
However, many of the Firm’s U.S. operations serve 
international businesses.
As the Firm’s operations are highly integrated, estimates 
and subjective assumptions have been made to apportion 
revenue and expense between U.S. and international 
operations. These estimates and assumptions are consistent 
with the allocations used for the Firm’s segment reporting 
as set forth in Note 32.
The Firm’s long-lived assets for the periods presented are 
not considered by management to be significant in relation 
to total assets. The majority of the Firm’s long-lived assets 
are located in the U.S.

Note 32 – Business segments
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major 
reportable business segments – Consumer & Community 
Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial 
Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there 
is a Corporate segment. The business segments are 
determined based on the products and services provided, or 
the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in 
which financial information is evaluated by the Firm’s 
Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a 
managed basis. Refer to Segment results of this footnote 
for a further discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s business 
segments.
The following is a description of each of the Firm’s business 
segments, and the products and services they provide to

Segment results 
The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s 
segment results as of or for the years ended December 31, 
2023, 2022 and 2021, on a managed basis. The Firm’s 
definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. 
GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to 
present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the 
reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. 
Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax 
credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the 
managed results on a basis comparable to taxable 
investments and securities. This allows management to 
assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year 
arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The 
corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt 
items is recorded within income tax expense/(benefit). 
These adjustments have no impact on net income as 
reported by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs.
Capital allocation
Each business segment is allocated capital by taking into 
consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of 
similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital 
requirements. ROE is measured and internal targets for 
expected returns are established as key measures of a 
business segment’s performance.
The Firm’s current allocation methodology incorporates 
Basel III Standardized RWA and the GSIB surcharge, both 
under rules currently in effect, as well as a simulation of 
capital in a severe stress environment. At least annually, 
the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to 
allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital 
allocated to the LOBs may change.

(a) Segment results on a managed basis reflect revenue on a FTE basis with the corresponding income tax impact recorded within income tax expense/
(benefit). These adjustments are eliminated in reconciling items to arrive at the Firm’s reported U.S. GAAP results.
(b) In the first quarter of 2023, the allocations of revenue and expense to CCB associated with a Merchant Services revenue sharing agreement were 
discontinued and are now retained in Payments in CIB. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.
As a result of the organizational changes that were announced on January 25, 2024, the Firm will be reorganizing its business 
segments to reflect the manner in which the segments will be managed. The reorganization of the business segments is 
expected to be effective in the second quarter of 2024.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

Note 34 – Business combinations
On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets 
and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank (the 
"First Republic acquisition") from the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), as receiver. The Firm 
believes that the First Republic acquisition is 
complementary to the Firm's existing franchises. The 
acquisition resulted in an estimated bargain purchase gain, 
which represents the excess of the estimated fair value of 
the net assets acquired above the purchase price. 
The Firm has determined that this acquisition constitutes a 
business combination under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, the 
initial recognition of the assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed were generally measured at their estimated fair 
values as of May 1, 2023. The determination of those fair 
values required management to make certain market-based 
assumptions about expected future cash flows, discount 
rates and other valuation inputs at the time of the 
acquisition. The Firm believes that the fair value estimates 
of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed provide a 
reasonable basis for determining the estimated bargain 
purchase gain. 
The Firm and the FDIC have not yet completed the 
settlement process under which the purchase price, and the 
identification of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, 
will be finalized. The finalization of this settlement process 
may impact the amount of the estimated bargain purchase 
gain. The purchase and assumption agreement entered into 
with the FDIC allows for final settlement to occur up to a 
year after the acquisition date. 
In addition, the purchase price and the estimated bargain 
purchase gain could change pending management's 
finalization of its acquisition date fair value estimates for 
certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which 
may take place up to one year from the acquisition date, as 
permitted by U.S. GAAP.
The First Republic acquisition resulted in a preliminary 
estimated bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion. The Firm 
has continued to progress in the settlement process with 
the FDIC and refine its acquisition-date fair value estimates. 
As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2023, 
adjustments totaling $63 million were made, increasing the 
estimated bargain purchase gain to $2.8 billion.
In connection with the First Republic acquisition, the Firm 
and the FDIC entered into two shared-loss agreements with 
respect to certain loans and lending-related commitments 
(the "shared-loss assets"): the Commercial Shared-Loss 
Agreement ("CSLA") and the Single-Family Shared-Loss 
Agreement (“SFSLA”). The CSLA covers 80% of credit 
losses, on a pari passu basis, over 5 years with a 
subsequent 3-year recovery period for certain acquired 
commercial loans and other real estate exposure. The 
SFSLA covers 80% of credit losses, on a pari passu basis, 
for 7 years for certain acquired loans secured by mortgages 
on real property or shares in cooperative property 
constituting a primary residence. The indemnification 
assets, which represent the fair value of the CSLA and 
SFSLA on the acquisition date, are reflected in the total 
assets acquired.
As part of the consideration paid, JPMorgan Chase issued a 
five-year, $50 billion secured note to the FDIC (the 
"Purchase Money Note"). The Purchase Money Note bears 
interest at a fixed rate of 3.4% and is secured by certain of 
the acquired loans. The Purchase Money Note is prepayable 
upon notice to the holder.
The Firm had placed a $5 billion deposit with First Republic 
Bank on March 16, 2023, as part of $30 billion of deposits 
provided by a consortium of large U.S. banks. The Firm's $5 
billion deposit was effectively settled as part of the 
acquisition and the associated allowance for credit losses 
was released upon closing. The Firm subsequently repaid 
the remaining $25 billion of deposits to the consortium of 
banks, including accrued interest through the payment date 
on May 9, 2023.

(b) Includes $447 million of securities financing transactions with First Republic Bank that were effectively settled on the acquisition date.
(c) In the fourth quarter, certain assets and liabilities were reclassified resulting in a $762 million increase to loans, an $870 million decrease to accounts 
receivable and other assets and a $30 million increase to accounts payable and other liabilities.
(d) Other assets include $1.2 billion in tax-oriented investments and $683 million of lease right-of-use assets. Other liabilities include the related tax-oriented 
investment liabilities of $669 million and lease liabilities of $748 million. Refer to Note 14 and Note 18 for additional information.
The issuance of the $50 billion Purchase Money Note, the effective settlement of the Firm's $5 billion deposit and 
$447 million of securities financing with First Republic Bank, and the $3.6 billion payable to the FDIC as part of the purchase 
price consideration are considered non-cash transactions.
The following describes the accounting policies and fair value methodologies generally used by the Firm for the following 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed: core deposit and customer relationship intangibles, shared-loss agreements and the 
related indemnification assets, Purchase Money Note, and FHLB advances. 
For further discussion of the Firm’s accounting policies and valuation methodologies, refer to Note 2 and Note 3 for fair value 
measurement, Note 10 for investment securities, Note 12 for loans, Note 17 for deposits, and Note 28 for lending-related 
commitments.
Core deposit and customer relationship intangibles
Core deposit and certain wealth management customer 
relationship intangibles were acquired as part of the First 
Republic acquisition. The core deposit intangible of $1.3 
billion was valued by discounting estimated after-tax cost 
savings over the remaining useful life of the deposits using 
the favorable source of funds method. The after-tax cost 
savings were estimated based on the difference between 
the cost of maintaining the core deposit base relative to the 
cost of next best alternative funding sources available to 
market participants. The customer relationship intangibles 
of $180 million were valued by discounting estimated aftertax earnings over their remaining useful lives using the 
multi-period excess earnings method. Both intangible asset 
valuations utilized assumptions that the Firm believes a 
market participant would use to estimate fair values, such 
as growth and attrition rates, projected fee income as well 
as related costs to service the relationships, and discount 
rates. The core deposit and customer relationship 
intangibles will be amortized over a projected period of 
future cash flows of approximately 7 years. Refer to Note 
15 for further discussion on other intangible assets.
Indemnification assets - Shared-loss agreements
The indemnification assets represent forecasted recoveries 
from the FDIC associated with the shared-loss assets over 
the respective shared-loss recovery periods. The 
indemnification assets were recorded at fair value in other 
Notes to consolidated financial statements

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

assets on the Consolidated balance sheets on the 
acquisition date. The fair values of the indemnification 
assets were estimated based on the timing of the forecasted 
losses underlying the related allowance for credit losses. 
The subsequent quarterly remeasurement of the 
indemnification assets is based on changes in the amount 
and timing of forecasted losses in the allowance for credit 
losses associated with the shared-loss assets and is 
recorded in other income. Under certain circumstances, the 
Firm may be required to make a payment to the FDIC upon 
termination of the shared-loss agreements based on the 
level of actual losses and recoveries on the shared-loss 
assets. The estimated potential future payment is reflected 
as contingent consideration as part of the purchase price 
consideration.
Purchase Money Note and FHLB advances
The Purchase Money Note is recorded in long-term debt on 
the Consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the 
Purchase Money Note was estimated based on a discounted 
cash flow methodology and incorporated estimated market 
discount rates. 
The FHLB advances assumed in the acquisition are recorded 
in short-term borrowings and in long-term debt. The fair 
values of the FHLB advances were based on a discounted 
cash flow methodology and considered the observed FHLB 
advance issuance rates.
Loans
The following table presents the unpaid principal balance ("UPB") and estimated fair values of the loans acquired as of May 1, 
2023, and reflects adjustments to the acquisition-date fair value of the loans acquired through December 31, 2023.

The table below presents an attribution of net interest income between volume and rate. The attribution between volume and rate 
is calculated using annual average balances for each category of assets and liabilities shown in the table and the corresponding 
annual rates (refer to pages 310-313 for more information on average balances and rates). In this analysis, when the change 
cannot be isolated to either volume or rate, it has been allocated to volume. The annual rates include the impact of changes in 
market rates, as well as the impact of any change in composition of the various products within each category of asset or liability. 
This analysis is calculated separately for each category without consideration of the relationship between categories (for example, 
the net spread between the rates earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities that fund those assets). As a result, changes in 
the granularity or groupings considered in this analysis would produce a different attribution result, and due to the complexities 
involved, precise allocation of changes in interest rates between volume and rates is inherently complex and judgmental.

Glossary of Terms and Acronyms
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

Credit derivatives: Financial instruments whose value is 
derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a 
third-party issuer (the reference entity) which allow one 
party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to 
another party (the protection seller). Upon the occurrence 
of a credit event by the reference entity, which may include, 
among other events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its 
obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of the 
reference entity, neither party has recourse to the 
reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to 
the protection seller for the difference between the face 
value of the CDS contract and the fair value at the time of 
settling the credit derivative contract. The determination as 
to whether a credit event has occurred is generally made by 
the relevant International Swaps and Derivatives 
Association (“ISDA”) Determinations Committee. 
Criticized: Criticized loans, lending-related commitments 
and derivative receivables that are classified as special 
mention, substandard and doubtful categories for 
regulatory purposes and are generally consistent with a 
rating of CCC+/Caa1 and below, as defined by S&P and 
Moody’s.

Embedded derivatives: are implicit or explicit terms or 
features of a financial instrument that affect some or all of 
the cash flows or the value of the instrument in a manner 
similar to a derivative. An instrument containing such terms 
or features is referred to as a “hybrid.” The component of 
the hybrid that is the non-derivative instrument is referred 
to as the “host.” For example, callable debt is a hybrid 
instrument that contains a plain vanilla debt instrument 
(i.e., the host) and an embedded option that allows the 
issuer to redeem the debt issue at a specified date for a 
specified amount (i.e., the embedded derivative). However, 
a floating rate instrument is not a hybrid composed of a 
fixed-rate instrument and an interest rate swap.

LTV: “Loan-to-value”: For residential real estate loans, the 
relationship, expressed as a percentage, between the 
principal amount of a loan and the appraised value of the 
collateral (i.e., residential real estate) securing the loan. 
Origination date LTV ratio 
The LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan. Origination 
date LTV ratios are calculated based on the actual 
appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the 
origination date. 
Current estimated LTV ratio 
An estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current 
estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated 
collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home 
price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area 
(“MSA”) level. These MSA-level home price indices consist 
of actual data to the extent available and forecasted data 
where actual data is not available. As a result, the 
estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do 
not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; 
as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise 
and should therefore be viewed as estimates. 
Combined LTV ratio 
The LTV ratio considering all available lien positions, as well 
as unused lines, related to the property. Combined LTV 
ratios are used for junior lien home equity products.

also uses this financial measure at the segment level, 
because it believes this provides information to enable 
investors to understand the underlying operational 
performance and trends of the particular business segment 
and facilitates a comparison of the business segment with 
the performance of competitors.

Mortgage origination channels:
Retail – Borrowers who buy or refinance a home through 
direct contact with a mortgage banker employed by the 
Firm using a branch office, the Internet or by phone. 
Borrowers are frequently referred to a mortgage banker by 
a banker in a Chase branch, real estate brokers, home 
builders or other third parties.
Correspondent – Banks, thrifts, other mortgage banks and 
other financial institutions that sell closed loans to the Firm.
Mortgage product types: 
Alt-A 
Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than 
subprime loans but have characteristics that would 
disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A 
lending characteristics may include one or more of the 
following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio; 
(iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) 
a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial 
proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a 
borrower does not provide complete documentation of his 
or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income. 
Option ARMs 
The option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustablerate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the 
option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only 
or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option 
ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the 
introductory period. This introductory rate is usually 
significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed 
rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once 
the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate 
charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and 
adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The 
minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest 
accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is 
deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. 
Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which 
converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan 
upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date 
triggers. 
Prime 
Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good 
credit records who meet specific underwriting 
requirements, including prescriptive requirements related 
to income and overall debt levels. New prime mortgage 
borrowers provide full documentation and generally have 
reliable payment histories. 
Subprime 
Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were 
offered to certain customers with one or more high risk 
characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or 
poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than 
80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a 
high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the 
loan is other than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) 
a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.

liabilities
MSA: Metropolitan statistical areas 
MSR: Mortgage servicing rights

components:
Glossary of Terms and Acronyms

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

• Interchange income: Fees earned by credit and debit 
card issuers on sales transactions. 
• Rewards costs: The cost to the Firm for points earned by 
cardholders enrolled in credit card rewards programs 
generally tied to sales transactions.
• Partner payments: Payments to co-brand credit card 
partners based on the cost of loyalty program rewards 
earned by cardholders on credit card transactions.
Net mortgage servicing revenue: Includes operating 
revenue earned from servicing third-party mortgage loans, 
which is recognized over the period in which the service is 
provided; changes in the fair value of MSRs; the impact of 
risk management activities associated with MSRs; and gains 
and losses on securitization of excess mortgage servicing. 
Net mortgage servicing revenue also includes gains and 
losses on sales and lower of cost or fair value adjustments 
of certain repurchased loans insured by U.S. government 
agencies. 
Net revenue rate: Represents Card Services net revenue

NM: Not meaningful
NOL: Net operating loss 
Nonaccrual loans: Loans for which interest income is not 
recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than credit 
card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. 
government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status 
when full payment of principal and interest is not expected, 
regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and 
interest have been in default for a period of 90 days or 
more unless the loan is both well-secured and in the 
process of collection. Collateral-dependent loans are 
typically maintained on nonaccrual status. 
Nonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include 
nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and certain 
assets acquired in loan satisfactions, predominantly real 
estate owned and other commercial and personal property.

that are negotiated, executed and settled bilaterally 
between two derivative counterparties, where one or both 
counterparties is a derivatives dealer. 
Over-the-counter cleared (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives: 
Derivative contracts that are negotiated and executed 
bilaterally, but subsequently settled via a central clearing 
house, such that each derivative counterparty is only 
exposed to the default of that clearing house. 
Overhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage of 
total net revenue.
Parent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Participating securities: Represents unvested share-based 
compensation awards containing nonforfeitable rights to 
dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively, 
“dividends”), which are included in the earnings per share 
calculation using the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase 
grants RSUs to certain employees under its share-based 
compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to 
receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period 
on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of 
common stock. These unvested awards meet the definition 
of participating securities. Under the two-class method, all 
earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to 
each class of common stock and participating securities, 
based on their respective rights to receive dividends. 
PCAOB: Public Company Accounting Oversight Board

disclosure requirements which allow market participants to 
assess the risk and capital profiles of banks.
PPP: Paycheck Protection Program under the Small 
Business Association (“SBA”)
PRA: Prudential Regulation Authority 
Pre-provision profit/(loss): Represents total net revenue 
less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this 
financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a 
lending institution to generate income in excess of its 
provision for credit losses.
Pre-tax margin: Represents income before income tax 
expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in 
management’s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax 
performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs 
are taken into consideration. It is one basis upon which 
management evaluates the performance of AWM against 
the performance of their respective competitors.
Principal transactions revenue: Principal transactions 
revenue is driven by many factors, including: 
Glossary of Terms and Acronyms
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2023 Form 10-K

• the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the 
price at which a market participant is willing and able to 
sell an instrument to the Firm and the price at which 
another market participant is willing and able to buy it 
from the Firm, and vice versa; and 
• realized and unrealized gains and losses on financial 
instruments and commodities transactions, including 
those accounted for under the fair value option, primarily 
used in client-driven market-making activities. 
– Realized gains and losses result from the sale of 
instruments, closing out or termination of transactions, 
or interim cash payments. 
– Unrealized gains and losses result from changes in 
valuation. 
In connection with its client-driven market-making 
activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity 
instruments, derivatives and commodities, including 
physical commodities inventories and financial instruments 
that reference commodities. 
Principal transactions revenue also includes realized and 
unrealized gains and losses related to:

and foreign exchange risk; 
• derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, 
primarily to mitigate credit, foreign exchange and 
interest rate risks.
Production revenue: Includes fees and income recognized 
as earned on mortgage loans originated with the intent to 
sell, and the impact of risk management activities 
associated with the mortgage pipeline and warehouse 
loans. Production revenue also includes gains and losses on 
sales and lower of cost or fair value adjustments on 
mortgage loans held-for-sale (excluding certain 
repurchased loans insured by U.S. government agencies), 
and changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
measured under the fair value option.
PSU(s): Performance share units

Standardized approach and an Advanced approach) which 
include capital requirements for credit risk, market risk, and 
in the case of Basel III Advanced, also operational risk. Key 
differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between 
the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for 
Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive 
approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit 
models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, 
credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory riskweightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and 
asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally 
consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III 
Advanced.

manager to develop a track record. After these goals are 
achieved, the intent is to remove the Firm’s capital from the 
investment.

detachable) derivatives. Contractual cash flows for 
principal, interest, or both can vary in amount and timing 
throughout the life of the note based on non-traditional 
indexes or non-traditional uses of traditional interest rates 
or indexes. 
Taxable-equivalent basis: In presenting results on a 
managed basis, the total net revenue for each of the 
business segments and the Firm is presented on a taxequivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments 
that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is 
presented in managed basis results on a level comparable 
to taxable investments and securities; the corresponding
