We should try to come up \nwith a far more constructive alternative.\nTHE UNDUE INFLUENCE OF PROXY \nADVISORS\nThere are essentially two main proxy advisors in \nthe United States. One is called Institutional \nShareholder Services (ISS), and the second is \ncalled Glass Lewis. These proxy advisors started \nout providing reams of data from companies to \nhelp their institutional investor clients vote on \nproxy matters (information on executive compensation, stock returns, detail on directors, policies \nand so on). However, they soon also began to provide advice on how shareholders should vote on \nproxy matters. And, in fact, institutional investors \ngenerally execute their voting on an ISS or Glass \nLewis platform, which often includes a clear statement of the advisory service’s position.",
