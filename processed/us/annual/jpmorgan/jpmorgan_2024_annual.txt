Dear Fellow Shareholders,
Jamie Dimon, 
Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer
Across the globe, 2024 was yet another year of significant challenges, from 
the terrible ongoing war and violence in Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East 
to ongoing terrorist activity and growing geopolitical tensions, importantly with 
China. Our hearts go out to those whose lives are profoundly affected by these 
events. 
JPMorganChase, a company that historically has worked across borders and 
boundaries, will do its part to ensure that the global economy is safe and secure, 
but it is not immune to the effects of these events. Two things are absolutely 
foundational to the long-term success of JPMorganChase: one is whether 
we run a great company and two, which is maybe more important, is whether 
the long-term health of America, domestically, and the future of the free and 
democratic world are strong. In the first two sections of this letter, I deal with 
these critical issues. And in the third and fourth sections, I talk about specific 
issues unique to JPMorganChase and how we are addressing them, including 
constantly fighting complacency, arrogance and bureaucracy. 

INTRODUCTION

1 Represents managed 
revenue.
2 Adjusted ROTCE of 
20% excludes $5.4 billion 
from net income in 2024 
as a result of the net gain 
related to Visa shares 
and the donation of 
Visa shares to pre-fund 
contributions to the 
Firm’s Foundation. 
This is a non-GAAP 
financial measure.
Despite the unsettling landscape, the U.S. economy, at least until recently, 
continued to be resilient, with consumers still spending (though with some 
recent weakening) and businesses still healthy. It is important to note that the 
economy has been fueled by large amounts of government deficit spending and 
past stimulus. There also remains a growing need for increased expenditure on 
infrastructure, the restructuring of global supply chains and the military, which 
may lead to stickier inflation and ultimately higher rates than markets currently 
expect. The recent tariffs will likely increase inflation and are causing many to 
consider a greater probability of a recession. And even with the recent decline 
in market values, prices remain relatively high. These significant and somewhat 
unprecedented forces cause us to remain very cautious. There is much more 
detail on all of this in section three.
2024 was another strong year for JPMorganChase, with our firm generating 
record revenue for the seventh consecutive year, as well as setting numerous 
records in each of our lines of business. We earned revenue in 2024 of 
$180.6 billion1 and net income of $58.5 billion, with return on tangible common 
equity (ROTCE) of 20%2, reflecting strong underlying performance across our 
businesses. We also increased our quarterly common dividend of $1.05 per 
share to $1.15 per share in the first quarter of 2024 – and again to $1.25 per 
share in the third quarter of 2024 – while continuing to reinforce our fortress 
balance sheet. We grew market share in several of our businesses and continued to make significant investments in products, people and technology while 
exercising strict risk disciplines. 
Throughout the year, we demonstrated the power of our investment philosophy 
and guiding principles, as well as the value of being there for clients – as we 
always are – in both good times and bad times. The result was continued 
broad healthy growth across the firm. The charts on pages 6–12 show our 
performance results and illustrate how we have grown our franchises, how we 
compare with our competitors and how we look at our fortress balance sheet. 
Please peruse them and the CEO and COO letters in this Annual Report, all of 
which provide specific details about our businesses and our plans for the future.
In 2024, we continued to play a forceful and essential role in advancing 
economic growth. In total, we extended credit and raised capital totaling 
$2.8 trillion for our consumer and institutional clients around the world. 

INTRODUCTION

On a daily basis, we move over $10 trillion in 120+ currencies and more than 160 
countries, as well as safeguard over $35 trillion in assets. After we purchased 
and effectively fully integrated First Republic Bank, that bank failure disappeared 
as a negative issue for the U.S. economy. In addition to bringing much-needed 
stability to the U.S. banking system, we were able to give a new, secure home to 
approximately half a million First Republic customers.
While we have modified our approach to certain corporate responsibilities 
to conform to new guidance, we remain committed to reaching out to all 
communities in an effort to create a stronger, more inclusive economy – from 
supporting work skills training programs around the world and financing 
affordable housing and small businesses to making investments in our people 
and in cities like Detroit that show how business and government leaders can 
work together to solve problems. Almost all of these efforts are commercial in 
nature; i.e., “profit seeking” and are no different from what businesses, large and 
small, are trying to do in towns across America.
We have achieved our decades-long consistency by adhering to our key 
principles and strategies (see sidebar on Steadfast Principles on page 5), which 
allow us to drive good organic growth and promote proper management of our 
capital (including dividends and stock buybacks). 
I remain proud of our company’s resiliency and of what our hundreds of 
thousands of employees around the world have achieved, collectively and 
individually. Throughout these recent challenging years, we have never 
stopped doing all the things we should be doing to serve our clients and our 
communities. As you know, we are champions of banking’s essential role in a 
community – its potential for bringing people together, for enabling companies 
and individuals to attain their goals, and for being a source of strength in 
difficult times. I often remind our employees that the work we do matters and 
has impact. United by our principles and purpose, we help people and 
institutions finance and achieve their aspirations, lifting up individuals, 
homeowners, small businesses, larger corporations, schools, hospitals, cities 
and countries in all regions of the world. What we have accomplished in the 
20+ years since the JPMorganChase and Bank One merger is evidence of the 
importance of our values.

INTRODUCTION

Steadfast Principles Worth Repeating 
Looking back on the past two+ 
decades – starting from my time as 
Chairman and CEO of Bank One in 2000 
– there is one common theme: our 
unwavering dedication to help clients, 
communities and countries throughout 
the world. Clearly our financial discipline, constant investment in innovation and ongoing development of our 
people have enabled us to achieve this 
consistency and commitment. In addition, across the firm, we uphold certain 
steadfast tenets that are worth 
repeating. 
First, our work has very real human 
impact. While JPMorganChase stock is 
owned by large institutions, pension 
plans, mutual funds and directly by 
single investors, the ultimate beneficiaries, in almost all cases, are individuals 
in our communities. More than 100 
million people in the United States own 
stocks; many, in one way or another, 
own JPMorganChase stock. Frequently, 
these shareholders are veterans, teachers, police officers, firefighters, healthcare workers, retirees, or those saving 
for a home, education or retirement. 
Often, our employees also bank these 
shareholders, as well as their families 
and their companies. Your management 
team goes to work every day recognizing the enormous responsibility that we 
have to all of our shareholders. 
Second, shareholder value can be built 
only if you maintain a healthy and 
vibrant company, which means doing a 
good job of taking care of your customers, employees and communities. 
Conversely, how can you have a healthy 
company if you neglect any of these 
stakeholders? As we have learned over 
the past few years, there are myriad 
ways an institution can demonstrate its 
compassion for its employees and its 
communities while still strengthening 
shareholder value.
Third, while we don’t run the company 
worrying about the stock price in the 
short run, in the long run we consider 
our stock price a measure of our progress over time. This progress is a function of continual investments in our 
people, systems and products, in good 
and bad times, to build our capabilities. 
These important investments will also 
drive our company’s future prospects 
and position it to grow and prosper for 
decades. Measured by stock performance, our progress is exceptional. For 
example, whether looking back 10 years 
or even further to 2004, when the 
JPMorganChase/Bank One merger 
took place, we have outperformed the 
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and the 
Standard & Poor’s Financials Index. 
Fourth, we are united behind basic principles and strategies (you can see the 
principles for How We Do Business on 
our website and our Purpose statement 
in my letter from 2022) that have helped 
build this company and made it thrive. 
These allow us to maintain a fortress 
balance sheet, constantly invest and 
nurture talent, fully satisfy regulators, 
continually improve risk, governance 
and controls, and serve customers and 
clients while lifting up communities 
worldwide. This philosophy is embedded in our company culture and influences nearly every role in the firm. 
Fifth, we strive to build enduring businesses, which rely on and benefit from 
one another, but we are not a conglomerate. This structure helps generate our 
superior returns. Nonetheless, despite 
our best efforts, the walls that protect 
this company are not particularly high 
– and we face extraordinary competition. I have written about this reality 
extensively in the past and cover it 
again in this letter. We recognize our 
strengths and vulnerabilities, and we 
play our hand as best we can.
Sixth, we must be a source of strength, 
particularly in tough times, for our 
clients and the countries in which we 
operate. We must take seriously our 
role as one of the guardians of the 
world’s financial systems.
Seventh, we operate with a very important silent partner – the U.S. government 
– noting, as my friend Warren Buffett 
points out, that his company’s success 
is predicated upon the extraordinary 
conditions our country creates. He is 
right to say to his shareholders that 
when they see the American flag, they 
all should say thank you. We should, 
too. JPMorganChase is a healthy and 
thriving company, and we always want 
to give back and pay our fair share. We 
do pay our fair share – and we want it to 
be spent well and have the greatest 
impact. To give you an idea of where our 
taxes and fees go: In the last 10 years, 
we paid more than $52 billion in federal, 
state and local taxes in the United 
States and over $26 billion in taxes outside of the United States. Additionally, 
we paid the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation over $11 billion so that it 
has the resources to cover failures in 
the American banking sector. Our 
partner – the federal government – also 
imposes significant regulations upon 
us, and it is imperative that we meet all 
legal and regulatory requirements 
imposed on our company. 
Eighth and finally, we know the foundation of our success rests with our 
people. They are the front line, both 
individually and as teams, serving our 
customers and communities, building 
the technology, making the strategic 
decisions, managing the risks, determining our investments and driving 
innovation. However you view the world 
– its complexity, risks and opportunities 
– a company’s prosperity requires a 
great team of people with guts, brains, 
integrity, enormous capabilities and 
high standards of professional excellence to ensure its ongoing success.

Introduction
— Steadfast principles worth repeating
I. America and the World Are at a Critical Crossroads: Comprehensive 
Action and Leadership Are Imperative Now 
Only America has the economic, military and, yes, moral power.
Celebrate America’s values and virtues, with humility, in order to restore civic pride, 
citizenship and purpose.
Acknowledge and fix our problems at home by regaining common sense and being 
resolute.
Recognize that the best strategy for America’s success is to implement effective 
domestic policies that drive robust economic growth for the benefit of all citizens. 
Initiate comprehensive economic foreign policy to win the new global “economic” 
war. America will be first – but not if it is alone. 
Affirm that our national security and the world’s best military, at whatever cost, are 
paramount and necessary for peace. 
II. A Compendium of Critical Domestic Policies to Drive Growth, 
Opportunity and Well-Being
We need consistent and responsible tax and fiscal policies. 
Our education system is in deep need of reform to create skills, jobs and 
opportunity. 
We must remedy the healthcare system, both to reduce costs and 
improve outcomes. 
We can improve effective regulations while reducing crippling rules, 
demoralization, and arbitrary and expensive litigation. 
We could do a better job supporting small businesses. 
We should have permanent plans to consistently drive the building of great 
infrastructure. 
We can make it easier to build a more affordable housing supply.
We can strengthen our financial system and markets. 
Local democracy works: Let it shine and learn from it. 

III. Specific Issues Facing Our Company
We take a long view in dealing with our excess capital. 
We bring an investor/owner mindset to drive organic growth.
Our largest risk is geopolitical risk. 
We’re not in Kansas anymore: economy, inflation, interest rates, asset prices, 
trade wars, oh my!
Consumer payments have become a new battleground.
We devote significant resources to strategic intelligence to inform change 
and share our knowledge. 
— Powering economic growth in Texas
IV. Management Learnings
Why complacency, arrogance, bureaucracy and BS kill companies. 
You have to get the numbers right.
You need a full and constant assessment. 
You better have great controls. 
You must kill bureaucracy all the time and relentlessly.
Mistakes I made.
What the heck is culture? 
Leading the team.
Why it’s hard to achieve good growth and innovate.
Management tricks and tools. 
 
In Closing

I. America and the World 
Are at a Critical Crossroads: 
Comprehensive Action and 
Leadership Are Imperative Now
Only America Has the Economic, Military and, Yes, Moral Power
I am writing about this topic, both as a patriot 
who cares about America’s and the free world’s 
future and as the CEO of our company, because 
it may be the most critical factor affecting the 
future of JPMorganChase itself. The success of 
JPMorganChase has always been predicated on 
the success of the United States of America and 
the health of the world, particularly the strength 
of free and democratic countries. 
Whether you call them adversaries or major 
competitors, they have made their goal clear. 
We must act now.
The brutal invasion of Ukraine and the indescribable terrorist acts on Israel should have dispelled any illusion that the world is a safe place. 
We do not need another Pearl Harbor or 9/11 to 
shatter any false sense of security based on the 
hopeful notion that dictators, terrorists and 
oppressive nations won’t use their economic 
and military powers to advance their aims – 
particularly against what they perceive as weak, 
incompetent and disorganized Western democracies. Global peace and world order are vital 
American interests. We also need to answer the 
question: What kind of world do we want to live 
in? And do we believe that we can, or should, try 
to make the world a better place? Practically, 
what is the other choice? 
Our international adversaries and major competitors have made it clear that their goal is to 
dismantle American hegemony, which means 
dismantling the rules-based system led by 
America in concert with our allies (essentially 
the Bretton Woods system and the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization, as well as the International 
Monetary Fund and the United Nations). Since 
the end of World War II, this system has brought 
forth the longest period of peace and prosperity 
among the great powers. Today, it is clear this 
system needs serious reform and strengthening, not total destruction. Yet, if given the opportunity, that is exactly what our adversaries want 
to happen: Tear asunder the extensive military 
and economic alliances that America and its 
allies have forged. In the multipolar world that 
follows, it will be every nation for itself – giving 
our adversaries the opportunity to set the rules 
and use military and economic coercion to get 
what they want. That is what is at stake here. We 
need to bring the whole of government and the 
private sector together to build the world we 
want while dealing with the cold realities of the 
world we have. 
We face the most perilous and complicated geopolitical and economic environment since World 
War II. Today’s world is more complex and more 
interconnected than ever before. Comprehensive strategies, diligently deployed, are required 
to address challenges on many fronts: the war 
in Ukraine; terrorism in the Middle East and the 
real possibility that Iran may develop a nuclear 
weapon; Europe’s potential fragmentation; and 
ongoing trade disputes and the rise of China. 
If Iran acquires a nuclear weapon, many other 
nations around the world will seek to acquire 
nuclear weapons, presenting us with a catastrophic situation. A global nuclear arms race 
is the worst outcome that could happen to our 
world – and this may be the greatest threat to 
mankind’s survival. Lastly, it is extremely 
important to recognize that security and 
economics are interconnected – “economic” 
warfare has caused military warfare in the past.
Not only is America’s global leadership role 
being challenged outside our borders by other 
nations but also inside our borders by our 
polarized electorate. 

AMERICA AND THE WORLD ARE AT A CRITICAL CROSSROADS: COMPREHENSIVE ACTION AND LEADERSHIP ARE IMPERATIVE NOW

The actions taken in the next decade may prove, 
depending on how our country and our allies perform, the most consequential of our lives and may 
very well determine the fate of the free and democratic world over the next century. America has 
always had an amazing ability to confront enormous challenges – and we did so by facing them 
head-on with superb leadership from Abraham 
Lincoln to FDR to Dwight Eisenhower. We should 
remember that America, “conceived in liberty 
and dedicated to the proposition that all men are 
created equal,” still remains a shining beacon of 
hope to citizens around the world. 
Here are five things our nation needs to do well 
in order to secure the future we should want for 
our country and our companies. I fear that if we 
fail at one of them, we may fail overall: 
Celebrate America’s values and virtues, 
with humility, in order to restore civic pride, 
citizenship and purpose. 
2. Acknowledge and fix our problems at home 
by regaining common sense and being 
resolute. 
3. Recognize that the best strategy for 
America’s success is to implement effective 
domestic policies that drive robust economic 
growth for the benefit of all citizens. 
4. Initiate comprehensive economic foreign 
policy to win the new global “economic” war. 
America will be first – but not if it is alone.
5. Affirm that our national security and the 
world’s best military, at whatever cost, are 
paramount and necessary for peace.
These are my prescriptions, and I understand 
that some people may disagree with them – and, 
on some issues, I may ultimately be wrong. What 
I am not wrong about, however, is the urgent 
need to face these issues head-on – we should 
not assume that America will overcome them. 
We have always been a resilient nation and have 
overcome significant adversity in the past 
because we faced our challenges and dealt with 
them properly. Problems don’t age well. And the 
consequences of not dealing with this properly 
range from bad to catastrophic.
CELEBRATE AMERICA’S VALUES AND 
VIRTUES, WITH HUMILITY, IN ORDER TO 
RESTORE CIVIC PRIDE, CITIZENSHIP 
AND PURPOSE. 
To be able to attack our problems at home 
and abroad, we must be strong. And our core 
strength is based upon our commitment to our 
values, as well as our ability to work hard and 
think intelligently about our problems. If the soul 
of America is not strong, then the rest will be 
weak. While we should acknowledge America’s 
flaws, they should not be used to pull apart our 
country.
Our values transcend any political stance – 
libertarian, conservative, progressive, Democrat 
or Republican. We need to believe in ourselves 
and get back to work (in the office!), not tear 
each other down. 
America’s strength is not a divine right – it is 
earned by citizens committed to a common 
purpose.
Many of the blind ideologies being bandied 
about run counter to our fundamental principles. 
Our principles of freedom of speech, religion 
and enterprise allow individuals to pursue life as 
they lawfully see fit. Ideologues often adhere to 
rigid beliefs and seek to impose those beliefs on 
others; in extreme forms of fanaticism, there is 
no room for individual differences. 
I applaud many traditional Democratic values, 
such as a commitment to try to lift up all of our 
citizens and to provide more justice and equal 
opportunity. I also deeply respect many traditional Republican values, such as a dedication 
to provide a strong national defense, to promote 
free enterprise and encourage a pro-business 
environment, and to emphasize the importance 
of the Constitution. And we should all support 
other core values, such as family, country, 
self-reliance, respect for workers and common 
sense. These values are not mutually exclusive 
and should be embraced and upheld by both 
parties. We, the people, need to be able to 
embody all these values. 
Even with all of our current problems, billions of 
people, if they could, would leave their country 
and move to ours. Similarly, if most people could 
only invest in one country, they would choose 
the United States. Our exceptionalism is based 

AMERICA AND THE WORLD ARE AT A CRITICAL CROSSROADS: COMPREHENSIVE ACTION AND LEADERSHIP ARE IMPERATIVE NOW

on our freedoms, our liberties, our opportunities 
and our rule of law, all under the protection of 
the Constitution (and the military) of the United 
States of America. You need only to witness the 
deep appreciation of new citizens, who often 
made enormous sacrifices to be here, to feel 
what it must be like when they take the Oath of 
Allegiance to the United States of America – it 
would bring you to tears. 
It is incumbent on us to educate ourselves, our 
fellow citizens and future generations about 
American values and our ongoing pursuit of a 
more perfect democracy. This education should 
start in grammar school – our civic roles and 
responsibilities need to be taught. Our common 
values are transcendent. 
ACKNOWLEDGE AND FIX OUR 
PROBLEMS AT HOME BY REGAINING 
COMMON SENSE AND BEING 
RESOLUTE.
Facts are often used by people to justify what 
they already think, and then populists on both 
sides distort the facts and use them to jazz up citizens around their grievances. But, as former U.K. 
Prime Minister Tony Blair asserts, we need to separate the populists from the grievances because 
many of these grievances are partially rooted in 
truth and must be addressed. The following are 
issues that I believe are causing legitimate frustration and anger in the country today. This list is not 
complete, but let’s acknowledge some of these 
profound challenges. In this section and the next, 
I discuss some possible solutions: 
• Lack of control of our borders. Uncontrolled 
immigration is highly disturbing to affected 
populations around the world and reduces the 
ability to manage legal and needed immigration. In the United States, the number of immigrants has increased by approximately 50% 
over the last 20 years. Once we gain control of 
our borders, I believe most Americans would 
support increasing merit-based immigration, 
including allowing anyone who earns a degree 
here to stay, ensuring there are proper visas 
for seasonal workers, enabling children born 
in this country to remain and providing a rigorous path to citizenship for law-abiding, undocumented immigrants. Healthy and proper 
immigration would bring great talent to our 
country and has been shown to actually help 
grow the economy.
• Too many left behind. Our fellow citizens at 
the lowest income tier have, in fact, been left 
behind, a trend we’re seeing globally. From 
1979 to 2019, wage growth of the top 10% 
income tier was nearly 10 times that of the 
bottom 10% – which, basically, did not 
increase at all. Our very low-income citizens 
experience higher school dropout rates, 
greater joblessness, increased drug use and 
crime in their neighborhoods, and significantly worse health outcomes. They often 
reside in rural areas and in inner cities. So 
while enormous wealth has been created in 
the country, the promise of equal opportunity 
seems unfulfilled for too many for too long. 
• Education, some of the best and some of the 
worst. We have many of the best universities 
(including research universities) in the world. 
However, over the last 20 years, the cost of 
college has more than doubled for both public 
and private colleges, while household median 
incomes have gone up only 18%. Many innercity schools graduate under 50% of their students. And in both high schools and colleges, 
we don’t teach enough skills that lead to 
well-paying jobs. Again, this affects the bottom income tier far more. Equal opportunity is 
clearly not fairly shared. 
• Ineffective and incompetent government. 
Most people do not believe that the government, regardless of party control, is doing a 
good job. For some, it’s the constant bureaucracy, lack of permitting and failing schools; 
for others, it’s the constant anti-business 
sentiment. We struggle to build pipelines, 
upgrade our electrical grid, develop highspeed rails and accomplish other necessary 
goals. Our government seems unable to 
reform and reorganize itself, which is a problem. This is amplified by the fact that many of 
our career politicians have little real-world 
experience, and it shows. We have failed 
at basic common sense. And let’s stipulate 
here that this is not about blaming individual 
workers. We all know that many government 
employees are hard-working, ethical and 
caring citizens doing very important jobs that 
support and protect their fellow Americans. 

AMERICA AND THE WORLD ARE AT A CRITICAL CROSSROADS: COMPREHENSIVE ACTION AND LEADERSHIP ARE IMPERATIVE NOW

• Profligate fiscal management. Most people 
do not believe that giving the government 
more money leads to better outcomes. In fact, 
most people perceive government actions, 
such as special tax breaks, as patronage for 
favored interest groups. Many people think 
the tax system itself is littered with unfair 
loopholes. Government has been fiscally irresponsible and profligate – and even with all 
the money spent, grievances increased. Our 
government estimates that it makes over 
$200 billion in “improper” payments per year. 
Somehow, we have huge deficits and bad 
outcomes.
• A leviathan both too weak and too strong. 
Our state is paradoxically both too weak – 
ineffective at accomplishing essential tasks – 
and overly strong – overreaching in ways that 
undermine fundamental democratic principles like individual freedom and autonomy. 
Over the last few decades, many have felt 
violated by the government’s increasing interventions. This heavy-handedness often 
prescribes not only how we should act but 
also how we should think and feel. 
• Culture wars and virtue signaling. In the past, 
the elite often insulted traditional values of 
family, God and individual success, lecturing 
about their superior values from their comfortable perches and imposing all of this on 
people who believed differently. We have 
implemented many climate policies that do 
not effectively address climate change and 
raise the cost of living. We have stopped 
teaching some important parts of American 
history. Instead of acknowledging America’s 
significant virtues, we denigrate them and 
tear them down. We engage too frequently in 
class warfare and excessively in identity politics; i.e., using race, sex or creed inappropriately. And state laws were passed that actually 
increase crime instead of preventing it. Many 
of these policies hurt the very people they 
were meant to protect most. Many cities that 
paid a high price for their misguided policies 
are now returning to obvious policy goals – 
safe streets, better schools, more housing. 
Unfortunately, more and more people are 
being disrespectful, condescending and 
unwilling to listen to one another. While 
adjustments are needed, it is quite predictable that the pendulum will swing too far in the 
other direction. When all is said and done, let’s 
hope we can all treat each other with a little 
more respect. 
• An imperfect healthcare system. While in 
some ways our healthcare is the best in the 
world, it is also expensive, essentially costing 
almost twice as much as the average healthcare in OECD (Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development) countries. 
Our healthcare system is also lacking in 
preventive care, transparency and proper 
incentives, and leaves too many uninsured. 
• Crippling litigation, bureaucracy and regulation. An effective legal environment, upheld 
by a dependable judiciary, is essential for economic health, protecting rights, ensuring justice, resolving disputes, maintaining checks 
and balances, and supporting innovation. 
However, the current environment is demoralizing and slowing growth. While we all want 
justice through the legal system, our litigation 
system is expensive (far more than most other 
countries), capricious, arbitrary and slow. All 
of this leads to extreme risk aversion – mostly 
on the part of government but often on the 
part of business as well. It is concerning that 
some politicians have grown increasingly 
beholden to the interests of tort lawyers, 
posing real risk to balanced policymaking. 
In some ways, this could be America’s 
Achilles heel. 
• Red tape 2.0. Red tape has always meant 
excessive paperwork, bureaucracy and 
regulations. But it’s been taken to a whole new 
level by people who really like it and want even 
more of it. They have doubled down on regulations and bureaucracy, which also dramatically increased red tape. In so doing, they 
made sure that new rules were written by 
academics with no pragmatic experience, 
guaranteeing that they would be excessive, 
confusing, contradictory and infused with 
ideology. So we need to give credit where 
credit is due. Therefore, I have renamed it 
“BLUE” tape. Even when “blue” tape has been 
shown to slow down economic growth and 
make it hard for businesses and individuals to 
thrive, those who created it excuse the outcome and refuse to change (see Europe). 

AMERICA AND THE WORLD ARE AT A CRITICAL CROSSROADS: COMPREHENSIVE ACTION AND LEADERSHIP ARE IMPERATIVE NOW

• Damaging trade practices, particularly with 
China. While trade has greatly benefited the 
world and many – if not most – American 
citizens, the damage that was done to some, 
while acknowledged, was never rectified. 
Those who suffered felt the sting – both in lost 
jobs and lower wages. We also allowed too 
much unfair trade. Finally, and most important, we failed to protect our national security, 
becoming too reliant on potential adversaries 
for critical products that the military needs 
(more on this later). 
• Selfishness on the part of our citizens and 
elected officials. Whether it is unions fighting 
new technologies or businesses getting tax 
breaks, the focus on “what am I going to get” 
needs to stop. There are 13,000 groups lobbying in Washington, D.C., defending their “special interest.” Rarely do they fight for what is 
good for America. When America’s future 
hangs in the balance or when special interest 
groups wield undue influence, it is time to prioritize principle over profit – and put country 
before company or union. Many in our country 
do this – our uniformed officers in the military 
are an ideal example as they put their lives on 
the line out of a deep belief in our values and 
our country. 
America is still the exceptional nation, but its 
problems demand that we adjust our strategies. 
America has carried the burden of keeping the 
world safe and has made extraordinary efforts, 
including through trade, to improve the lives of 
the citizens of other nations. It is time to rebalance and rebuild but not retreat from the postworld order. A U.S. retreat from international 
leadership will leave a vacuum that may be filled 
by China or other actors that seek to promote an 
alternate set of international rules and norms. 
Both parties contributed to our failures (and 
the media amplifies it).
Many of the grievances I’ve noted existed and 
grew under both parties’ leadership. These 
grievances are frequently amplified by media, 
both traditional and new, that often adheres to 
only one party’s views, which leaves audiences 
blind to all of the issues and consequences of 
flawed policies. For example, when conducting 
interviews, reporters many times reveal their 
biases whether through subtle support or open 
skepticism. Interview subjects may be discredited because of who they are, not because of the 
content of their argument. Much of this is making 
us meaner to each other – a little more kindness 
and understanding would go a long way. I am 
a firm believer that we should constantly talk 
with each other, air our views, hold each other 
accountable and try to respect all sides of an 
argument.
Social media has made this worse, in fact, deliberately worse by using algorithms to manipulate 
as opposed to educate. Networks and platforms 
could meaningfully improve the quality of discourse on the town square both by offering a 
menu of algorithms, as opposed to ones that are 
addictive, and by requiring all users to authenticate their identities, whether they choose to 
speak anonymously or not. In banking, we have 
“know your customer” requirements – social 
media should have them as well. Verifying identities would go a long way toward eliminating 
foreign influence and bots, and would make 
individuals, not the platform, subject to the law. 
We also exist in a nation awash with inaccurate 
and unfair labeling and scapegoating; i.e., Wall 
Street versus Main Street. Who exactly is Wall 
Street in this comparison with Main Street? Large 
business and small business are symbiotic. 
Shouldn’t we respect jobs and workers and the 
companies that create those jobs? And some 
give voice to the view that public sector jobs are 
more virtuous than private sector jobs. Less than 
25 million people work in the public sector and we 
should hold them in high regard – teachers, 
police, firefighters, military, sanitation workers 
and others. All jobs have dignity and purpose, 
and add to the general well-being of the country. 
It is good to remember that the 135 million people 
who work in the private sector generate the 
income that funds the public sector. 
All of these are among the reasons why I believe 
the body politic may be tired and ready to see 
bold disruption. While we need to take proper 
actions, we also need reform and reconstruction. 
In addition, our adversaries mistake our apparent disarray as a sign that we are lazy, weak 
and decadent. Anyone who knows America – 
its work ethic, innovation and morality of most 
citizens – knows this is not true. 

AMERICA AND THE WORLD ARE AT A CRITICAL CROSSROADS: COMPREHENSIVE ACTION AND LEADERSHIP ARE IMPERATIVE NOW

RECOGNIZE THAT THE BEST STRATEGY 
FOR AMERICA’S SUCCESS IS TO 
IMPLEMENT EFFECTIVE DOMESTIC 
POLICIES THAT DRIVE ROBUST 
ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR THE BENEFIT 
OF ALL CITIZENS. 
We need to address the underlying issues causing the grievances that are tearing us apart and 
holding the nation back. By enacting meaningful 
policy reforms to resolve these issues, I believe 
our gross domestic product (GDP) would grow 
by over 3% a year – benefiting all Americans and 
especially those in our lower-income communities. From 2000 to 2024, GDP grew by just over 
2% a year. Had it grown by 3%, which should be 
easily achievable with the right policy decisions, 
our GDP per person would be approximately 
$16,000 higher this year. 
In this section and in the following, I describe 
many of the policies that we need to fix – and, in 
some cases, how to do it. Some of the fixes are 
easy, while others are more challenging. They 
run the gamut from improving the supply side, 
such as education, infrastructure, permitting, 
production capability and technology, to 
addressing the demand side, including fiscal 
and tax policy. All of these are domestic policies, 
which we can fix on our own. Later in this section, 
I talk about foreign economic policies, including 
trade, foreign investment and the U.S. dollar as 
the world’s reserve currency, all of which are 
essential to our country and the world. 
Policy needs to be detailed, comprehensive 
and coordinated to be successful – how you 
describe it politically is a separate matter.
As someone once said, “If you are going to do 
what you already did, you are going to get what 
you already got.” We have the best economy in 
the world, but we must confront our extensive 
flaws and fault lines. We need to build our own 
capabilities and stop the constant under- and 
over-reaction. Our policies must foster healthy, 
sustainable growth, and it’s essential that we 
unite the entire nation – government and business alike – to achieve it. Around the world, we 
observe both effective and counterproductive 
policies. For example, well-intentioned labor laws 
can backfire, as seen in parts of Europe where 
rigid labor regulations have contributed to 
persistently high unemployment. Similarly, 
certain safety net programs may inadvertently 
discourage paid work. On the other hand, streamlined permitting policies show how smart governance can accelerate development and get 
projects built – in short order and safely. Nations 
that implement sound policies are capable 
of achieving remarkable outcomes; consider 
Ireland, Singapore, South Korea and Sweden. 
Even Greece, which used to be Europe’s perennial 
basket case, has managed to turn itself around, 
driven by an exceptional political leader. 
Good political leaders get both the politics and 
the policies, in detail, right. They are constantly 
educating the public instead of just responding 
to it. Our country needs leaders who can guide 
their parties away from catering to the extremes 
and who can collaborate effectively with our 
allies to craft integrated policies that address 
both economic and security challenges – in the 
short and long term. Most important, on the 
home front, we need lawmakers on both sides 
of the aisle to commit to the serious work of 
governing – setting aside partisan divides to 
develop policies that foster economic growth 
and expand opportunities for all Americans to 
succeed. Running for any executive office 
(mayor, governor or president) and running the 
government are completely different things. 
Some quickly figure that out, and some don’t. 
While a good politician must communicate 
policies in a clear, compelling way that resonates 
with the American public, the policies themselves must be well designed to be truly effective. And this is more important today than ever 
before because the future, for both foreign policy 
and economic policy, is fraught with extreme risk. 
We need to promote, not denigrate, 
businesses, large and small. 
On economic policy, the Republicans are right 
to champion business and free enterprise, limit 
excessive government intervention, establish an 
international tax system that has made America 
competitive for the first time in over 15 years, 
and cut back on needless, mind-numbing, 
job-killing regulations. And all of this could be 
done while still maintaining the proper regulation necessary to prevent market abuses and 
safeguard the economic environment. 
Recent Democratic policies, driven by 
often-misguided narratives and an often20

AMERICA AND THE WORLD ARE AT A CRITICAL CROSSROADS: COMPREHENSIVE ACTION AND LEADERSHIP ARE IMPERATIVE NOW

dismissive tone, have left much of the business 
community frustrated and disillusioned. Many 
government agencies and regulators frequently 
criticize business by relying on oversimplified 
and dishonest concepts like “price gouging” to 
justify their stance. They tend to take the isolated missteps of a few companies and use them 
to paint the broader business community as 
unethical. This fuels rhetoric that undermines 
free enterprise and leads to regulatory overreach that frequently exceeds the intent of the 
law. Few in the previous administration actually 
understood business or had any experience running a business – and it showed. Other important policies (for example, infrastructure, the 
CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction 
Act), while well-intentioned, were laden with virtue-signaling and uninformed rules, which limit 
their effectiveness. And instead of fixing endless 
regulations, like permitting, government effectively made them worse. 
It would be wiser to properly educate the public 
about the role of business, large and small. The 
private sector is the engine for investing our 
country’s capital into high-returning areas – it is 
our most effective tool for promoting innovation, 
sustainable growth, productivity and jobs. There 
are more than 30 million businesses in America, 
but within the private sector, it is large companies that are responsible for 85% of the research 
and development (R&D) and nearly half of all 
nonresidential capital investment. Big companies generally have excellent healthcare, wellness, retirement and training programs. 
Every time a new plant is built somewhere, it creates four or five times more jobs in that area, 
usually in small businesses. Small business and 
large business are truly symbiotic. 
INITIATE COMPREHENSIVE ECONOMIC 
FOREIGN POLICY TO WIN THE NEW 
GLOBAL “ECONOMIC” WAR. AMERICA 
WILL BE FIRST – BUT NOT IF IT IS ALONE. 
America’s extraordinary standing in world 
affairs is predicated on our economic, military 
and moral strengths. Our exceptional relationships with our allies largely exist both because 
of the security they receive from America’s military umbrella and our strong economic ties. But 
we are in a new world defined by shifting power 
dynamics, rapid technological disruption and 
rising geopolitical tensions, including China’s 
growing assertiveness. This economic competition and conflict will likely go on far longer than 
the wars on the battlefield. 
The autocratic nations of the world, and some 
of the nonaligned nations, would like to see a 
fragmentation of America’s economic alliances 
and a weakening of our global economic position, including our status as the world’s most 
powerful economy, a leader in innovation and 
holder of the world’s reserve currency. This 
competition has many players, using many tactics, over many years. But our long-term strategic goals should be crystal clear: to maintain the 
cohesion and strength of the Western world, 
including their economies. If the Western world’s 
military and economic alliances were to fragment, America itself would inevitably weaken 
over time.
Economic fragmentation from our allies may 
be disastrous in the long run.
Keeping our alliances together, both militarily 
and economically, is essential. The opposite is 
precisely what our adversaries want. Europe has 
some serious issues to fix. Since 2008, the eurozone’s GDP per person has gone from over 75% 
of U.S. GDP per person to approximately 50%. 
While Europe has received some tough messages from U.S. leaders recently, what European 
leaders should do is seize the moment. European nations know what they need to do: significantly reform their economies so they can grow; 
e.g., finish the economic union to make commerce across their countries easier and more 
efficient, and initiate labor reform and tax reform 
to incent more business growth and more labor 
participation (see the Draghi report). They also 
recognize that they need to materially increase 
their military spend and capabilities. This is 
going to be hard, but our country’s goal should 
be to help make European nations stronger and 
keep them close. 
If Europe’s economic weakness leads to fragmentation, the landscape will look a lot like the 
world before World War II. Each nation will need 
to seek out its own relationships to secure its 
future, and that may very well mean closer relationships with Russia and Iran for energy and 
China for trade and economics. Such moves 
would ultimately make these countries far more 
reliant on China and Russia – over time effectively 

AMERICA AND THE WORLD ARE AT A CRITICAL CROSSROADS: COMPREHENSIVE ACTION AND LEADERSHIP ARE IMPERATIVE NOW

making them vassal states. Economics is the 
longtime glue, and America First is fine, as long 
as it doesn’t end up being America alone. 
We do not need to fear China – we just need 
to get our act together.
Comprehensive economic policy is critical to 
compete with China. There is no more consequential relationship for the world, and this relationship will affect the whole Indo-Pacific region, 
especially our allies: Australia, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea and others. 
Over the last 20 years, China has been executing 
a more comprehensive economic strategy than 
we have. The country’s leaders have successfully grown their nation and, depending on how 
you measure it, have made China the largest or 
second-largest economy in the world. That said, 
many people question China’s current economic 
focus – it continues to be beset by many economic and domestic issues, particularly capital 
misallocation, which have resulted in large real 
estate problems, a weakened financial system, 
policies that inhibit entrepreneurs in their own 
country and an urgent need to accommodate a 
rapidly aging population.
China has its own national security concerns, as 
it is located in a very politically complex part of 
the world. Many of China’s actions have caused 
its neighbors (e.g., Japan, Korea, the Philippines, 
among others) to start to re-arm and draw closer 
to the United States. It also surprises many 
Americans to hear that while our country is 
100% energy sufficient, China needs to import 
10 million barrels of oil a day. It is clear that China’s new leadership has set a different course, 
with a much more intense focus on national 
security, military capability and internal development. That is its right, and we simply need to 
adjust to it.
America still has an enormously strong hand – 
plenty of food, water and energy; peaceful 
neighbors; and what remains the most prosperous and dynamic economy the world has ever 
seen, with a per person GDP of over $86,000 a 
year (this compares with China’s GDP per person of $13,000 in 2024). Most important, our 
nation is blessed with the benefit of true freedom and liberty. 
Starting well over a decade ago, both business 
and government should have focused on certain 
problems with China: unfair trade across multiple dimensions and our reliance on China for 
critical national security-related components. 
While we may always have a complex relationship with China (made all the more complicated 
and serious by its actions in supporting Russia 
in the ongoing war with Ukraine), the country’s 
vast size and importance to so many other 
nations (China is the largest trading partner to 
almost every other nation) require us to stay 
engaged – thoughtfully and without fear. At the 
same time, we need to build and execute our 
own long-term, comprehensive economic security strategy to keep our position safe and 
secure. For example, we need to remain competitive with China in the artificial intelligence 
(AI) race by bolstering our technological 
advancements and reducing our reliance on Taiwan for semiconductor chips. Most of the 
actions we can take to protect our country are 
unilateral and do not need China’s agreement. 
Overall, I believe that respectful, strong and consistent engagement would be best for both the 
United States and China, as well as the rest of 
the world. 
Whether you view China as a competitor or a 
potential adversary, we should work with our 
allies to firmly negotiate an ongoing relationship. 
Tough but thoughtful negotiations over strategic, military and economic concerns – including 
unfair competition – should lead to a better situation for all. If America provides strong leadership, and keeps the Western world together, 
China will be better off forming partnerships 
with a strong Western world than with nations 
like Russia, Iran and others. We should also recognize what critical common interests with 
China we share in combating nuclear proliferation, climate change and terrorism.
What China does so well is manage its country as 
a whole – coordinating government and business 
so that they are able to further some of their strategic goals. We must improve our ability to act in 
a more organized and strategic way to succeed in 
this new global landscape. Simply put, if we keep 
our economy the strongest and maintain the 
strength of our alliances, we will thrive. 

AMERICA AND THE WORLD ARE AT A CRITICAL CROSSROADS: COMPREHENSIVE ACTION AND LEADERSHIP ARE IMPERATIVE NOW

We should promote healthy economic 
alliances, which includes fair trade.
Global trade is enormous, amounting to approximately $20 trillion a year, of which only $2.5 trillion is with the United States. And global trade 
will take place with or without us. We should 
remember that other nations have choices, both 
in the short term and in the long term, and they 
will make these choices in their own self-interest 
based on economics, security and reliability.
Many countries need trade to help grow their 
economies. The European Union, for example, 
has the largest trade network with 40 individual 
agreements. China has applied for and signed 
several new trade agreements (e.g., the Regional 
Comprehensive Economic Partnership, Digital 
Economy Partnership Agreement, and Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for 
Trans-Pacific Partnership). The United States 
lacks trade agreements with some of its closest 
allies, many of whom have signed trade deals 
with China. We should more actively be seeking 
free (and, of course, fair) trade agreements, particularly with strong allies like Australia, Japan, 
the United Kingdom and – we hope one day – 
the European Union. These can be done in a way 
that is clearly beneficial to both sides. 
We already trade with most nations on the planet 
– and, of course, we should always be trying to 
make it better and fairer for America. Deepening 
high-standard trade with key trading partners is 
good economics and great geopolitics. And we 
don’t need to ask many nonaligned nations, like 
India and Brazil, to align with us – but we can 
bring them closer to us by simply extending a 
friendly hand with trade and investment.
There are many ways to combat unfair trade 
– industrial policy is one of them, but it should 
be done right or not at all. 
For hundreds of years, countries have used 
trade practices to get a leg up on other countries. This economic competition is often exercised through industrial and trade policy, and it 
comes in many forms: banning or limiting trade 
(quotas), tariffs, subsidies, grants, tax credits or 
accelerated depreciation, loan guarantees, longterm purchase agreements and capital controls. 
These tools are generally intended to give a 
company or an industry an unfair competitive 
advantage, and when used together, they can 
create unbeatable economies of scale. In their 
harshest form, they can be used by countries 
as a tactic to try to unfairly dominate whole 
industries. This should not be allowed.
There are other unfair trade practices that need 
to be mentioned; e.g., nontrade barriers, such as 
regulations that effectively stop specific types 
of trade and various unfair tax policies that 
range from value-added taxes to a particular 
country’s tax schemes. Many countries use 
some of these tools in various forms (including 
the United States).
So trade agreements have many flaws and need 
to be carefully negotiated. Practices such as 
permitting countries to circumvent trade restrictions imposed on them – for example, allowing 
China to use agreements that it has with other 
nations to bypass tariffs on Chinese goods – can 
and should be stopped. Obviously, where the 
United States is treated unfairly, we should 
demand that those agreements be fixed. It 
would also be good to acknowledge that we 
have sometimes treated others unfairly (for 
example, parts of the Inflation Reduction Act 
unfairly favor American business). 
Industrial policy mechanisms, when used, 
should be as targeted and as simple as possible. 
The cleanest of these is tax credits in various 
forms. Whatever the policy, two rules should not 
be violated: (1) there should be no social engineering and (2) markets should allocate capital, 
not the government – lest the result is a buffet 
where corporate America gorges. The government is simply not good at allocating capital in a 
free market. One example should suffice: In our 
attempt to create a more competitive chip manufacturing industry in the United States (it costs 
two times more to manufacture these chips in 
America, and, therefore, our manufacturers 
would fail if they tried to compete), the government could have given land grants for the land, 
accelerated depreciation and lowered taxes or 
offered tax credits for an extended period. Then 
the companies and the capital markets would 
have competed to decide how best to do this. 
Nonetheless, we need to acknowledge that 
there have been real negative job impacts as a 
result of trade (in 1990, manufacturing created 
18 million jobs in this country versus 13 million 
today), which are usually concentrated around 
certain geographic areas and businesses. So 

AMERICA AND THE WORLD ARE AT A CRITICAL CROSSROADS: COMPREHENSIVE ACTION AND LEADERSHIP ARE IMPERATIVE NOW

any new trade policy should be combined with a 
greatly enhanced and effective Trade Adjustment 
Assistance program, which provides retraining, 
income assistance and relocation for those 
workers directly impacted by trade.
America already trades with more than 200 
countries, territories and regional associations. 
We should strike the best and, of course, the 
most fair trade agreements that we can. And 
we should do this while maintaining our close 
economic relations with our allies. 
What’s the truth about trade deficits? 
Trade deficits, by their nature, are not necessarily good or bad. Even if our country had no net 
trade deficit, it would likely be running deficits 
with some countries and surpluses with others. 
Sometimes a high trade deficit results from a 
country’s extraordinary attractiveness as an 
open investment destination, and these investments help that country grow and prosper. This 
may be true for part of America’s trade deficit. 
However, trade deficits for pure consumption 
may mean a country is slowly selling parts of 
itself to someone else, and I’m not sure that’s 
a good idea. 
Our trade deficit over the last 20 years has 
totaled over $12 trillion, and this is probably too 
large. The other side to the trade deficit is an 
investment surplus, which has resulted over the 
years in foreign investors owning $30 trillion of 
U.S. securities, while U.S. investors own only 
$16 trillion of foreign securities. In 2005, these 
numbers were $6.3 trillion and $4.3 trillion, 
respectively. You can see that, over time, foreign 
investors have come to own an increasing share 
of the United States. (For your information, 
China’s holdings of U.S. assets are approximately 
$1.5 trillion, of which half is U.S. Treasury 
securities.) 
It is good to remember that our trade deficit 
is also driven by our large government deficit. 
Therefore, it is perfectly reasonable for us to 
focus on our “twin” deficits: our $2 trillion fiscal 
deficit and our $1 trillion trade deficit. While the 
numbers in the above paragraph highlight the 
attractiveness of the American economy, they 
also reveal certain underlying risks: If America, 
for whatever reason, becomes a less-attractive 
investment destination, the U.S. dollar and the 
economy could suffer if foreigners sold their 
U.S. assets. 
Our extraordinary energy position is a 
massive competitive advantage, ensuring 
affordable, reliable, safe and ever cleaner 
energy, both for us and critically for our allies. 
The United States has a huge competitive 
advantage in that it is essentially self-sufficient on 
energy – and will be for decades. This reduces 
the cost of so many things in our country (e.g., up 
to 40% of the cost of food is related to energy) 
and makes it much easier for American companies to compete. It’s also an enormous geopolitical benefit for us to be able to export safe, affordable, secure liquefied natural gas overseas to our 
allies. This binds them to us, gives them greater 
security and is economically beneficial for the 
United States. It also has the virtue of being good 
for the climate – as cleaner liquefied natural gas 
replaces dirtier coal.
America should lead the way in generating more 
energy to meet greater demand, including from 
AI, which will require huge amounts of energy. 
And we need an “all of the above” strategy for 
developing renewable energy, as well as tapping 
conventional energy sources. We should not 
forget that to make energy ever more efficient 
and cleaner, we also need more rapid permitting, investment in the grid and access to critical 
minerals. I am convinced that, over time, our 
innovative capabilities will make energy cleaner 
and solve the carbon emissions problem. 
In this country, we have made many mistakes 
around climate policy – and I believe a lot of 
money will ultimately be wasted. We also made 
many bad decisions. For example, we failed to 
build the pipeline that would bring gas from 
Pennsylvania to New York – this would have 
replaced coal (in a cleaner way) and dramatically 
decreased the cost of energy for New Yorkers. 
It’s also important to remember that pollution 
in the United States was significantly reduced 
because we effectively outsourced the production of “dirty” manufacturing, like steel, to other 
nations that have lower emissions standards 
than we do. 
One last point: Billions of people around the 
world still lack access to affordable and reliable 
energy, a fundamental driver of higher and 
healthier living standards. Meeting this demand 
improves lives on a global scale. 

AMERICA AND THE WORLD ARE AT A CRITICAL CROSSROADS: COMPREHENSIVE ACTION AND LEADERSHIP ARE IMPERATIVE NOW

There are many other critical foreign 
economic policies that could be used to 
promote the American economy and protect 
our allies. 
Essentially, they are: 
• We must keep America’s tax system internationally competitive so as not to drive capital, 
companies, intellectual property or people 
overseas. There is a complexity to this 
because so many countries play games with 
their tax systems – but staying competitive 
can be done. It would be a huge mistake for 
America to put itself at a disadvantage – there 
are better ways to collect taxes (more on 
taxes in the next section).
• U.S. development finance institutions, including the two main ones (the U.S. International 
Development Corporation and the ExportImport Bank of the United States), are generally used to develop projects in and support 
exports from developing nations. Our development finance is very small relative to the 
size of our country – in total, America’s development finance investment is approximately 
$60 billion. We are virtually absent compared 
with China. By contrast, China’s governmentled Belt and Road initiative has lent or invested 
$1.4 trillion in 155 different countries. China 
does this to promote its business expansion 
overseas and to enhance its own energy, 
minerals or supply chains. 
In addition to the Belt and Road initiative, China 
has foreign direct investment of approximately 
$3 trillion in the rest of the world. This investment was virtually zero in 2000. By comparison, America’s foreign direct investment totals 
$6.7 trillion. In my travels in Africa and Latin 
America, the absence of American business or 
government investment is palpable. African 
and Latin American nations want more of 
America, but they are getting what they need 
from China. Done right, America could dramatically increase its development finance – it is 
not a giveaway, it can be quite profitable, and it 
has the virtue of promoting America and its 
businesses overseas.
• We need to do a better job, in general, of promoting American business overseas. America’s development institutions can work with 
American businesses far more effectively, for 
instance, by providing political insurance on 
large capital investments. This insurance 
would protect businesses and enable them 
to make investments in unstable regions by 
covering risks like government takeovers or 
political unrest. 
At the same time, while laws like the Foreign 
Corrupt Practices Act have helped reduce 
corruption and level the playing field abroad, 
such laws often put firms at a disadvantage, 
including American firms and international 
firms with a U.S. nexus. The rules can be 
vague, the guidelines are ambiguous and the 
penalties are steep – making impacted 
companies hesitant to compete. This needs 
to be fixed. 
• We need to constantly educate and inform the 
world about America’s values and virtues. We 
don’t need to be condescending or lecturing, 
just consistently educating and sharing – the 
lore of freedom and democracy combined 
with a gentle assist will eventually win the day. 
America’s strong economy plays a critical 
role in preserving the U.S. dollar as the 
world’s reserve currency.
The U.S. dollar is a “fiat” currency. Some say 
this makes the dollar purely a matter of trust. 
This is simply not true. The Federal Reserve, 
which issues dollars, owns assets (mostly U.S. 
Treasuries) supporting each dollar it issues. 
Those assets carry the full faith of the U.S. 
government, backed by its taxing power on the 
most prosperous nation the world has ever seen. 
If you have U.S. dollars, you are essentially free 
to do with them as you see fit – that is not true in 
many autocratic nations. The U.S. dollar is the 
world’s reserve currency because of America’s 
open markets, the strength of our economy and 
our rule of law upholding property rights – all 
protected by the U.S. military. These are also the 
reasons why the United States is such an attractive investment destination for anyone wanting 
to invest their money. 
A well-functioning international monetary system is good for the United States and for our 
allies, particularly since the rules are set by us 
and our allies (although some reform is needed). 
The U.S. dollar is foundational to a healthy global 
economic system, and it’s the cornerstone of 
America’s commanding global influence. The 
strength of our financial system gives America 
considerable clout, not only in allocating capital 

AMERICA AND THE WORLD ARE AT A CRITICAL CROSSROADS: COMPREHENSIVE ACTION AND LEADERSHIP ARE IMPERATIVE NOW

efficiently but also in creating a huge informational advantage for our country. The U.S. financial system writ large is the best in the world – 
with extraordinary knowledge and capabilities, it 
is a critical flywheel of the American economy.
To protect the status of our global economic 
influence and of our reserve currency, America 
also needs to be broadly trusted and reliable. 
Good trade should be enabled to flourish. Sanctions are a powerful tool (against not just financial corruption but global bad actors) – but they 
should only be used judiciously and for the right 
purpose and, generally, done in concert with our 
allies. In addition to the benefits mentioned 
above, being the reserve currency saves the 
United States $100 billion a year at current interest rates. People around the world actually carry 
approximately $2.5 trillion of paper U.S. dollars, 
which, in effect, is borrowing without paying 
interest. 
There is a correlation between the strength of 
our economic and military alliances and our 
status as reserve currency: The stronger our alliances, the stronger our reserve currency status. 
However, the opposite is also true. History has 
shown that as countries become weaker, their 
currency loses reserve currency status. 
AFFIRM THAT OUR NATIONAL 
SECURITY AND THE WORLD’S BEST 
MILITARY, AT WHATEVER COST, ARE 
PARAMOUNT AND NECESSARY FOR 
PEACE. 
In today’s troubled world, we’ve seen several 
stark reminders that national security is and 
always will be paramount even if that idea seems 
to recede in tranquil times. America remains the 
arsenal of democracy and the bastion of freedom for the whole world. We must explain to the 
American public, over and over, how Ukraine 
and the terrorist activity in Israel, fueled mainly 
by the Iranian regime, are the actual battlefields 
of freedom. It is our hope that these terrible 
events have awakened all of us to the fact that 
the world is never safe. As President Ronald 
Reagan once wisely said, “The only way to stay 
safe is peace through strength.” Having the best 
military is expensive, but it is not nearly as 
expensive as dealing with what would happen 
without it. We must maintain the world’s 
strongest military, without question. 
Of course, it is reasonable to expect allies to pay 
their fair share of global military expenses – but 
we should also recognize that it is in our own 
strategic self-interest to keep our allies together. 
The U.S. military presence around the world 
should not be viewed as mere protection for hire 
– it’s a critical pillar of global stability and a 
reflection of our leadership. 
We hope one day there will be a lasting and permanent peace for Israel and the Middle East. 
Ukraine needs a proper resolution – one that 
provides it with sovereignty, stability and security – putting their country on a path to healthy 
growth. Sovereignty means that they are a free 
nation left to make their own decisions. If 
Ukraine is left in a weakened position (meaning, 
essentially, that Russia succeeded), we will see 
a fracturing of America’s military alliances as 
countries, Europe in particular, search for better 
security arrangements. 
One more point about military security: There 
was always a thought that America was far from 
European wars, even though we have been 
dragged into them many times. With the advent 
of cyber war, satellites and hypersonic missiles, 
the world has changed; other countries’ military 
capabilities are already on our doorstep. 
We need to employ all instruments of national 
power. 
The exercise of power isn’t measured by military 
force alone but also includes other instruments 
of national power: diplomacy, economic development, foreign assistance (all done in a strategic, efficient and accountable way) and constant 
education about the benefits of freedom. Again, 
as President Reagan said, “Freedom is special 
and rare. It’s fragile; it needs protection.” Fundamentally, we need to realize that power is also 
based on trust: trust that we will do the right 
thing, that we can do the right thing and that we 
are not just strong but reliable. 
We need to immediately change certain 
policies to secure and enhance our military 
capabilities. 
Sustaining America’s position of power requires 
major changes in the funding and planning of 
our military. This includes major changes in 
trade, production capacity and supply chains to 
make our military as resilient and capable as 
possible. Some specifics will suffice: 

AMERICA AND THE WORLD ARE AT A CRITICAL CROSSROADS: COMPREHENSIVE ACTION AND LEADERSHIP ARE IMPERATIVE NOW

• We don’t have multi-year plans for critical 
military expenditures and often rely on shortterm continuing resolutions to fund our military. This costs the military billions of dollars 
a year and creates instability and uncertainty 
for the defense industry. Switching to multiyear plans could potentially provide $40 billion 
in savings a year (out of a 2024 Defense 
Department budget of almost $850 billion) 
and greater stability for the military. 
• We need to allow greater flexibility on the 
reallocation of money; i.e., to continuously 
innovate (buy the newest drones and other 
items).
• Our stockpiles of vital munitions are seriously 
inadequate – if there was a war in the South 
China Sea, we would run out of missiles in 
seven days. If it were up to me, I would be 
stockpiling ammunition, air and missile 
defense, rare earths and other critical components, importantly to preserve peace.
• We don’t maintain sufficient excess production capacity in our defense industrial base to 
ramp up the production of weapons, if necessary. We don’t even have the proper capacity 
to build battleships anymore. It would be 
rather easy for the government to work with 
the private sector to help maintain factories 
capable of producing military materials that 
would be required at a wartime pace. 
• We also lack sufficient labor necessary to do 
everything outlined above. It can take up to six 
years to train workers on the complex skills 
that are needed to manufacture this equipment – and we don’t have six years. 
• We need to immediately restructure some of 
our trade and supply chains. Surprisingly, 
many of the essential items we would need in 
case of war would come from potential adversaries. These products range from rare earths 
to penicillin and other pharmaceutical ingredients to certain types of steel, semiconductors 
and even some manufactured components. 
We need to use all of the tools at our disposal 
to do this as expeditiously as possible.
• Taking the proper unilateral actions on very 
targeted investment and export restrictions 
(chip making equipment, advanced chips and 
other hard-to-duplicate technology used for 
military purposes) is essential. However, we 
should only expect these kinds of actions to 
slow down our competition, not necessarily 
stop it. 
• Finally, the extraordinary science that comes 
out of our national labs and our exceptional 
universities has been critical to creating 
and maintaining our scientific discoveries 
and advances, which have not only fueled 
America’s economy but have also maintained 
our military superiority. There are lots of 
complaints – some legitimate – about 
America’s elite universities, but this cannot 
and should not be one of them. 
Protecting our country goes way beyond just the 
military and includes, among other items, grid 
security, data centers, communications and 
cybersecurity in general.
Foreign policy is realpolitik. 
America’s alliance system is the foundation of 
our geopolitical advantage and is the special 
sauce of American leadership. Foreign policy 
must be grounded in realpolitik – a pragmatic 
approach that prioritizes national interest over 
ideological considerations. Realpolitik means 
that many decisions are properly subordinated 
to national security. For example, while addressing global challenges, like climate change, is 
important, such efforts should not overshadow 
the strategic imperatives of our foreign 
relations. 
We need to bring our allies along and help them 
build their own capabilities. A weak Europe is 
ultimately very bad for America. Among other 
things, our allies need reliable, safe, secure and 
affordable energy – or they will be in a terrible 
position. Diplomacy and our economic relationships, including trade, are a critical part of maintaining these alliances. While we should educate 
other nations about the virtues of our values, we 
should stop lecturing – we don’t need them to 
have all our values, but we do need them to be 
strong allies.

AMERICA AND THE WORLD ARE AT A CRITICAL CROSSROADS: COMPREHENSIVE ACTION AND LEADERSHIP ARE IMPERATIVE NOW

We should do everything we can to drive healthy 
growth in the economy. By doing so, we create 
the resources to constantly reinvest in our 
country, and we create the conditions to promote greater opportunity and well-being for all 
our citizens. In this section, I describe nine critical policies that I believe are essential to making 
our economy strong – putting us in the best 
position to deal with any issue in front of us, 
economic or geopolitical, and guaranteeing our 
ongoing military and economic predominance. 
In compiling this list, I tried to look at the United 
States as I would any large complex company 
that we might acquire. (Of course, our country is 
much more complicated than any one company.) A full assessment of all critical issues 
allows you to develop a game plan. The issues 
I’ve highlighted – and there may be more – are 
those that I believe are holding us back and 
causing much of the “grievances” I wrote about 
in the first section. In all cases, I tried to be practical in my approach, and, in some cases, I offer 
ideas for potential fixes. 
I tried to look at this without regard to how positions might be labeled; i.e., conservative, liberal, 
progressive, red or blue. Whether my views are 
right or wrong, it is critical that we start to fix 
that which is broken.
Government as a whole needs to demonstrate 
to the American public that it is effective, 
efficient, competent and principled – as any 
institution should do – in developing policies 
that are conducive to maximizing long-term 
growth, jobs, competitiveness and fairness – 
without micromanaging the economy.
The government, like all institutions, should 
continuously prioritize and allocate resources to 
streamline its operations and reduce red tape to 
improve service delivery, enhance responsiveness and achieve cost efficiencies. Every 
department should focus not just on the amount 
of money spent but on what it expects the outcomes should be, what the outcomes actually 
are and how it can deliver more at a lower cost. 
Instead, we have a broken bureaucracy that fails 
to fully acknowledge or effectively deal with our 
biggest problems. Even worse, the power of the 
government over the years has been used to 
attack parties, businesses and individuals, particularly those not in favor by the party in power. 
This needs to stop. It begins by always reminding the American public about the founding 
principles of the United States of America – the 
principles embedded in our Declaration of Independence and the Constitution – liberty, freedom, individual rights and justice for all. 
The economic machine is extraordinarily 
complex. We need to focus on proper policies 
that are conducive to growth. Micromanaging 
coupled with misguided, ill-informed policies 
not based on reality and pragmatism often 
have huge unintended consequences. People 
frequently twist accurate data with bad logic to 
kill good policy. Many times, it is easier to throw 
money at a problem, mostly on the demand side 
(i.e., spend more money), than to formulate good 
policy or spend money appropriately to help the 
supply side. Good supply-side policies, such as 
those promoting job creation and infrastructure 
development, are critical to achieving productivII. A Compendium of Critical 
Domestic Policies to Drive Growth, 
Opportunity and Well-Being
A COMPENDIUM OF CRITICAL DOMESTIC POLICIES TO DRIVE GROWTH, OPPORTUNITY AND WELL-BEING

ity and, therefore, to maximizing long-term 
growth. While innovation is the cosmological 
constant always driving growth, sometimes its 
downside is used to block it. This is a huge mistake. We should foster innovation and then create policies that help those who are negatively 
affected.
WE NEED CONSISTENT AND 
RESPONSIBLE TAX AND FISCAL 
POLICIES. 
America could benefit from a bipartisan, binding 
mechanism to achieve fiscal responsibility, similar to a Simpson-Bowles type of commission – 
but with real congressional authority. Some 
countries, such as Sweden, have implemented a 
fiscal policy framework with specific guidelines. 
Sweden’s framework establishes a debt-to-GDP 
ratio of 35% plus or minus 5%. This allows the 
country to run deficit financing at the same rate 
as its economic growth and still maintain a debtto-GDP ratio of 35%. Adhering to this kind of 
consistent fiscal standard makes it easier to 
manage the country in general. The United 
States should eventually establish similar guidelines that would make it easier to run this “ship of 
state” and reduce the uncertainty that results 
from constant flip-flopping between sometimes 
radically different fiscal policies. 
Additionally, we should eliminate the debt ceiling. The debt ceiling is essentially a “weapon of 
mass destruction” that can be misused by politicians who don’t understand the damage it can 
do. It’s hard to even contemplate the harm that 
would be done to the trust in America and in our 
economy if we actually failed to meet our debt 
obligations. 
We must learn to account for investments 
differently from the way we account for 
expenses, particularly in areas such as 
infrastructure.
The lack of proper accounting by the U.S. government is astounding and is almost laughable. 
Unfortunately, the practice drives terrible decision making. For example, in determining the 
deficit, the government treats investments in 
infrastructure (roads, hospitals, ports) the same 
way that it treats expenses. But we should put 
them in completely different budgetary categories. Good investment spending has long-term 
productivity benefits that many expenses do not. 
The United States now spends only 0.55% of its 
GDP on infrastructure. The OECD average is at 
0.81%, and China’s is a staggering 5.56%. We 
need to spend more money on productive infrastructure, not less. Borrowing to invest is fundamentally different from borrowing to consume.
The government also makes a lot of loans, but it 
doesn’t have to account for them in the same 
way that a bank does – which makes bad lending 
easy to do. For example, the government continues to extend a significant amount of student 
loans with improper or no underwriting. When 
the student loan system was taken over by the 
government in 2010, loan losses had been reasonable, and loans outstanding were $750 billion. Through the magic of government accounting, the government actually forecasted more 
than $60 billion in profit from when they took 
over the program. Thirteen years later, the outstanding debt from student loans has more than 
doubled to $1.6 trillion, and we estimate that the 
government has lost, with proper accounting, at 
least $500 billion. Yet the government continues 
to make many of these bad loans. 
The stakes are even higher regarding the government’s control of two of the largest financial 
institutions in the world, Fannie Mae and Freddie 
Mac, whose combined assets of $7.7 trillion 
largely represent mortgages these organizations have guaranteed. It is incumbent on our 
government to properly manage institutions like 
these to protect U.S. taxpayers from tremendous losses (they lost $265 billion in the great 
financial crisis) and to shield U.S. and global 
economies from severe damage. 
To make the U.S. tax system conducive to 
economic growth and job creation, we should 
incorporate these overall objectives:
• Be agnostic to specific industries, setting 
aside favoritism. 
• Offer a system that is stable with standards 
consistently applied. 
• Ensure that our practices keep the United 
States competitive with other countries.
• Provide effective incentives for growth and 
innovation. 
A COMPENDIUM OF CRITICAL DOMESTIC POLICIES TO DRIVE GROWTH, OPPORTUNITY AND WELL-BEING

The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) took 
significant steps toward achieving these goals 
by (1) broadening the tax base, (2) reducing the 
federal corporate rate to 21% (which is approximately the OECD average) and (3) reforming the 
international tax rules. The first point is sometimes forgotten: While the reduction of the headline tax rate from 35% to 21% was projected to 
reduce corporate taxes by $1.4 trillion (over 10 
years), the broadening of the base offset $1 
trillion of that reduction. Regarding international 
tax rules, a key part of that reform was the 
removal of gimmicks that allowed U.S. corporations to indefinitely defer tax rules on their overseas earnings. As a result, our international tax 
system strikes about the right balance between 
recognizing the importance to U.S. companies 
of serving overseas markets while not incentivizing them to move capital, skills and R&D outside 
the country. 
Although there is certainly room for improvement, overall, the changes made by the TCJA 
recognize that reducing and rationalizing taxes 
on business income are critical to spurring economic growth and producing more “bang for the 
buck” than cutting taxes on individual income. 
Importantly, these reforms benefited most 
Americans. In the first two years after the TCJA 
went into effect, we saw real median income rise 
more than in the previous 10 years and the lowest unemployment rate for adults without a high 
school diploma.
In the year following enactment, we also saw 
GDP growth of 3% and a 20% increase in domestic investment for affected firms. Corporate 
taxes paid have risen to record levels – not 
because the tax burden on corporations was 
increased, but because corporations were 
more profitable; they were doing more business, 
hiring more people, making more investments. 
None of this would have been possible without 
a competitive corporate tax rate.
Our Internal Revenue Code can be further 
amended to incentivize growth and ensure a 
fairer tax system overall. 
On the first point, our tax system should provide 
effective incentives for growth and innovation to 
support entrepreneurs and small businesses. 
Two such examples were in the tax code for 
decades before Congress recently phased them 
out: (1) recognizing the importance of capital 
investments and (2) increasing expenditures for 
R&D. Both are proven ways of growing the economy and creating jobs.
As to ensuring a fairer system, there are still 
numerous provisions for Congress to go after. 
On the business side, the rules intended to prevent artificial shifting of taxable income outside 
the United States need strengthening and a 
number of specific industry tax breaks need 
eliminating. On the individual side, there are also 
many tax breaks that primarily benefit a certain 
segment of the population: the wealthy. These 
include carried interest, the ability to deduct up 
to $10,000 of state and local taxes, and too 
many creative estate tax planning techniques. 
These tax breaks not only cost revenue but also 
have the additional stigma of being perceived by 
the American public as just another example of 
institutional bias and favoritism toward a special 
interest group. And consistent with ensuring a 
fairer system, the U.S. tax code should incorporate the “Buffett Rule” so that high-income 
earners pay a minimum tax on realized income. 
Everyone, including the wealthy, would benefit 
enormously from the increased growth that 
would follow if we amended our system the 
right way. I think many people would have fewer 
objections to paying a slightly higher tax rate if 
they thought the money was being used wisely 
to attack America’s biggest problems.
Finally, the tax code plays an important role in 
helping to raise up those at the bottom of the 
economic ladder. This includes incentives to 
ensure an adequate and affordable housing 
supply, such as the credit provision for building 
affordable housing. It’s important that any tax 
credit and social benefit program be properly 
phased in so that it doesn’t dis-incent work. One 
way the code could incentivize labor force participation is to expand and reform the Earned 
Income Tax Credit (EITC). The EITC gives an 
A COMPENDIUM OF CRITICAL DOMESTIC POLICIES TO DRIVE GROWTH, OPPORTUNITY AND WELL-BEING

individual earning $14,000 a year with two children a $5,600 tax credit (and with no children a 
$350 tax credit). I would almost double this tax 
credit and remove the child requirement. While 
this would cost a lot of money, it has many virtues. It would give those with lower income far 
more money to spend, without government 
interference, on what they and their families 
need – education, food, better housing and 
more. And much of it would be spent locally, in 
lower-income neighborhoods. It has the virtue of 
rewarding work, which would grow the GDP. 
Jobs not only bring dignity but better social outcomes in terms of less homelessness and crime, 
improved health outcomes and more household 
formation, among other benefits. For many people, that first job is just the first rung on the ladder of a career. I have little doubt that this plan 
would more than pay for itself over time. Many 
Republicans and Democrats support this program as it helps create the American Dream for 
many people.
OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM IS IN DEEP 
NEED OF REFORM TO CREATE SKILLS, 
JOBS AND OPPORTUNITY. 
Much of our education system no longer truly 
meets our country’s promise that its students 
graduate with the skills they need to attain a 
good job. The American Dream itself rests upon 
our providing, as best as we can, equal opportunity to all our citizens. Education and jobs are 
still the best way to achieve this. That certainly 
can’t happen when so many of our schools are 
not working. 
In a number of our inner-city high schools, under 
50% of the students graduate, and those who do 
often don’t have the skills they need to hold a 
well-paying job. Increasingly, poverty has 
become intergenerational.
The growth of America was always driven by 
productivity that matched capital investment 
with skills, which is also the driver of individual 
incomes. Fortunately, all we need to do is reorient what we do today. No investment is required. 
It is essentially free; we just need to redirect 
existing resources (the United States spends 
almost $1 trillion a year on K-12 education) into 
better outcomes. 
Let’s begin with a refresh of our country’s 
workforce training system.
Effective workforce training systems that align 
education, training and the private sector are 
necessary for securing well-paying jobs. There 
are many successful examples, but one will suffice. Aviation High School in Long Island City, 
New York, teaches its students not just the basic 
high school curriculum but also how to maintain 
small aircraft; i.e., hydraulic, engine and electrical systems, and other technical skills. Some 
students travel several hours a day to get to 
school, and often parents are the driving force 
behind their child’s enrollment. The school 
graduates about 450 students annually, many of 
whom go directly into the aviation field. These 
young people are currently earning in the range 
of $80,000 a year (not including overtime) from 
major U.S. airlines who are in desperate need of 
these types of skilled workers. 
Schools like this are the template we need to 
follow, modernizing education and workforce 
development programs to be responsive to 
current workforce needs. The advent of AI and 
technological change will require lifelong learning and re-skilling. Career and Technical Education programs and alternative pathways, such as 
apprenticeships, earn-and-learn programs and 
work-based learning, also provide effective 
career entryways.
Reforms to credentialed programs could also 
increase access to careers with a future and 
reward experience. We know exactly what to do, 
though systems change is hard. There are millions of jobs available for which training could be 
done in high school, community college or special programs outside of school. For example, 
there are training programs lasting 12-24 weeks 
A COMPENDIUM OF CRITICAL DOMESTIC POLICIES TO DRIVE GROWTH, OPPORTUNITY AND WELL-BEING

in coding, advanced manufacturing, cyber, data 
science, program management, and nursing and 
healthcare-related areas. These trainings 
should be certified and counted as credits for 
undergraduate or graduate education. Many 
unions run excellent apprenticeship and training 
programs that certify workers for badly needed 
high skilled jobs like welding, electrical work, 
plumbing and others. These jobs can pay well in 
excess of $100,000 a year. 
Two other points: Pell Grants, which are government grants awarded to students to help pay for 
eligible two-year or four-year colleges, should 
be available for work credential programs. In 
addition, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act should be reauthorized to support 
Second Chance initiatives that give returning 
felons an opportunity to receive training to 
re-enter the workforce. 
Higher education costs too much and is 
insufficiently linked to outcomes.
Many people who graduate from college are 
successful not solely because of their college 
degree. Their opportunities stem from their 
socioeconomic circumstances – how and where 
they grew up – which offer them knowledge, 
confidence, and often internships and relationships within the workplace that give them a leg 
up. Even with all of that, over 30% of those who 
obtain college degrees face underemployment; 
i.e., low-paying jobs. They, too, need skills. You 
can major in philosophy or history, but a credential of value in coding, data science and analytics, graphic design, financial accounting, digital 
marketing or engineering can lead to jobs making $80,000+ a year. 
Some portion of higher education funding 
should be linked to outcomes focusing less on 
graduation and employment rates and more on 
income levels of graduates. 
The federal student lending system needs to be 
reformed to help ensure that the borrower’s 
education is leading to a good-paying job. This 
would be better for the student, would reduce 
future loan losses and would discourage simply 
driving education costs up.
Early childhood education is critically 
important (it’s a long-term investment so 
start now).
Early childhood education is a long-term investment so it is important to start now. Universal 
pre-K and other early childhood programs 
enhance educational outcomes and increase 
parent labor-force participation. Almost every 
study I have seen shows the tremendous return 
on this investment (some even showing two to 
four times for every dollar invested) even though 
it appears as a cost in the early years. Included 
among the positive outcomes for both the parent and the child are early childhood education 
and higher levels of income, good health and 
parental employment. 
All students should receive a basic financial 
education.
Financial education should be taught as part of 
the K-12 education system. Everyone, and in particular our young people, should understand the 
basics: the need for a rainy day fund, how to look 
at savings, the value of a checking account 
(versus payday lending), the value of homeownership, the importance of saving for retirement 
and other basic principles. Specific financial 
coaching delivered simultaneously with opening 
a first bank account would also be very effective. 
Teaching health and well-being in grades 
K-12 would benefit all our citizens.
A basic understanding of health, exercise and 
nutrition would be a huge benefit for our society. 
Ninety percent of our nation’s $4.5 trillion in 
annual healthcare expenditures are for people 
with chronic conditions (certain cancers, heart 
disease, diabetes, obesity, musculoskeletal disorders and mental health). Preventive medicine 
and early interventions to manage these diseases, especially those directly related to 
behaviors (smoking, drinking, poor exercise and 
nutrition) can have significant health and economic benefits. One small but meaningful example: Cigarette smoking costs the United States 
more than $240 billion in healthcare spending. 
This could be reduced every year if we could 
prevent young people from starting to smoke 
and help those who do smoke to quit.

WE MUST REMEDY THE HEALTHCARE 
SYSTEM, BOTH TO REDUCE COSTS AND 
IMPROVE OUTCOMES. 
America has among the best and worst of 
healthcare. While we may have the best doctors, 
hospitals, pharmaceutical industry, medical 
devices and more, our average outcomes are 
not good, and our costs are double those of our 
global competitors (17% of GDP versus 9% in 
other countries). In addition, 27 million people 
don’t have insurance, and, as mentioned above, 
preventable chronic diseases run rampant. 
Our healthcare system also lacks transparency 
around costs, pricing and proper incentives 
since the user never effectively pays the full 
price. We need to begin reform right away.
A few simple policy changes would go a long 
way toward improving all of this:
Healthcare data should be tabulated in a 
consistent way across all healthcare organizations and providers.
2. All healthcare data should belong to the individual and, therefore, be transferable (and 
not used for unauthorized purposes by 
anyone).
3. Increasing transparency for both the companies and the patients is essential, ensuring 
clarity about the cost of care. Additionally, 
patients should understand what their medicines will cost them and be eligible for volume discounts, including rebates. 
4. Healthcare would be more affordable if the 
exchanges were national and offered a 
broader range of insurance options people 
could buy.
Better data and more consistent standards 
across Medicare, Medicaid and commercial 
markets are needed, with transparency and 
elimination of fraud and waste being key to stabilizing markets and portability being important 
for empowering patients.
Engaging employees by prioritizing health education and literacy can help make them 
informed consumers of healthcare and wellness. 
Addressing the significant problem of medical 
bankruptcy in the United States is crucial, and 
medical bills should not be calculated as part of 
credit scores.
One day, individuals should be responsible for 
purchasing their own healthcare. Healthcare 
should not be an annual purchase – you should 
be able to make a long-term buy, which means 
you would be the beneficiary of taking care of 
your own health.
One final point. Over the last 100 years, the 
health of our citizens and our workforce has 
played a significant role in increasing productivity for American workers. Some studies show 
that over the last 25-30 years, this may have 
accounted for as much as 45% of productivity 
growth over time. Healthier workers and the participation of older workers (due to their accumulated knowledge and wisdom) are the main 
reasons. 
WE CAN IMPROVE EFFECTIVE 
REGULATIONS WHILE REDUCING 
CRIPPLING RULES, DEMORALIZATION, 
AND ARBITRARY AND EXPENSIVE 
LITIGATION. 
I don’t even know where to begin! How did the 
can-do, commonsense practical America end 
up here? Clearly, something is broken. We have 
gotten to the point where we barely talk about 
improving our regulations. We only talk about 
adding more – contributing to endless, 
mind-numbing and demoralizing bureaucracy. 
Studies show that the cost of our regulations 
(which do have some productive outcomes) is 
over $3 trillion annually. J.P. Morgan Global 
Research estimates that relative to the United 
States, more restrictive regulation reduces longterm growth in the five largest European Union 
economies by 0.8% per year, and in China by 
2.4% per year. These regulations are at the federal, state and local levels, and they affect every 
industry and business, small and large. They 
range from permitting and licensing to employment rules and tax compliance (and much 
more). Each of these rules could easily be fixed. 
Take permitting, for example. Various regulators, state and federal, should be forced to 
approve projects sequentially. Some countries 
(Singapore and Canada) have rules to reduce 
permitting timelines substantially to two years 
or fewer (ours can take over 10 years). Regulations shouldn’t be like concrete (immovable) – 
they should be constantly improved. U.S. law 
already requires major rules and regulations to 
A COMPENDIUM OF CRITICAL DOMESTIC POLICIES TO DRIVE GROWTH, OPPORTUNITY AND WELL-BEING

have a cost-benefit analysis done – this needs to 
be fully enforced. There are hundreds of rules to 
fix. Often these regulations are targeted at the 
financial and technology sectors, whose industries help drive our dynamic economy. 
The cost of our tort system is over $500 billion a 
year, a little more than 2% of our GDP. While the 
tort system plays an important role in compensating victims and deterring irresponsible 
behavior, our system is capricious and arbitrary. 
Since the loser never pays, there is a great 
incentive for someone to sue and for the person 
being sued to settle. Much of the compensation 
never even gets to the victims. These costs 
are two-and-a-half times the average level of 
eurozone countries. One example of a major 
improvement would be Florida’s recent reforms, 
which seem to have both reduced the excessive 
cost of torts to the system while giving people 
better odds of proper recompense.
These excessive regulatory and litigation costs 
result in higher costs across the whole economy, 
including infrastructure, utilities, education and 
other essentials. Proper federal, state and local 
regulations, along with permitting reform, are 
necessary to reduce delays and litigation. Minimizing red tape would make it easier, cheaper 
and faster to build infrastructure such as roads, 
schools, bridges, energy facilities and homes. A 
little common sense would go a long way.
One last point: Excessive regulations make 
it much harder to start a new business, and 
they often reduce competition. And they 
almost always hurt smaller companies more 
than larger ones. 
WE COULD DO A BETTER JOB 
SUPPORTING SMALL BUSINESSES. 
Small businesses power job growth in America 
– they account for two-thirds of new jobs and 
employ nearly half of the American workforce. 
Our entrepreneurial ecosystem has been the 
envy of the world for generations, and it is 
essential to create a policy environment that 
facilitates small business creation, growth and 
continuity. 
Business starts have been above-trend for several years, but the failure rate remains high – 
50% fail in the first five years. Public-private 
partnerships can help fill the capital gap in the 
white space between venture funding and bank 
lending. 
Small business owners in low-to-moderate 
income areas face more headwinds than those 
in wealthier communities, so tax benefits and 
community education programs play an important role in helping communities lift themselves 
up through commerce. While banks will remain a 
critical supporter of small business in their 
growth phase, the Small Business Administration’s role is crucial and agency modernization 
must remain a priority, including reforms to the 
Small Business Investment Company program 
and the National Technical Assistance program. 
Finding qualified talent is the #1 challenge facing small businesses owners, and nearly 40% of 
them have job openings that they can’t fill. Public partnerships with trade schools and community colleges can increase the supply of skilled 
labor. As mentioned in the education section, 
there are many ways to increase the supply of 
skilled labor.
Innovative healthcare legislation can reduce 
healthcare costs and help small businesses 
compete with larger employers for talent. 
Just like for larger businesses, there is a need for 
predictability in tax policies, litigation processes 
and the EITC – over 15% of small business owners cite these issues as their most pressing 
problems. Many small businesses face a heavier 
burden from state and local regulations than 
from federal ones so seeking best practices 
from multiple jurisdictions to streamline requirements can support business operations and 
growth.
Finally, we must prepare for the coming “silver 
tsunami” in small business – 75% of business 
owners would like to exit their business in the 
next decade, representing trillions of dollars in 
business wealth at stake. There will be substantial turnover in small businesses in the next 
decade, and we must prepare the next generation with the skills and passion to take the baton. 
Local communities can help protect their tax 
and employment base by investing in succession and transition education programs.
A COMPENDIUM OF CRITICAL DOMESTIC POLICIES TO DRIVE GROWTH, OPPORTUNITY AND WELL-BEING

WE SHOULD HAVE PERMANENT PLANS 
TO CONSISTENTLY DRIVE THE BUILDING 
OF GREAT INFRASTRUCTURE. 
Every state, city and municipality should have 
multi-year infrastructure plans. Improper planning and ineffective execution are rampant, 
costly and potentially dangerous. Waiting for 
bridges to be near collapse or airports to be 
overly crowded is a bad idea. This planning 
could include manufacturing sites, maritime, 
grids, housing, pipelines, canals, broadband and 
highways, to name but a few. 
WE CAN MAKE IT EASIER TO BUILD A 
MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUPPLY.
To address the housing supply issue, it is 
important to increase funding for effective, 
affordable housing production programs. This 
can be partially and easily achieved by expanding the already successful Low-Income Housing 
Tax Credit programs. Additionally, incentivizing 
investments that increase economic opportunity in disinvested communities is crucial, and 
making the New Markets Tax Credit program 
permanent would support this goal. 
In terms of mortgages, reducing unnecessary 
regulations would decrease homeownership 
costs. Streamlining loan origination and servicing standards, reducing capital requirements 
and simplifying securitization rules would 
reduce the cost of mortgages without making 
them riskier. These simple reforms could lower 
the cost of mortgages by 70–80 basis points. 
The costs of unnecessary regulation go beyond 
price - they impact the availability of credit and 
who can qualify for a mortgage. The Urban Institute estimates that a reduction like this would 
increase mortgage originations by 1 million per 
year and help lower-income households, in particular, buy their first home. This would specifically help individuals buy homes in the 
$150,000–$300,000 range. Buying a home, still 
a pillar of the American Dream, is simply the 
best way for individuals to start building household wealth.
Good and consistent local zoning requirements 
– that are executed with a sense of urgency – are 
essential in building more affordable housing. 
Finally, the availability of more housing, particularly lower-income housing (it’s generally more 
economical to build denser housing than 
detached housing), would help people move out 
of rental properties sooner and reduce rents for 
those who do continue to rent.
WE CAN STRENGTHEN OUR FINANCIAL 
SYSTEM AND MARKETS. 
While we have the best financial system in the 
world, it can always be improved. And of course, 
our financial system should have good consumer protections to prevent Americans from 
being tempted to purchase bad products or 
being misled, as well as strong regulations to 
protect the country from the failure of financial 
institutions. Since the great financial crisis (the 
financial system deserved a lot of the negative 
attention it received), we’ve made many 
improvements to regulations. However, as usual 
in a crisis, we also overreacted. 
Fundamentally, we need a dynamic regulatory 
structure that facilitates growth and innovation 
rather than one that continuously imposes topdown mandates or promotes the constant 
demonization of corporations and financial services. Shortsighted and misguided policies 
often sound good politically but usually have 
unintended consequences that frequently hurt 
the very people those policies are trying to help. 
Healthy financial systems are the lifeblood of a 
healthy economy. You only need to look at many 
countries around the world to see the damage 
done to their economy by misguided financial 
policies and regulations. I’d like to suggest a few 
ways we can make our regulatory system better 
for all Americans. 
We need to improve bank regulations. 
It is a completely false narrative that there has 
been any type of looser regulation on the largest 
banks since the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform 
and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) was 
passed. Capital requirements and other regulations have been on a relentless march upward 
even as banks have become proportionally 
A COMPENDIUM OF CRITICAL DOMESTIC POLICIES TO DRIVE GROWTH, OPPORTUNITY AND WELL-BEING

smaller within the financial system (see chart 
above). All of this makes banking and banking 
services (loans) not only more expensive but 
less available; these costs eventually will be 
passed on to the consumer and businesses and 
result in a slower-growing economy. 
Dodd-Frank did do some good things, mostly 
by improving capital and liquidity requirements 
and by creating resolution mechanisms for 
failed investment banks. But even for the regulators, Dodd-Frank set up a balkanized and dysfunctional regulatory system with too many 
cooks in the kitchen. This is hard for the regulators as well as the banks – not only does it result 
in excessive and duplicative regulations, but it 
also makes it more difficult for regulators to be 
responsive and nimble in a rapidly changing 
environment. You might ask why has it taken 10 
years to finish Basel III? 
The enormous rules and regulations by multiple 
regulators that make up the Comprehensive 
Capital and Analysis Review (CCAR) stress test 
and examination are tens of thousands of pages 
long; our most recent Resolution and Recovery 
plan was 80,000 pages long; and the regulations around global systemically important 
banks (G-SIB), liquidity, trading and operational 
risk have proved to be absurd and even harmful. 
Many of the tests we are required to perform are 
not even remotely accurate in measuring true 
risk – and this causes distortions on how and 
when capital is allocated and creates large 
opportunities for unnecessary arbitrage.
The CCAR stress test, in particular, is highly 
flawed. While it essentially repeats the conditions during the great financial crisis, it does not 
take into account any of the structural improvements to regulations, underwriting and product 
offerings since then. The reported results of the 
test do not come close to anything that would 
actually happen if the hypothetical scenarios 
were to happen – they unfairly misled the true 
strength of the banks. The numbers are simply 
inaccurate. It would be far better to perform 
accurate testing, and then if the regulators 
wanted to add conservatism on top of that, they 
should do so prudently and transparently. I have 
mentioned many times before that we conduct 
hundreds of stress tests a week to protect ourselves from a wide range of possible bad outcomes – not just the CCAR scenarios. 
The supplementary leverage ratio and G-SIB 
capital rules also treat U.S. Treasury securities 
and repurchase agreements as far riskier than 
they actually are. And the liquidity coverage 
ratio treats all other securities and loans as 
riskier than they are. These rules effectively discourage banks from acting as intermediaries in 
the financial markets – and this would be particularly painful at precisely the wrong time: when 
markets get volatile. 
So now is a good time to go back and ask basic 
questions that should have been asked before 
and, in fact, were required to be asked by legislation: What is the cost/benefit of these rules, 
and what is the interplay between them? What 
do you want the expected outcome to be? For 
example, do you want mortgages and leveraged 
lending outside the banking system? Many of 
these rules incent capital and even companies

to be private as opposed to public. Financial 
risks have grown dramatically outside of the 
banking system, where there may not be the 
same liquidity or transparency. We have created 
large and sometimes leveraged arbitrage 
opportunities. Similar products now have completely different rules and requirements. The 
chart above shows the extraordinary growth in 
nonbank institutions and in private credit and 
private companies. Is this what we wanted?
Additionally, we have not adequately understood how the extensive changes that regulations had on loans and liquidity affected money 
supply and monetary policy and, therefore, the 
growth of the economy. Banks used to lend out 
nearly 100% of their deposits, and now they lend 
approximately 70%. Before the great financial 
crisis, banks had less than 15% of their assets 
held as liquid assets, and they now hold over 
30%. If that capital and liquidity, now sitting idle, 
could be put to better use driving the economy 
without creating additional risk, shouldn’t we do 
this? Again, what is the effect of all this, and is 
this what we wanted to achieve? 
I do believe if we take a proper re-look, we can 
create more liquidity in the system and more 
clarity in resolution, eliminate most bank runs 
and reduce the cost of any bank failure, increase 
the amount of credit while lowering its cost, simplify regulations and improve access to banking 
for the unbanked – all the while maintaining a 
safe and sound banking system. Shouldn’t those 
be our collective goals?
One final point: If all these rules ended up being 
properly modified, JPMorganChase would be in 
a position to extend, over time, hundreds of 
billions of dollars in extra lending annually. Many 
other banks would be in the same position.
A COMPENDIUM OF CRITICAL DOMESTIC POLICIES TO DRIVE GROWTH, OPPORTUNITY AND WELL-BEING

able that simplifies the investing process with 
favorable tax treatment. Account holders can 
deposit and withdraw funds at any time, and 
there is no capital gains tax – just an annual tax 
of 1% on the balance. This has dramatically 
increased investment by retail investors into the 
Swedish stock market. 
The decline of the defined benefit pension system was fueled by funding rules that can affect 
cash flow and sometimes credit ratings, along 
with accounting changes for corporate plans 
that can create huge volatility in a company’s 
earnings and balance sheet. America’s critically 
important retirement policy should not have 
been undermined by accounting rules. For the 
defined benefit pension system to remain a viable component of our retirement system, we 
should return to a model that does not penalize 
pension funds for taking some investment risk. 
Guardrails are necessary: We need clear rules 
that ensure pensions are properly funded and 
transparent so that participants have confidence in the system and the burden isn’t transferred to taxpayers (roughly $70 billion has been 
paid to struggling defined benefit plans under 
the American Rescue Plan’s Special Financial 
Assistance program). A well-funded pension 
plan offers an investment-supported, tax-advantaged mechanism for employers to deliver 
retirement benefits cost-effectively. 
We need to encourage public markets.
Our public markets have been shrinking dramatically, which I do not believe is a good thing. The 
number of public companies has gone from 
7,300 in 1996 to 4,000 today – it should be 
15,000 today. This situation is the result, I 
believe, of a combination of factors: costly regulation and listing requirements; litigation; frivolous shareholder meetings; interference by 
non-governmental organizations; irresponsible, 
not-shareholder-friendly and misguided proxy 
advisors; lack of research for smaller companies; and cookie-cutter compliance requirements for boards, among others. 
We need to improve our retirement system. 
In 1980, 84% of our country’s private workforce 
had access to defined benefit plans versus 15% 
today. At present, 85% of the private workforce 
has access to defined contribution plans only, 
mostly 401(k)s. Defined benefit plans give individuals a known and guaranteed income that 
supplements their Social Security benefits, 
while employers invest the pension funds’ capital to generate long-term returns and manage 
asset-liability risk. 
Currently, many people are not prepared to deal 
with self-directed retirement plans, such as 
401(k)s: They don’t necessarily know how to 
invest the money; and they don’t know how long 
they will live in retirement. Defined benefit plans 
address these concerns by transferring the 
investment risks and the mortality risk from the 
individual to the company. 
Nonetheless, significant progress has been 
made to enhance the defined contribution system’s effectiveness for individual savers. Enrollment is now the default option while employer 
matching has become the norm, and professionally managed target date funds offer a simple age-based model of investing. A young 
worker today will have a much better chance of 
reaching a successful retirement outcome than 
previous generations. 
401(k) plans still have room for improvement. 
They should become more cost-effective and 
simpler to use for both employers and individuals. For example, 401(k)s should be portable 
when workers change jobs, and offered in a standardized form that can be used by multiple small 
businesses. Finally, and this is happening now, 
these plans should be designed with features that 
make them more like defined benefit plans. 
We can learn some valuable lessons from how 
other countries balance adequate contributions, 
professional investing, simplified structures and 
tax efficiency. Australia has an excellent retirement system in which employers effectively 
contribute 12% of ordinary pay into an account 
that is invested by professionals; the funds are 
available to the employee upon retirement. In 
Sweden, an investment savings account is availA COMPENDIUM OF CRITICAL DOMESTIC POLICIES TO DRIVE GROWTH, OPPORTUNITY AND WELL-BEING

Regulations should encourage, rather than discourage, companies to go public. We can 
achieve a more active market for small companies by allowing investment banks to sponsor 
smaller companies with research and market 
making. This could be accomplished by reducing the cost of listing, enacting tax policies that 
favor equity investment and allowing more flexibility in listing (e.g., dual voting, simpler disclosures, reduced proxy access, smaller boards). 
Litigation would need to be kept to a minimum to 
allow this to take place. Sweden is an example of 
a country with a thriving stock market due to 
reforms made along these lines. 
Finally, these changes would not only make it 
easier for companies to be public but would also 
improve capital access and create more innovation and, therefore, propel more economic 
growth. And great investments would be available to the average retail investor. 
LOCAL DEMOCRACY WORKS: LET IT 
SHINE AND LEARN FROM IT. 
In their book Our Towns, James and Deborah 
Fallows describe their visits to dozens of small 
cities and towns across America (the largest 
being Columbus, Ohio) in 2019 to see what was 
happening outside of major cities. What they 
learned was this: Local democracy works and is 
not nearly as polarizing as reported in major 
media outlets in big cities. Local businesses, 
mayors and civic societies work together to 
create jobs, improve schools and enhance their 
community’s quality of life (parks, river walks 
and other amenities). People generally collaborate, treat each other with respect and attack 
their local problems. Universities are often a 
critical part of this equation. What Mayor Mike 
Duggan did to turn Detroit around is an unbelievable example of what can be done in a major 
city. These cities fix their local problems: They 
experiment, they learn and they eventually win. 
Small democracy works – and we can learn a lot 
from it.

III. Specific Issues Facing Our 
Company
The last five years have been a period of significant growth for us – as evidence, we added 
more than 60,000 people to our workforce. 
While we have been very successful during this 
time, which was complicated by the pandemic, 
we allowed some bad habits to develop. Working 
from home exacerbated the situation by hindering innovation, slowing decision making, inhibiting information sharing, reducing efficiency, and 
creating more politics and bureaucracy. In the 
next section, Management Learnings, and in the 
letter by our Chief Operating Officer, we talk 
about various ways we seek to keep our company healthy and some specific efforts we are 
making to maintain our grit, our edge and our 
efficiency – all while keeping a keen sense that 
our competition around the world is always gaining. Here I outline how we are dealing with particular business challenges. 
WE TAKE A LONG VIEW IN DEALING 
WITH OUR EXCESS CAPITAL. 
Depending on what happens with all future regulations, we have somewhere between $30 billion to $60 billion in excess capital. While this is 
a nice problem to have, it does require some 
explanation on how we plan to deal with it. We 
aim to maintain a very secure dividend of 30% to 
35% of current earnings. When it comes to capital deployment, our first priority has always been 
to invest in organic growth – as growth with 
good returns is the greatest value driver. Our 
second priority would be to use that capital for 
acquisitions, but, for a variety of reasons, we find 
it hard to imagine a sufficiently compelling 
large-scale acquisition at this time. Our last priority would be to buy back stock. We believe 
that buying back stock should benefit ongoing 
shareholders rather than simply returning cash 
to exiting shareholders. Therefore, buying back 
stock, which might be a no-brainer at one times 
tangible book value, becomes a stretch above 
two times the tangible book value. This explains 
why our stock buyback program has not used 
up all of our capital generation and why our 
equity capital has grown. We are very patient, 
and don’t believe that there is any magic to the 
next 12 months, and, therefore, we look at 
excess capital as earnings in store or reserve – 
waiting to be used.
After reading the first section of this letter about 
the state of the world and the many risks facing 
the global economy, we hope you can see why 
we also believe that now is a good time to retain 
lots of extra capital and liquidity. 
WE BRING AN INVESTOR/OWNER 
MINDSET TO DRIVE ORGANIC GROWTH.
We are very fortunate to be able to drive organic 
growth in virtually every part of our company – 
and at healthy returns. Organic growth is hard, 
but it’s the best way to drive long-term, sustained 
shareholder value. You can read about many of 
these initiatives in the CEO letters of this Annual 
Report. Suffice it to say, organic growth involves 
adding bankers, branches, technology, products, 
services and countries virtually everywhere (we 
opened two new branch offices in Africa this year: 
in Kenya and Côte d’Ivoire). I had the privilege of 
visiting Kenya in 2024 with two of our senior 
executives who grew up there – it was quite moving to meet their families – both to see how 
important it is for Kenya to have JPMorganChase 
in their country and to see the great American 
story of how America can attract, train and 
develop great talent. You couldn’t help but be 
moved to see the pride on the mothers’ faces for 
their son’s and daughter’s achievements and the 
tears of joy in their eyes. 
The CEO letters cover our new affluent client 
drive following the acquisition of First Republic, 
new payment systems, enhanced development 
finance efforts, private credit and our huge new 
efforts around the growing Innovation Economy. 
Our great economies of scale allow us to invest 
and compete – with much of our growth driven 
by technology builds of new products and services. We are constantly assessing the landSPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY

scape and do expect lots of competition from 
existing competitors and fintech companies. We 
need to be as nimble as they are and use our 
skills and capabilities to stay ahead. 
OUR LARGEST RISK IS GEOPOLITICAL 
RISK. 
You have already read about the high and growing geopolitical and global economic risks. We 
constantly evaluate various potential outcomes 
(tabletop exercises) to ensure we can handle a 
range of scenarios. One of the largest risks we 
face is cyber attacks, both directly on our bank 
and on critical infrastructure; e.g., energy, communications. We also look at other potential 
large risks, such as war, hybrid and cyber warfare, energy disruptions and ongoing global 
threats, among other dangers. When we look at 
these various scenarios, we try to analyze and 
make sure we can handle not just the immediate 
effects on our company but also the secondary 
and tertiary impacts: effects on clients and 
potential dramatic repercussions on markets 
and the global economy. While we are not predicting or even expecting some of these terrible 
events, we believe that it is our job to be a source 
of strength, particularly in the toughest of times. 
WE’RE NOT IN KANSAS ANYMORE: 
ECONOMY, INFLATION, INTEREST 
RATES, ASSET PRICES, TRADE WARS, 
OH MY!
The United States has had a rather healthy 
and steady economy for years, although it 
was already weakening as I began writing this 
letter – and that was before the recent tariff 
announcement
The economy is facing considerable turbulence 
(including geopolitics), with the potential positives of tax reform and deregulation and the 
potential negatives of tariffs and “trade wars,” 
ongoing sticky inflation, high fiscal deficits and 
still rather high asset prices and volatility. 
Before I get into some of these issues, there is 
a really big “BUT” about what is considered 
America’s exceptional economic performance: 
Part of this performance has been driven by 
extraordinary deficit spending and the quantitative easing that took place. Since COVID-19, the 
federal government has borrowed and spent 
almost $11 trillion, and the Federal Reserve 
bought over $4.5 trillion in securities, creating 
huge liquidity in the financial system. Some of 
the results are exactly what you would expect: 
strong growth, inflation and higher corporate 
profits due to all the spending. But the U.S. deficit remains very large at just below $2 trillion, or 
6.6% of GDP, which is the highest peacetime 
level ever not driven by recessionary needs (as, 
for example, during the pandemic). This high 
U.S. deficit also is associated with large trade 
deficits and is happening while our debt-toGDP ratio is already over 100%, which is another 
peacetime high. The rest of the world has elevated debt levels and high fiscal deficits as well, 
although few as large as those of the United 
States. These large deficits are not sustainable 
– I do not know whether it will cause a real problem in six months or six years – the sooner we 
deal with it, the better. 
Tariffs and non-tariff barriers have always been 
hotly contested in trade negotiation. Non-tariff 
barriers come in many forms and have been 
growing over time (regulatory barriers, government procurement, export subsidies, food 
restrictions, etc.). Recently, value-added taxes 
(VAT) have entered this debate. Economists 
generally see VATs as a tax on domestic expenditures that does not discriminate on the source 
of spending. But since the VAT does not tax 
exports, some see them as a non-tariff trade 
barrier. In any event, their effect on trade may 
not be very large. 
Whatever you think of the legitimate reasons for 
the newly announced tariffs – and, of course, 
there are some – or the long-term effect, good 
or bad, there are likely to be important shortterm effects. As for the short-term, we are likely 
to see inflationary outcomes, not only on 
imported goods but on domestic prices, as 
input costs rise and demand increases on 
domestic products. How this plays out on different products will partially depend on their substitutability and price elasticity. Whether or not 
the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains 
in question, but it will slow down growth. 
SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY

There are many uncertainties surrounding the 
new tariff policy: the potential retaliatory 
actions, including on services, by other countries, the effect on confidence, the impact on 
investments and capital flows, the effect on 
corporate profits and the possible effect on the 
U.S. dollar. The quicker this issue is resolved, 
the better because some of the negative effects 
increase cumulatively over time and would be 
hard to reverse. In the short run, I see this as one 
large additional straw on the camel’s back.
I am hoping that after negotiations, the longterm effect will have some positive benefits for 
the United States. My most serious concern is 
how this will affect America’s long-term economic alliances, as I have written about in the 
first section. 
Our economy also faces the unknown effects of 
quantitative tightening – you must remember we 
have never had this much quantitative easing 
and, therefore, quantitative tightening before. 
This introduces another element of uncertainty, 
which, in my view – particularly in conjunction 
with the restrictions put on market making by 
primary dealers – will likely lead to much higher 
volatility in the treasury markets. This higher volatility is not necessarily bad for JPMorganChase, 
but it is not particularly good for the capital 
markets. Fortunately, there are many regulatory 
changes now being discussed that could ameliorate the situation. 
While inflation has come down, most of what I 
see in the future is inflationary: continued high 
fiscal deficits, the remilitarization of the world 
and the need for infrastructure investment, 
including the green economy and the restructuring of trade and tariffs. 
Another critical point: All these factors will 
impact interest rates. While the Federal Reserve 
essentially controls short-term interest rates, it 
does not effectively control 10-year interest 
rates. The Fed can take actions that can affect 
the 10-year interest rate in the short run, but, 
ultimately, the 10-year rate will be based upon 
inflation, the strength of the U.S. economy and 
expectations of the future value of the dollar, and 
the supply and global demand for long-term 
treasuries. All things being equal, the slower the 
growth, the lower the interest rates, and the 
higher the inflation, the higher the interest rates. 
This tug-of-war can go on for some time, but it’s 
good to remember that in the stagflation of the 
1970s, recessions did not stop the inexorable 
trend of rising rates. While interest rates have 
come down recently due to the weakening dollar, the risk off trade and the prospect of slower 
growth, this trend could still reverse. 
Moreover, it is worth noting that we enter this 
time of uncertainty with high equity and debt 
prices, even after the recent decline. No matter 
how you measure it, equity valuations are still 
well above their historical averages. And credit 
spreads are still near the low end of these same 
ranges. Markets still seem to be pricing assets 
with the assumption that we will continue to 
have a fairly soft landing. I am not so sure.
All of these cross currents and turbulence may 
take years to play out. It is almost impossible to 
confidently put them into a quarterly or even 
annual forecast. We always hope for the best, 
but we are prepared for a full range of outcomes 
– lower or higher rates and potentially lower 
asset prices, all of which could be driven by 
different factors, including inflation, recession, 
high capital demand, successful trade negotiations, regulatory and/or tax reform, or adverse 
effects from ongoing wars. Even with fairly 
extreme outcomes, our company would remain 
healthy.
Finally, I would like to close this section by reiterating that I still have an abiding faith in America 
– the exceptional strength of our innovative 
economy and our resiliency.
CONSUMER PAYMENTS HAVE BECOME 
A NEW BATTLEGROUND.
There is a lot of misunderstanding about the 
value and cost of a consumer checking account. 
Our consumer bank serves nearly 44 million 
customers and just over 60 million accounts. It 
costs approximately $225 for us to maintain an 
account, of which roughly $150 is a fixed 
expense. Included among these costs are all the 
branch expenses, the people expenses and the 
cost of onboarding accounts (including verifying 
customers’ identity and meeting Know Your 
Customer and anti-money laundering requirements). They do not include certain litigation 
costs or the cost of capital, which would add 
another $1.5 billion or essentially $25 per 
account. Our consumer accounts also come 
SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY

with an extraordinary number of services, generally free checking, free direct deposit, superior 
fraud protection, 24/7 access to call centers, 
access to cash from branches and ATMs nationwide, free investment accounts, free wealth 
planning, and free and safe payments, including 
debit cards, Zelle and more. 
Consumers “pay” for these accounts by the bank 
retaining net interest on deposits, which has 
averaged around 2.25% or approximately $275 
a year per account. However, for accounts with 
lower balances, which make up the majority of 
accounts, this is generally around $25 a year. 
Banks also receive certain fees, such as monthly 
account fees, overdraft fees and debit card fees, 
which on these accounts is usually around $100 
a year. For these lower balance accounts, our 
costs to maintain and operate them are far 
greater than what we make from them.
Debit revenue, which is paid by the third party 
receiving the payment rather than the consumer, was cut in half due to the ill-conceived 
Durbin Amendment (the average revenues from 
debit went from approximately $130 to $60 – 
this had been a large share of the revenues from 
smaller accounts). In setting the pricing for debit 
cards, the government looked only at the cost 
of the debit card swipe, which is illogical as that 
assumes a debit card is a separate and distinct 
product from its underlying checking account. 
Debit cards are a feature of the checking 
account that enable consumers to access their 
funds to pay merchants. Therefore, the true cost 
of providing debit cards should also include the 
costs associated with operating checking 
accounts (e.g., the costs of branches, bankers 
and so on). Predictably, to make up for their lost 
revenue, banks had to increase their fee schedules, causing approximately 1 million more individuals to become unbanked. The Durbin 
Amendment is the only case I can think of where 
the government determined the pricing between 
two big industries, in this case banks and 
retailers. 
Retailers now pay banks like ours that are subject to this government-mandated pricing 47 
basis points (0.47%), on average, for debit card 
transactions. This is far cheaper for retailers 
than debit card alternatives, such as cash and 
checks, while debit cards also provide retailers 
immediate guaranteed money and are preferred 
by consumers. All retailers bear a high cost of 
processing cash (including defalcation, cash 
sorting, delivery of cash to a bank, counterfeit 
funds and higher insurance because of robberies). The cost of processing cash, even for the 
largest retailers, is probably more than 4% of the 
payment. It is unfortunate that retailers and 
banks have been in a battle for years over who 
should bear the cost of processing money – and 
that retailers continue to use “lawfare” to get 
their way. This also makes it ironic that retailers 
are now adding “buy now-pay later” features as 
another payment option for their customers, 
which usually cost the retailer considerably 
more than processing a debit or even credit card 
transaction. 
Our Consumer Bank lost $500 million from fraud 
last year – $300 million from losses as a result of 
customer fraud committed on us (for example, 
counterfeit deposited checks) and $200 million 
from reimbursements to customers who were 
victims of fraud (it is our policy to reimburse 
100% of valid fraud claims). Unfortunately, we 
must also process thousands of scam claims 
where customers authorized transactions but 
should not have done so (for example, buying 
nonexistent products or sending money to fake 
websites), often because they were misled by 
bad actors. The loss rate to scams for our customers is amongst the lowest in the industry, 
and lower than nonbank payment providers. 
That is because we have made significant 
investments in fraud and scam detection, as well 
as prevention capabilities, and believe that our 
efforts have prevented Chase customers from 
losing $12 billion. Fraud and scams are a societal 
problem, and we need law enforcement, retailers, social media, telecom companies and others to work together to stop these crimes at the 
source. 
Now a new battle is brewing: Third parties want 
full access to banks’ customer data so they 
can exploit it for their own purposes and profits. 
Contrary to what you may read, we have no 
problem with data sharing but only if it is done 
properly: It must be authorized by the customer 
– the customer should know exactly what data is 
shared and when and how it is used; third parties should pay for accessing the banking system and payment rails; third parties should be 
restricted from using the customers’ data for 
SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY

purposes beyond what the customer authorized, 
and they should be liable for the risks they create when accessing and using that data. When 
banks utilize third party data, they will be, and in 
most cases already are, subject to these same 
obligations.
Banks provide fantastic services, and it’s time to 
defend ourselves – in the public realm or in 
court if need be. 
WE DEVOTE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES 
TO STRATEGIC INTELLIGENCE TO 
INFORM CHANGE AND SHARE OUR 
KNOWLEDGE. 
One of JPMorganChase’s roles in the global 
financial system is to educate ourselves and the 
world about companies, markets, countries and 
critical economic issues. With a team of over 
700 senior analysts, we perform extensive 
research on more than 5,000 companies and 
over 75 countries, spanning more than 20 specific sectors. Making ourselves, our clients and 
countries smarter, including about good public 
policy, has always been our goal. Doing this 
effort costs us over $1 billion a year. Given the 
importance of strategic intelligence, we have 
added a few critical elements, as follows:
• JPMorganChase Institute. Ten years ago, we 
created the JPMorganChase Institute to 
deliver unique data and insights to help solve 
some of our most pressing economic challenges. This information offers a unique lens 
into the financial habits of millions of small 
businesses and households, leveraging 
de-identified and aggregated customer data 
that represents half of U.S. households. The 
Institute’s data and analyses have helped policymakers better understand the impact of 
decisions – ranging from student loan relief 
and targeted investments in underserved Chicago and Detroit neighborhoods to small 
business support and insights about how families manage income volatility and use their 
tax refunds. Importantly, the Institute has also 
helped shape some of our own products and 
employee benefits, including how we incentivize customers to save more money and 
reduce health insurance deductibles for our 
lower-paid employees.
• JPMorganChase PolicyCenter. Five years 
ago, we launched the JPMorganChase PolicyCenter to distill what we’ve learned through 
the firm’s business resources and expertise, 
including Institute research and data, talent 
and philanthropic investments, into actionable, evidence-based policy recommendations. Grounded in data, we develop and 
promote policy aimed at reducing structural 
barriers to economic mobility and broadening 
opportunity for millions of families who live 
on the financial margins. We’ve conducted 
thought leadership and advocacy on issues 
such as housing affordability, workforce 
development and small business growth. 
• Asia Pacific Policy and Strategic Competitiveness. A year ago, we created a new role – 
Head of Asia Pacific Policy and Strategic 
Competitiveness – to lead an effort to bring 
together colleagues across the firm in examining key policy issues critical to our competitiveness, including trade and investment, 
supply chains, technology and infrastructure. 
We also maintain a strategic security forum 
focused on horizon scanning for emerging 
and evolving risks, such as societal polarization, nuclear and biological threats, cybersecurity and strategic competition in the Arctic, 
to name just a few.
• JPMorganChase Center for Geopolitics. We 
are creating a new group that builds on our 
firm’s long tradition of integrity, reliability 
and fortitude, offering forward-looking perspectives and unparalleled expertise. The 
JPMorganChase Center for Geopolitics will 
harness the firm’s vast network of knowledge 
and know-how to help clients successfully 
seize opportunities and weather the trends 
transforming the global landscape.

• Morgan Health. Back in 2021, we launched 
Morgan Health, a new division with an aim to 
deliver and scale new healthcare models that 
improve the quality, affordability and equity of 
employer-sponsored healthcare. The team is 
broadly focused on improving the U.S. healthcare system. In its first three years, Morgan 
Health has invested $217 million in nine healthcare companies. These investments have 
focused on advanced primary care and care 
navigation (Centivo, Mosaic Health and Personify Health), data analytics (Embold Health 
and Merative), specialty (Cortica and Kindbody), new coverage options for small- and 
mid-sized businesses (Venteur) and at-home 
care (LetsGetChecked). In addition, Morgan 
Health works closely with the JPMorganChase 
Benefits team to better meet the needs of our 
U.S.-based population, where 285,000 lives 
are covered in the United States. The Morgan 
Health team is addressing health disparities, 
publishing novel research, sharing insights 
with other employers and engaging policymakers. The team is making progress, but considerable work remains. 
• Localized Investments. After watching 
Detroit’s extraordinary recovery from bankruptcy, we replicated how we supported that 
turnaround to develop a model for large-scale 
investments to other cities around the world. 
From San Francisco to Paris to Greater Washington, D.C., we’ve applied what we learned in 
Detroit to communities where conditions are 
opportune for success and require deeper 
investments – where community, civic and 
business leaders have come together to solve 
problems and get results. For us, Detroit 
was an incubator for developing models that 
help us hone how we deploy our business 
resources, philanthropic capital, skilled volunteerism, and low-cost loans and equity investments. Some of these specific initiatives 
include: our virtual call centers that launched 
in Detroit and Baltimore; our senior business 
consultants who help entrepreneurs and small 
businesses make the transition from community lending to accessing capital from traditional financial institutions; our 19 Community 
Centers/branches that are often located in 
areas with larger Black, Hispanic or Latino 
populations; and our work skills development 
efforts around the country. In addition, our 
Affordable Housing Preservation program, 
established in 2021, has extended loans of 
$20 billion to incentivize the preservation of 
over 190,000 affordable housing rental units 
across the United States. Along those same 
lines, we expanded our $5,000 Chase Homebuyer Grant program to include more than 
15,000 majority Black, Hispanic and Latino 
communities (where the grant is available to 
all) and increased our grant amount to $7,500 
in select markets. Since our grant program 
began in 2021, we have provided about 14,000 
grants totaling $82 million.

national research university located in Fort Worth 
with more than 13,000 undergraduate and graduate students.
 – We bank Parkland Health, which is the oldest and 
only safety net hospital in Dallas. 
Our support to investment, corporate and middlemarket banking clients:
• Since 2019, we have provided in excess of $814 billion 
in credit and capital to local clients, such as oil and 
gas, technology, and media and telecommunications 
companies. For example:
 – JPMorganChase has been a steadfast banking 
partner to Fort Worth-based Double Eagle Energy, 
supporting the company’s growth and resilience 
through challenging times, including the 2016 and 
2020 commodity price crashes. With our support, 
it is executing 10,000 transactions totaling $15 
billion, benefiting individual landowners across 
more than 1 million acres.
JPMorganChase has helped to drive economic prosperity, job creation and business growth in Texas for more 
than 155 years. In 2023, we contributed over 
$1 billion to the Texas economy through goods and services purchased. With over 31,500 employees in the 
state – the highest number by state in the country – we 
bank businesses of all sizes, as well as schools, grocery 
stores, hospitals, government institutions and nonprofits. From Dallas to Austin to Houston to El Paso, we have 
the largest market share of Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation deposits in the state. We’re helping millions 
of clients, including over 8.5 
million consumer banking customers, 775,000+ small 
business clients, and government and community leaders thrive and achieve their goals.
We also know Texas is a great place to do business 
that values the power of free enterprise and partnership 
across sectors. We have shown up for Texans in good 
times and bad, and we will continue to do what it takes 
to keep growing. From creating or preserving 7,000+ 
affordable housing units since 2020 and helping large 
energy clients to supporting local community colleges, 
we’re continually exploring ways to help create jobs and 
develop business and policy solutions to drive growth. 
Our work with traditional and new energy technologies is 
a great example of how we help empower industry leaders in the state. We provided more than $219 billion in 
credit and capital to energy companies headquartered in 
Texas between 2019 and 2024, helping support affordable, reliable energy that bolsters American energy 
independence, energy security and economic growth.

 – For example, in North Texas, we helped Farmhouse 
Fresh grow into an international luxury skincare 
brand with $50 million in annual sales at retail value 
and almost 80 employees. The company’s origins 
began when the founder opened a business banking account 20 years ago at her local Chase 
branch. 
Our support to consumer banking needs:
• We support more than 8.5 million consumer banking 
customers with mortgages, auto loans, and savings, 
checking and credit card accounts.

SPECIFIC ISSUES FACING OUR COMPANY

At a recent annual senior leadership conference, 
I led a type of “master class” focused on management lessons for 400 of our top executives. 
I held this session because we cannot afford to 
be complacent if we want to continue as one of 
the great companies in the world. Leadership 
should always be about learning and questioning. Our company needs to nurture innovation, 
ambition and discipline while discouraging complacency, arrogance and bureaucracy. Here is a 
slightly streamlined (I did speak for 90 minutes) 
and edited version (to protect clients, former 
colleagues … and myself!) of my actual remarks 
to our team:
Welcome, everybody. I have a lot to say, and I’ve 
tried to organize it thoughtfully and intelligently. 
I just want to start with: What a great company! 
I don’t know about you, but when I see this company in action, it just blows me away. The quality 
of the people, the respect of our clients, and how 
much they want us in cities and countries around 
the world – it’s extraordinary. That’s based on the 
things that you do and how you do them.
WHY COMPLACENCY, ARROGANCE, 
BUREAUCRACY AND BS KILL 
COMPANIES. 
Part of what I’m always asking is: How do we 
make sure we stay innovative, ambitious and 
disciplined while eliminating complacency, 
arrogance and bureaucracy? 
So let’s look at a bunch of things. None of this is 
out of anger; it’s just thoughtful consideration 
about reinforcing some basic disciplines. 
You know, if you already have 100 people on 
your team, can you live with 100 people – or 
fewer – and make that work? This is very important. Everyone in this room, I’m talking to you personally. When I give examples, don’t say that 
applies to someone else: “That’s not my unit. 
That doesn’t affect me.”
IV. Management Learnings
It does, and I’m going to tell you why. Because all 
of you are responsible for this company that’s 
worth around $700 billion, employs 320,000 
people and serves so many, including all the clients you’ve seen who depend on you around the 
world. You, individually, are responsible. And you 
know more than you think. When you travel 
around, when you talk to people and when you 
manage what you do means that you know more 
than you think.
As you know, we’ve been asking people to 
achieve a 10% efficiency target. Again, it’s a discipline in business. Think about what you yourself can do to make things better. This is basic 
business: Can you do more with less? What are 
your units doing that can be streamlined? Or 
maybe you are doing things you don’t need to 
be doing at all.
I apologize, when I’m being specific, if it’s you I’m 
talking about. I’ve just got to get some things off 
my chest about what we need to do and some of 
the things I’ve seen recently or over my career. 
I’m going to ask each and every one of you, 
personally – and I’m going to track it – to send 
me an email. We’re going to have a little team to 
take these issues you raise and follow up, and 
this will be permanent. I kind of like bureaucracy 
busting to get things done. It could be stupid 
things you’ve observed, any ideas, almost anything. We’re not trying to limit you to any specific 
category.
You’ve got something to say? You want to add 
something? You want to check out something? 
You think something doesn’t make sense? 
Please bring it up. Too many people stay in their 
lane. I’m going to follow up personally with each 
and every one of you in this room. I’m just asking 
you to sit down and have a little fun thinking 
about the stupid stuff we do, the bureaucratic 
stuff we do – about things you would change if 
you were able to change them – and you all can 
be very helpful. I think we should all be thinking 
about this.
MANAGEMENT LEARNINGS

I’ve said speed kills, but I mean slow speed. 
I didn’t mean fast speed. And I’ve written down 
some examples of winners and losers from just 
the last 20 or 30 years that didn’t adapt. 
Sears and Kmart, they’re gone. Digital Equipment: Gone. A&P, the best supermarket in the 
world, disappeared – overtaken by Kroger. BlackBerry practically disappeared, too. Walmart’s 
done well. Dell did well, Apple obviously has done 
well, and Amazon has done well. Remember 
when everyone used to have Nokia phones? 
It’s even worse in financial services, where 
companies can manipulate numbers and overleverage and stuff like that. Travelers blew up, 
Citi blew up twice. Bear Stearns failed. Lehman 
failed. And Bank One – I’m here because, you 
know, Bank One screwed up a bunch of businesses. The S&L business – the whole business 
– got wiped out. The whole thing. Savings and 
loans do not exist anymore. WaMu’s mortgage 
losses. Whole parts of the mortgage business 
disappeared, and mortgage brokers disappeared. Kidder disappeared. Drexel disappeared. 
And then more recently, Silicon Valley Bank’s 
interest rate mismatch.
Of those that failed, many failed out of complacency, and complacency is a form of bureaucracy. It’s arrogance – it’s being slow to adjust. 
Complacency allows a lot of negative things to 
set in: dishonest numbers, failure to set standards, bad people, bad compensation schemes, 
disincentives, bad incentives, politics – and 
these things are all the cancers that kill companies. We all have to be very cautious when we 
see this happening. 
And things are faster and more complex now. 
That means we’ve got to move quicker, coordinate better and do things at a faster speed.
YOU HAVE TO GET THE NUMBERS 
RIGHT.
I’m a fanatic about proper accounting. Accounting can lead you to the wrong answer. Regulatory rules can lead you to the wrong answer. 
Regulatory capital can lead you to the wrong 
answer. Or your own echo chamber can steer 
you the wrong way. Still, you need to know your 
numbers: You need to get your numbers right, 
understand them, analyze them, work them, test 
them and don’t be rote about it. 
McKinsey used strategic business units as a 
way of segmenting businesses. Always remember that when you have big companies, it’s 
important to break them down to look at the 
component parts because the game is fought 
in the specific units. It’s fought in commercial 
card. It’s fought in premier card. It’s fought in 
branch banking. It’s fought in small business. 
However, it’s not fought in the consumer franchise as a whole.
You must have an actual budget as your 
barometer. For example, you can’t always compare yourself with the forecast because then 
you’re always very close. You’ve got to show 
any deficits or progress against the budget. 
Another thing I hate is comparing yourself with 
the peer average. I mean, really? You should 
always compare yourself with the best. Where 
are they, and where are we? Remember that the 
peer average includes some really crummy 
companies, too. 
You have to – we have to – always understand 
that a rigorous review of allocated expenses is 
needed. They are real expenses, but you have 
the right to question them. You have to question them because seeing through the BS that 
gets involved in allocating expenses – and then 
causes misallocation of capital – is really 
critical. 
Zero-based budgeting. I don’t like asking people to do it. It’s too hard. But you’ve got to think 
that way. For instance, if I start with 100 people 
doing the same thing, what do I do differently, 
better, more with the same number of people? 
Understand that a P&L is not an assessment of 
a business – you’ve got to do the full assessment with customer metrics, turnover, apps, 
technology ... whatever matters. In fact, the P&L 
could be the most deceptive thing of all – telling you and giving the wrong answer.
Project reporting. Whenever you have a project, and this is on you, it’s important to do 
proper reporting. It could be technology cost, 
it could be anything. I remember coming to 
J.P. Morgan and, one after another, every project was on course – but from the last forecast. 
I said, “Show me where it is from the beginning,” and now every single project was a year 
or two late. It’s just an honest assessment – not 
MANAGEMENT LEARNINGS

to blame yourself or get mad about it. Also, the 
project often morphed without any discussion. 
And I think that’s just bad management.
External reporting. External reporting actually 
matters. So I’m always quite careful. Reporting 
externally is real, but for a lot of companies, it’s 
not – they sugarcoat, they make it obscure. And 
what happens inside those companies is people 
start running their businesses that way. You’ve 
never seen me spin analysts. That’s because if 
I spin analysts, you’re going to spin me. That’s it. 
You know, I want to honestly show how we compare with competitors. 
Honest analysis. In your financial analysis, 
always evaluate the good, the bad, the ugly. That 
will make you better. Doing just the good makes 
you worse. Doing the good, the bad and the ugly 
makes you get better versus the competition. 
Constant investment. You know, the practice of 
stop-starting investments is a bad idea. Constant 
transformation in technology and conversions 
means you can’t have stop-start strategies 
almost anywhere. Make proper assumptions: 
What do you do when your spread on deposits is 
zero, but you’re still opening branches? That’s 
why I always talk about “through-the-cycle” 
investments. Think very carefully about the 
assumptions that go into your budgets because, 
sometimes, they cause you to do stupid stuff, and 
sometimes they stop you from doing good stuff.
Watching competitors. This involves comparing 
yourself with what the competition is doing 
today. But you always need to show how you’re 
going to catch up to where things might go. 
You’ve got to say, “What are the competitors 
going to do next?” because that shows when 
you’re getting to the puck and where the puck is 
going to be – not where things currently stand. 
Good expenses/bad revenue. Sometimes great 
expenses become great investments. The fact 
that it’s something called an expense means 
nothing to me. In fact, a lot of businesses capitalize these expenses. You build a plant, you 
capitalize it. You don’t start expensing it until it’s 
producing. But when we open a branch, many of 
the costs are not capitalized. We have a large 
cash outflow to build it, but after approximately 
four years when it breaks even, it generates 
profit for eternity. This is also true for private 
bankers, investment bankers, Chase wealth 
managers – our investment in them pays off 
over time.
In all that we do to grow and innovate, we must 
do the full analysis – as I’ve said, “the good, the 
bad, the ugly.” This makes us better. Looking at 
only the positives is dangerous. We all know 
there are good revenues and bad revenues, 
good expenses and bad expenses. We can make 
a big loan and book lots of revenue in the short 
term, but those will turn out to be bad revenues 
if we didn’t do the proper analysis at the beginning. The same reasoning applies to expenses. 
I hate the concept of cutting costs; instead, the 
concept should always be cutting waste. If costs 
are investments that drive healthy growth, then 
I want more of them.
Expense allocations. I’ve got a heritage JPMorganChase example. The company used to be 
dominated by the investment bank – because 
the people on the executive floor cared mostly 
about the investment bank. Everything was 
skewed toward the investment bank. They took 
HR costs, including pension, medical, executive 
comp, expats – all these costs lumped together 
– and they charged them out based on headcount across the company, which was not accurate. Expats were 100% in the investment bank. 
Executive comp was 100% in the investment 
bank, but their expenses were spread across the 
whole company. We subsidized capital for the 
trading floors. In all, subsidizing the investment 
bank cost $2 billion a year, which I immediately 
fixed. This was not to punish anyone, but it was a 
huge misallocation of capital. The big loser in all 
this was the consumer bank, and I’m still quite 
sensitive about that. 
Here’s another example: Capacity in the computer center was charged out to everybody, 
whereas the extra capacity, which is quite 
expensive, was required for only certain businesses but not others. It is not a waste of time to 
get expense allocation right. You may spend no 
time on it, but you shouldn’t be paying for capacity. We need payment systems to be paid for by 
the payment businesses. It’s important to be 
vigilant when you analyze expenses because 
things always morph, always go bad. Don’t 
assume allocations are okay. Businesses sometimes get credit for things they shouldn’t get 
paid for, and they don’t mention it.
MANAGEMENT LEARNINGS

I’ll just give you another example. When I got to 
JPMorganChase, we paid the treasury salesforce based on estimated revenue going forward. That was it. And almost no adjustments 
later on. It was staggering. 
Investing in branches. When I became CEO, 
Bank One hadn’t opened a branch in five years. 
Chase hadn’t opened a branch in five years. 
Chase had barely refurbished its branches, but 
at least Bank One did. By the time we did the 
merger, Bank One was making $1 million-plus 
profit on each branch every year: 2,300 
branches. Chase was making zero, partially 
because of its allocation practices and partially 
because no one seemed to care about them.
But these branches should have been hugely 
profitable. We don’t give a branch credit for 
credit cards when they create a credit card 
account that’s worth $600, even though 
branches create 1.5 million credit card accounts 
a year. That’s $900 million of value.
We do this NPV (net present value) analysis 
about why we should close a branch, and we 
should do this. We should be disciplined. I think, 
for the most part, NPVs might work, but they 
don’t always work. You need to use your common sense.
Sometimes banks will say they’re going to close 
a branch because it’s kind of small. This happened to me recently with our Old Greenwich 
branch. They were going to close it, and I just 
looked at some of the numbers ... and I went 
numb. It was making approximately $500,000, 
all profit, the NPV. And it’s six miles to the next 
closest branch. I said, if you close that branch, 
you know what’s going to happen? Eighty percent of the revenues will move elsewhere – to the 
Wells Fargo down the street, along with most of 
the local small businesses. Now would you rather 
have $500,000 a year profit or $1 million in cash 
in your pocket? I’d rather keep the $500,000 
annually. Who’s going to open in the same spot? 
One of our competitors: Wells Fargo, Bank of 
America or Citizens. And why does someone 
want to drive six miles in the winter on those icy 
roads? And is the branch more profitable than it 
looks? And to me, this wasn’t thinking about the 
NPV; it was the pawn blocking the queen. 
Judgment calls. Well, while we’re talking about 
cutting costs, I also did something unusual in 
2008: I opened the partners’ dining room. This is 
just how I think about what you should do, and 
what you shouldn’t do. You do the right thing 
anyway, whether it looks good or bad. The whole 
Operating Committee said, “Don’t do it. The 
partners’ dining room is going to cost a lot, and 
it will look like we are spoiling ourselves with 
good food.” And I was like, “Yeah, but we don’t 
actually know each other after the merger – and 
if we don’t do it now, it’ll be years before we get 
to know each other.” I call it a good expense. It’s 
a judgment call. You do the right thing and then 
explain it. Sometimes people don’t do things 
because they think it’ll look bad for them or hurt 
morale a little bit. When I got to Bank One, I 
authorized a partners’ dining room, and I did this 
at J.P. Morgan, too. 
YOU NEED A FULL AND CONSTANT 
ASSESSMENT. 
We can learn so much from our competitors, 
customers and employees if we only open our 
eyes and ears. I want a full and constant assessment of our competition, including many organizations outside of financial services. We always 
need to look and learn, assess and evaluate – 
stringently monitoring market trends and 
engaging with whoever does something better 
than us. Visit other companies, see their 
branches. Go on road trips with your people. 
Take your management teams to dinner. When 
you talk with clients and they tell you that you’re 
making a mistake, thank them. It’s a gift. And if 
the issue is not in your area, write it down and 
send it to the person who’s responsible. Get out 
of your own echo chamber. Hit the road, leave 
your office and talk with everyone you can – be 
constantly learning and assessing. Don’t be 
afraid to admit if you’ve made a mistake or were 
late to the game on something. It’s okay to be a 
fast follower. Just do a postmortem and identify 
what you’d do differently next time.
I mentioned learning from those outside our 
industry. Take Chick-fil-A as an example. I read 
they’re using drones to figure out how to move 
people through the drive-thru line faster. We 
should always have that mindset of making 
something easier for our customers. 
MANAGEMENT LEARNINGS

Ten years ago I said, “I’d like our senior team 
from the consumer bank to go to China.” I wish 
I had done more things like that sooner. This 
goes back to why it’s important to get on the 
road – to really understand your business and 
the competition. The team didn’t really want to 
go, but they did go, and they got to see Alibaba, Ping An and Tencent in action. And it 
changed the way they thought about digital 
banking, biometrics, super apps and other 
technology advancements. It’s amazing what 
you learn on the road. 
YOU BETTER HAVE GREAT 
CONTROLS. 
Honest numbers are critical to having great 
controls. Make a practice of continually 
reviewing financial operational detail, project 
reporting and audit reports. It’s a discipline 
like exercising – it should be frequent and rigorous. And little things can add up to big 
things. 
Back in the Primerica days, I bought one of 
those big Xerox copy machines for 2 million 
bucks. I’m down in Primerica’s printing plant, 
and the guy there showed me his Xerox copy 
machine, and I said, “Great, I just bought one 
of these.” He asked, “How much did you pay 
for it?” I said, “Two million dollars. How much 
did you pay?” He said, “Fifty thousand dollars.” 
You know why? He bought it from a bankrupt 
company. It was still in the box. That’s all. Let’s 
do that a little bit every now and then. 
Additionally, in terms of risk management, 
always examine new products and new credit 
underwriting standards. New products often 
tend to blow up. That happened with foreign 
exchange, with mortgage-backed securities, 
with swaps, derivatives, credit default swaps 
and others. Often, these new products have 
not been fully tested and haven’t been used 
over a long enough period of time. I’m also a 
fanatic about stress testing, which they 
quickly learned at J.P. Morgan when I first got 
there. In their scenarios, they were looking at 
equity markets down 10% and credit spreads 
gapping out 40%. Was that sufficient? No! 
I said let’s look at what would happen if equity 
markets were down 50%, high yield went to 
20% and credit spreads gapped out to the 
worst ever. That is real stress testing and risk 
management. 
YOU MUST KILL BUREAUCRACY ALL 
THE TIME AND RELENTLESSLY.
One of the biggest things that can kill a company 
– or make it slow to adjust or admit problems – is 
bureaucracy. It comes in a lot of forms, and you 
have to continuously weed that garden. It’s a 
mindset.
Take Home Depot: When you walk into the Home 
Depot global galactic headquarters, the sign 
above the main entrance says “Store Support 
Center.” It reminds corporate employees every 
day that they are there because they support the 
workers in stores around the country. And we 
have to remember – all of us, particularly corporate staff – that we are here because we have a 
customer, a branch or an investment banker in 
front of a client. That is an important mindset. 
Then you can use things like war rooms and 
review customer complaints to hone this 
thinking.
I always like to read customer complaints. I read 
them, and when I know the policy behind the 
complaint, I call up the people in charge and say, 
“I agree with the customer.” Sure, we “shoulda, 
coulda, woulda.” But I don’t give a damn whether 
we’re technically responsible or not. You’ve got 
to do the right thing; you’ve got to change your 
mindset.
Let’s take ATMs. When I got to Bank One, this 
situation happened. My wife called me from Walgreens. The Bank One ATM didn’t work. I tell the 
people on the ATM side of the bank, and a guy 
calls me back and says, “No, it’s working.” I say, 
“My wife called me and says it’s not working.” He 
replies, “No, it’s working.” So I say, “Do me a 
favor – get in your car and drive out there.” Then 
he drives out there – and it’s not working. As it 
turned out, we had an outside vendor tracking 
this stuff. So I told the guy that we were firing the 
vendor and wouldn’t pay him for the last six 
months. Now we track it ourselves. This stuff 
can happen all the time.
Then there’s the black car story. You all know the 
black car story never happened at J.P. Morgan. It 
did happen when we took over Shearson though. 
I was going outside one day, and there were, literally, 50 black cars. People were waiting to go 
home until 7 o’clock so they could take a black 
car home. They were supposed to take them to 
the closest train station. And they would pick up 
MANAGEMENT LEARNINGS

their dinner – no one paid attention to it. There 
was one woman who took a car to Glen Cove or 
somewhere and back every day. She came in 
early in the morning. I went back to her boss, 
who knew about it. And I said to the boss, “You 
know, I can get her a full-time car and driver for 
one-third the cost.” And I changed a bunch of 
rules and stuff like that.
Some years ago, all our branches were receiving 
tons of stuff, daily and weekly, from Corporate – 
from HR, Risk, Legal, Compliance, Trading, 
Audit, Finance – they were overwhelmed. I used 
to go to branches, and they’d complain about 
things they didn’t know about. I said, “We sent 
you a memo that was full of information.” And 
one of the men in the branch showed me a 
FedEx box, the really big one, and dropped it in 
front of me. He said, “This box is what we get 
every week from you guys.” He had no idea 
about all the stuff that was in it. So we just 
changed things up a bit, using common sense, 
and created a little booklet called, I think, “Since 
We Last Met” or “You Must Read This.” It had a 
summary page and listed the important stuff 
people needed to know. Little things like this are 
important to get right.
It’s important for leadership to always question 
what their company does and why. And the 
answer cannot be, “That’s the way we’ve always 
done it.” Lots of times bad habits form and 
people get lazy, take shortcuts or don’t care 
enough. A good example is from when I came 
to JPMorganChase more than 20 years ago. 
I was told we had 500 management coaches. 
I said, “Five hundred coaches? Really?” Our 
Operating Committee was slightly annoyed by 
my question and wondered whether I was going 
to micromanage every single decision. Of 
course I said that I wasn’t – and that it was their 
decision – but the issue really bothered me. I 
thought about it over the weekend, and on 
Monday I told the Operating Committee, “You 
know what? I changed my mind. I’m going to 
micromanage this one. I want all coaches out 
by the end of the week.” I didn’t take that step 
to save money. I did it because it’s a leader’s job 
to coach, and we basically had outsourced 
management! I told the committee they could 
bring back a coach at the end of one year if 
they truly thought it was necessary and if they 
personally vouched for the coach’s capabilities. 
But in my entire career, I’ve rarely seen this kind 
of outsourcing of responsibility succeed. 
Here’s another example of what slows us down: 
meetings. Kill meetings. But when they do happen, they have to start on time and end on time 
– and someone’s got to lead them. There should 
also be a purpose to every meeting and always a 
follow-up list. Sometimes we think we’re just 
being nice by inviting people to a meeting who 
don’t have to be there. Sometimes we overcollaborate. One annoying example of bureaucracy 
is the meeting after the meeting, where an executive tells me what they didn’t want to say in 
front of their partners. That’s not acceptable. 
Don’t bother. I’m not their messenger. Lay it on 
the table in real time. Shine light on a problem or 
disagreement. Be transparent with your colleagues. Obviously, it’s different if it involves a 
private matter, but, usually, this strategy is just a 
go-around, an end run. We cannot allow these 
kinds of behaviors.
MISTAKES I MADE.
I also recognize that I don’t always get everything 
right and that I have made plenty of mistakes 
myself, and that’s why I want to candidly share 
some of them – as lessons. It’s important that we 
all do that. For example, I underestimated the 
importance of cloud technology, I’ve sometimes 
left the wrong person in a job for too long and I 
failed to recognize some early signs of risk. 
In sharing these experiences, I always reflect on 
the anatomy of mistakes and emphasize the 
need to acknowledge and learn from them. 
Mistakes happened for a variety of reasons – 
we didn’t have the right people in the room, we 
didn’t work hard enough, we didn’t have a 
thoughtful decision-making process, we didn’t 
get the right inputs, we made bad assumptions. 
The London Whale, where we lost billions of 
dollars in 2012, is another mistake that’s good 
to reflect upon. The mistake there wasn’t the 
complexity of the portfolio; it was that it didn’t 
get the proper oversight, including from the 
firm’s risk committees. The idea emerged in a 
supposedly non-risky part of the bank, and the 
team overseeing the trades played it close to 
the vest and didn’t go through our normal risk 
controls. We didn’t realize that at the time, but 
MANAGEMENT LEARNINGS

we should have, and I had some signs looking 
back. Frustratingly, the traders wanted to avoid 
oversight because it was risky. This reminds me 
of another sin that promotes mistakes in companies – hoarding information, which is a disease.
And here is one of my big mistakes when I got to 
Bank One. I’d been there for not quite a year, and 
I was in Louisville, where our business had been 
shrinking. I was trying to fix all that. I was in a 
local branch, and I realized that the branch 
across the street’s hours were 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., 
and our hours were 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. I thought, 
whoa, that’s not so good. I called up our branch 
management, and they said, “Well, we’re different – we’re not that kind of bank.” I asked them 
to do me a favor: Let’s find out for all of our 
branches – we had about 1,800 at the time – 
what are our hours compared with the average 
competitor. And they said, “Well, how are we 
going to do that?” I said, “Well, email the other 
branch managers, and ask them for their hours 
of operation.” And, it turns out, we were open 
two hours fewer a day.
It was a Friday, and I went home a bit embarrassed. I came in on Monday, and it just so 
happened that the whole branch management 
team was there. And here’s what I said to them: 
“I apologize. I thought I was a pretty good CEO, 
but I messed up, I made a mistake. I should have 
recognized this much sooner.” However, not one 
salesperson, not one branch manager, not one 
regional manager, not one district manager 
noticed this or mentioned it. Now that I was 
aware of the issue, I told them all that we must 
change our hours. Morale was already bad, and 
everyone went on and on about morale because 
we had to change our work hours – and it was 
difficult and complicated. But I said, “We’ve got 
to change it. We’re here for customers. Obviously, I care about morale – but morale sucks 
because we suck. Morale will get better when 
we’re better as a company.” 
WHAT THE HECK IS CULTURE? 
What is culture anyway? I struggle with this one 
a little bit because I think it’s a lot of the things 
I’m speaking about here. A great culture is created by what you do and not by what you say. 
When we talk about the culture of our company, 
we include the hundreds of thousands of people 
who work for our company and what they believe 
in, as well as the role of our company in society. 
For those people, our employees, we work hard 
to foster an environment that enables them to 
thrive as curious, honest, hard-working and 
empathetic individuals who care not only about 
each other but about our customers as well – to 
be people who want to do the right thing – and 
it’s very important we get this right. Of course, 
there are good people and bad people, but I like 
to think we’re almost all good people. Similarly, 
there can be people you don’t trust: Sometimes 
you don’t trust them because they lie – or they 
shape the truth. Or you can’t trust them because 
you don’t trust their judgment. Watch out for 
them and don’t follow them.
Unfortunately, sometimes the bad people are 
our customers. I fire bad clients: corporate 
clients, individuals. There used to be a wealthy 
guy who would come into a branch yelling and 
screaming. He was verbally abusive to our staff 
multiple times. I finally heard about it and called 
him and said, “I want you to take all your business 
out of the bank. And by the way, you’re not going 
to treat our people that way.” If we have a client 
who is disrespectful to our people and the way 
we operate, we will fire them. And life will go on.
And recognition is important. Recognition says 
someone did something that you didn’t, that 
they taught you something. I was never particularly good at recognition. But I’ve learned lessons about recognition by watching “Ted Lasso” 
and observing David Novak, former CEO of Yum! 
Brands. They taught me that recognition is a 
form of humility and acknowledgment. And this 
directly aligns with our company’s values and, 
importantly, our actions. Organizations build a 
great culture by recognizing people’s actions 
day in and day out – not by serving up 
platitudes.
MANAGEMENT LEARNINGS

Creating a good culture is possible only if everyone understands a company’s purpose – in our 
case, the role of our bank. I think our purpose is 
to lift up society, to help people, which is an 
enormous responsibility. We have millions of 
customers, employees and shareholders who 
count on us. I think if you don’t share this vision, 
you don’t belong at our company.
And have a little heart. One example: Many years 
ago, when I was new to JPMorganChase, I 
learned that the company’s security guards had 
been outsourced – to save money. But after outsourcing, the same guards continued coming to 
work every day at the same salary, and I wondered, “How could this be?” (FYI, this was 
brought to my attention by the head of a large 
union, who came to see me personally over the 
objection of my management team.) The reason 
we were saving money was because the benefits 
were cut in half for the guards and their family 
members (currently worth more than $19,000 a 
year), and the savings were split with us. This was 
a heartless thing to do – and the second I found 
out, I reversed the decision. JPMorganChase’s 
success will not be built off the backs of our 
guards – it will be the result of fair treatment of all 
of our employees – and we’re thankful that many 
of those guards are still with our company today.
LEADING THE TEAM.
It’s very important to have regular business 
reviews and to attack problems by putting all the 
dead cats, the hard issues, on the table. Emphasize the negatives. Make it fun and foster a collaborative environment when you’re facing 
tough subjects. Share all the facts and recognize 
that disagreement is a good thing. 
Loyalty is earned when people receive full input 
and know that they’ve had a chance to offer 
theirs. Everyone should provide their input, 
review the facts and then make decisions – but 
not before that. Sometimes in meetings, colleagues urge others to “stay in your lane.” Absolutely do not stay in your lane! That is a bureaucratic, stupid direction. Our biggest mistakes 
happen when people think something is kind of 
a problem, but they are afraid to raise it in the 
right room where it might be provocative. 
There’s nothing wrong with disagreement. Ever. 
And make it fun. You know, it’s our job to have 
fun in life and make everything we do fun. Just 
do it all the time in your unit and ask others to do 
the same. 
For example, see mom and dad when you go on 
the road. When I went to Kenya this year, I invited 
two of our senior executives from Kenya who 
now work for our company in the United States 
to join me – and we invited their mothers to 
attend the client reception in Nairobi. It was 
quite moving to meet their families – what a gift 
to see what those women had accomplished 
with those wonderful kids. And moms and dads 
love to see us. Also, when you take the management teams to dinner, try to include their 
spouses. It’s a lot of fun, and you learn a lot 
about each other on the team. 
WHY IT’S HARD TO ACHIEVE GOOD 
GROWTH AND INNOVATE.
Testing and learning are important – there’s 
nothing that can’t be improved by testing and 
learning. You can kill innovation with too many 
resources, too few resources or bureaucracy, 
and you’ve got to really think through what you 
are trying to accomplish. Similarly, it’s important 
to evaluate innovative ideas through testing and 
learning rather than rote analysis, which can 
stifle creativity. Companies that want to foster 
growth through forward thinking need to nurture 
that effort and support innovation.
The conversions at both J.P. Morgan/Chase and 
Bank One are good examples. There was resistance to the integration, and the conversions 
were costly. They took time and different 
resources. But there were approximately seven 
loan systems, five deposit systems and 25 general ledgers that all needed to be consolidated 
to develop the best systems. You just do the 
tough stuff like this. And then what happens 
when you get these consolidations done is 
you make the company better at it over time. 
Transformation is a constant effort to improve.
In many cases, expansion is fought – and it’s 
most often fought from within the existing ranks. 
The current workforce is often resistant to grow 
the team because they think it’s going to come 
out of their compensation. That’s not right – 
the company pays for the additional bankers. 
MANAGEMENT LEARNINGS

I confronted this resistance years ago when we 
wanted to grow the Global Corporate Bank – 
again, there was pushback from our current 
bankers. I saw the same resistance from within 
when we were growing Chase Wealth Management. But we looked at how big the opportunity 
was in each of these cases to grow, expand and 
be able to compete more effectively. And each 
of these efforts has been a home run for us.
MANAGEMENT TRICKS AND TOOLS. 
Now I want to talk about some management 
tricks and tools. 
Effective leaders are responsive and treat everyone fairly and with respect. You have to be direct 
and honest, which is all about respect (though 
I recognize I get too worked up sometimes!). But 
I’m not only talking about bosses – I’m talking 
about people at every level. Treat everyone well, 
from clerks to CEOs, no matter who they are. 
While leaders should celebrate successes, it’s 
still important to emphasize the negatives and 
focus on continuous improvement. Be a skeptic 
but not a cynic. Utilize management techniques 
that work. 
I’m a big fan of this one: Write memos yourself. 
Don’t always let others write them for you. Similarly, when I ask someone a question, I want to 
hear directly back from that person, not their 
boss’s boss up the chain. And if I call that person 
directly, I want to talk to them. And share all the 
facts. Don’t hoard facts. The facts don’t lie. 
Another tip: Always make follow-up lists. I keep 
my own follow-up lists with me almost all the 
time. Regarding communications, avoid management pablum. It’s a pet peeve of mine. Talk 
like you speak – get rid of the jargon. 
And turning to meetings, if one is required, make 
it count. I ALWAYS do the pre-read. I give it 100% 
of my attention. I see people in meetings all the 
time who are getting notifications and personal 
texts or who are reading emails. This has to stop. 
It’s disrespectful. It wastes time. Finally, if you’re 
going to a meeting to present a new product or 
service, write a press release about it. This exercise forces you to answer lots of questions people are likely to ask. When you write down what 
you’re going to say, it focuses the mind and 
helps you explain things better.
Work smarter, not longer. Don’t read the same 
email two or three times. Most can be addressed 
immediately. And while this all sounds serious, 
make work fun. We spend the vast majority of 
our waking hours at work – it’s our job to try to 
make it fun and fulfilling. 
And another important one: Take care of 
yourself. If you don’t take care of yourself, 
it doesn’t work.
Last, always answer this question: “What would 
you do if you were queen or king for a day?” 
That’s the big one – what would you do? 
I’m going to stop here. Thank you for all the 
great things you said, for the great things you’ve 
done. And just so you know, while I may be saying this, I want to be self-critical, too. I’m awed by 
you all. Thank you for spending time with me.

MANAGEMENT LEARNINGS

In Closing
It’s been more than 20 years since the JPMorganChase-Bank One merger – and it’s been 
an extraordinary journey. I can’t even begin to express my heartfelt appreciation and 
respect for the tremendous character and capabilities of the management team that got 
us through the good times and the bad times to where we stand today. And I recognize 
that we all stand on the shoulders of many others who came before us in building this 
exceptional company of ours. 
A beautiful physical manifestation of our company is our new headquarters in New York City, 
which we look forward to opening later this year. It is a great example of how we treat our 
people with wonderful places to work – in New York City, across the country and around the 
world. Our new headquarters also shows how you can deconstruct something and rebuild it 
in a powerful way – that’s good for our colleagues, our clients and our community. 
I would also like to express my deep gratitude to the 300,000+ employees, and their 
families, of JPMorganChase. Through these annual letters, I hope shareholders and all 
readers have gained a deeper understanding of what it takes to be an “endgame winner” 
in a rapidly changing world. More important, I hope you are as proud of what we all have 
achieved – as a business, as a bank and as a community investor – as I am. Thank you for 
your partnership.
Finally, we sincerely hope to see the world on the path to peace and prosperity.

33 Percentage of active mutual fund and active exchange-traded funds (ETF) assets under management (AUM) in funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd 
quartile (one, three and five years): All quartile rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings are 
sourced from the fund rating providers. Quartile rankings are based on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where applicable, the fund 
rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on fund performance and associated peer 
rankings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, at a primary share class level to represent the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg 
and Hong Kong SAR funds, and at the fund level for all other funds. The performance data may have been different if all share classes had been

committed capital. AUM only for 2005. 2023 restated due to product reclassification.
37 Percentage of active mutual fund and active ETF AUM in funds rated 4- or 5-star: Mutual fund rating services rank funds based on their 
risk-adjusted performance over various periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and represents the top 10% of industrywide ranked funds. 
A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industrywide ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of industrywide ranked funds. 
A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industrywide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of 
industrywide ranked funds. An overall Morningstar rating is derived from a weighted average of the performance associated with a fund’s 
three-, five- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar rating metrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds, separate star ratings are provided at the individual 
share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of history 
are not rated and hence are excluded from these rankings. All ratings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive these 
rankings are sourced from the applicable fund rating provider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset values into 
U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds and at a primary share class level 
to represent the star rating of all other funds except for Japan, for which Nomura provides ratings at the fund level. The performance data may 
have been different if all share classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results.

FUTURE-PROOFING THE COMPANY AND OUR OPERATIONS

Future-Proofing the Company 
and Our Operations
JPMorganChase is a world-class 
institution. We operate in more than 
100 global markets, serve millions of 
customers and process nearly $10 
trillion daily through our wholesale 
payments business. Our footprint is as 
broad as the globe and as deep as the 
very personal, individual interactions 
our employees have each day with the 
governments, businesses, nonprofits, 
individuals and communities that 
we serve. 
In my new capacity as Chief Operating 
Officer for the firm, I have the 
responsibility and privilege of looking 
after critical operations that function 
as the foundation and engine for our 
employees to deliver excellence in 
financial services around the world 
each day. 
INVESTING IN THE 
TECHNOLOGY OF THE FUTURE
In addition to the day-to-day operations of the firm, I am focused on making certain that we are investing in our 
future. We are a technology-driven 
company as much as we are a bank, 
and technology is fundamental to 
everything that we do. 
We employ more than 60,000 technologists across the globe, and we’ve 
made remarkable strides modernizing 
our technology infrastructure and 
engineering practices. Our technology 
estate consists of more than 6,000 
applications and nearly an exabyte of 
data, with a multi-cloud strategy that 
enables us to continuously innovate our 
businesses. We have also been recognized as a leader in banking in frontier 
technologies like artificial intelligence 
(AI) and quantum computing research.
We know that investments we made in 
technology years ago are helping our 
business, products and services to 
be best-in-class today. Our software 
engineers are seeing up to 10-20% 
productivity in the software development life cycle through AI coding assistant tools, freeing them up to work on 
other tasks and projects. We also just 
achieved an industry milestone, the 
first successful demonstration of a 
novel quantum computing protocol to 
generate Certified Randomness, with 
industry-leading partners.
We’ll continue to invest in technology 
to ensure we are on the front lines of 
innovation and to set the company up 
for future success. 
We recognize that AI is not just a 
technological advancement but a transformative force that is reshaping the 
financial services landscape. In 2024, 
we launched our flagship generative AI 
product, LLM Suite, to more than 
200,000 of our colleagues around the 
world. LLM Suite enables employees to 
access leading GenAI capabilities on 
their desktop in a controlled environment that protects our customer and 
company data. In addition, it also 
enables businesses across the enterprise to develop use cases and to 
integrate GenAI more easily into their 
workflows by leveraging a shared set of 
capabilities available on the platform. 
While we have made substantial 
progress in our AI journey over the 
past decade, we are still in the early 
stages. As the technology continues 
to evolve to offer more reasoning and 
complex problem-solving capabilities, 
AI will play a critical part in helping us 
produce faster and better results 
for our business. 
INVESTING IN THE WORKFORCE 
OF TODAY AND TOMORROW
Our technology would be rudderless 
without the incredible people who run it. 
Our workforce reflects the very best 
and brightest talent from many different backgrounds and perspectives. 
We support career growth with competitive pay, comprehensive benefit 
packages and opportunities to develop 
new skills through training and education benefits. With our global footprint, 
thousands of open roles across a 
myriad of job types, and a mobility 
mindset, we offer a depth of incredible 
career possibilities that most companies simply cannot. 
We also recently made enhancements 
to our leading benefits based on 
employee feedback, including 
expanded parental and bereavement 
leave time, education reimbursement, 
special awards for employees on their 
savings plans, expanded matching 
contributions, decreased costs on 
medical plans, increased wellness 
benefits, mental health resources, 
special perks and discounts, and more.
Over the past two years, Human 
Resources (HR), Global Technology 
and our Chief Administrative Office 
have been working in partnership to 
reinvent the employee experience. 
We’re innovating across platforms and 
functions to deliver a more cohesive, 
frictionless, personalized experience 
for our employees, which in turn, helps 
them better serve our customers and 
clients. GenAI is helping us reimagine 
how teams collaborate and connect, 
driving greater efficiency and effectiveness and ultimately a better 
employee experience. 

FUTURE-PROOFING THE COMPANY AND OUR OPERATIONS
Simply put, JPMorganChase is a great 
place to work.
We believe that the office remains 
the primary place for people to work. 
It’s where we foster and deepen 
our great culture, collaboration and 
career mobility. 
We also recognize we need to continue 
to invest in the workplace of the future 
that delivers an elevated experience 
for employees, clients and visitors. 
That’s why we’re working to upgrade 
our global real estate portfolio, modernizing 125,000 seats with plans to 
deliver an incremental 75,000 additional new or modernized seats over 
the next five years. It’s also why we 
opened two new corporate centers in 
India, a technology center in Glasgow 
and renovated our Columbus headquarters, all completed within the last 
two years. Our strategy is focused on 
creating excellent workspaces that 
have more communal, collaborative 
and restorative areas, advanced environmental systems and best-in-class 
amenities. 
It’s also why we are so excited to cut 
the ribbon on our new headquarters 
building, a true architectural marvel. 
When complete, it will be New York 
City’s largest all-electric building 
totally powered by renewable energy, 
with net zero operational emissions. 
Special features include outdoor 
spaces, 30% more daylight and the 
capacity to support more than 50,000 
connected devices, including computers and mobile devices, making it the 
most connected, data-driven high-rise 
building in New York City.
When we invest in improving our real 
estate, not only are we investing in our 
employees – we’re investing in the 
local community. We are a major 
employer in local communities across 
the globe, with thousands of employees who significantly contribute to 
the local economy surrounding their 
workplace, stimulating additional jobs 
across local industries such as restaurants, coffee shops, dry cleaners, local 
retailers and gas stations. We recognize the critical role we play not only 
as a steward of the global financial 
system but also as a catalyst in boosting local economic health in the communities where we operate.
Our Guiding Principles Remain Unchanged: 
We seek to make dreams possible for everyone, everywhere, every day.
We do not believe that talent is concentrated in any particular demographic group(s) and are 
dedicated to equal employment opportunity for talent across all backgrounds. 
We strictly prohibit unlawful discrimination, harassment and abusive conduct of any kind. We are 
dedicated to treating all individuals fairly and with respect.
We seek to attract and retain the best talent. We recognize that our people are our strength and the 
diverse talents and perspectives they bring to our global workforce are directly linked to our success.
We strive to build and foster an inclusive work environment where our employees are respected, 
trusted and empowered. Our experience is that if our teams are more diverse, we will generate better 
ideas and outcomes, enjoy a stronger corporate culture and outperform our competitors.
We are dedicated – and in many places obligated – to supporting underserved communities as part 
of our commitment to corporate responsibility and long-term shareholder value. We strive to 
empower individuals and improve lives through our business practices and community outreach 
efforts that we have seen are good for customers, communities and our business. 

OUR PURPOSE AT WORK
Our Purpose is to make dreams possible for everyone, everywhere, every 
day. We bring that to life with passion 
and grit through every interaction we 
have with our colleagues, customers 
and clients.
Our business and people practices are 
all anchored to the correct governance 
and controls that hold us to account for 
the policies and processes we put in 
place. We have the highest standards of 
excellence and are constantly asking 
ourselves how we can get better. 
Part of that includes doing the right 
thing, upholding our code of conduct, 
and how we treat our customers and 
clients – never turning anyone away 
because of who they are or what they 
believe. This Purpose also extends to 
our treatment of our employees and to 
our belief that a culture where everyone 
is afforded respect and dignity creates 
the best workplace and business 
outcomes.
Indeed, we believe our strong culture 
is what makes us deliver so well for our 
shareholders, clients and customers, 
and that includes our belief in the 
power of a diverse workforce, which 
strengthens our business and builds 
trust within our communities. As I 
mentioned recently in a note to 
employees, our Diversity, Opportunity 
and Inclusion organization, along with 
the lines of business, HR and Corporate 
Responsibility, will continue our efforts 
to reach the most customers and 
clients to grow our business, uplift 
the people and communities we serve, 
and create an inclusive workplace for 
our employees. 
We will continuously evaluate programs 
across every part of our business to 
ensure they make commercial sense, 
are driving the right business outcomes 
and comply with current laws as they 
evolve. And we’ll stay true to our longstanding core principle and practice 
of reducing barriers because we know 
that talent and potential are equally 
distributed but that access and opportunity are not.
As a global company, we are dedicated 
to serving communities worldwide, 
from Baltimore and Huntsville to Paris 
and Hyderabad. Initiatives born from 
the model of our successful work in 
cities like Detroit to spur economic 
opportunity have led to innovation in 
products and services. Our offerings – 
including affordable housing and the 
expansion of branches, products and 
services in urban and rural areas – are 
now embedded in our everyday business and are, and always have been, 
available to all. Sometimes you start 
with a problem statement around a 
very particular issue or community, 
but the solutions benefit all. 
Our virtual call centers, first piloted in 
Detroit in 2022, have created more 
than 200 jobs. Since 2022 we have 
expanded to other cities, including 
Atlanta and Baltimore, where we 
recently welcomed a new cohort of 40 
employees who are military spouses. 
Hiring veterans is another win for 
everyone, and I’m proud to break 
the news here that the Veteran Jobs 
Mission, a coalition of more than 300 
companies that we helped to found in 
2011, just reached 1 million veterans 
hired. That includes nearly 20,000 
veterans hired within our firm. Removing 
barriers through these initiatives and 
others, like our second chance hiring 
and tapping different communities 
for the skills and expertise that they 
lend our business, has helped our firm 
to thrive.
Successful companies require thriving 
communities. It makes good business 
sense to invest in the broader 
ecosystem.
OUR VALUES 
Our Purpose is realized through living

FUTURE-PROOFING THE COMPANY AND OUR OPERATIONS

CONSUMER & COMMUNITY BANKING

Consumer & 
Community Banking
I’m very proud of how Consumer & 
Community Banking (CCB) delivered 
for our customers, communities and 
employees in 2024, as we focused on 
our priorities to: 
Grow and deepen relationships by 
engaging customers with products 
and services they love and expanding our distribution.
2. Deliver best-in-class financial 
performance. 
3. Leverage technology, data and 
artificial intelligence (AI) to drive 
customer value and speed to 
market.
4. Protect our customers and the firm 
through a strong risk and controls 
environment.
5. Cultivate talent to build highperforming, diverse teams where 
culture is a competitive advantage. 
This consistent, long-term strategy 
has served us well through volatile 
and uncertain times, and we believe 
it positions us well for the future. 
1. GROW, ENGAGE AND DEEPEN 
RELATIONSHIPS 
Across CCB, we serve more than 84 
million consumers and 7 million small 
business clients1. We’ve grown consumer relationships by 14% from 2019 
(3% year-over-year) and small business 
relationships by 51% (10% year-overyear) by engaging customers with 
products, services and seamless experiences across both digital and branch 
channels. Our branches are still the 
storefront of JPMorganChase, with 
more than 41 million customers choosing to visit a Chase branch in 2024, 
up 12% since 2019 (4% year-over-year). 
Nearly 71 million customers were 
digitally active, up 35% since 2019 
(6% year-over-year). 
We’re not just growing our customer 
base. We’re also creating deep, 
enduring relationships by investing in 
industry-leading products and capabilities and improving the customer experience. Today, 28% of customers have 
at least two discrete products with us, 
up from 24% in 2019 (27% in 2023). 
2. DELIVER BEST-IN-CLASS 
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 
We’re proud of our financial results, 
which are an outcome of a customerfirst approach and a focus on operational excellence. We manage the 
business with a long-term, throughthe-cycle view. While the goal is to 
deliver best-in-class performance in 
any year or environment, we also aim 
to realize durable and profitable growth 
that is consistent with our 25% throughthe-cycle return on equity (ROE) target. 
For the fourth consecutive year, we 
exceeded that objective, delivering 
a 32% ROE in 2024. 
Consumers remain healthy despite 
excess cash having been largely 
drained from their balance sheets, 
which, to date, we view as normalization. Spend remains strong, fueled by 
a healthy labor market. By recent historical standards, today’s interest rates 
are elevated, even after a 100-basispoint reduction in 2024, and yieldseeking behaviors continue, albeit at 
a slower pace. Importantly, we are 
successfully defending primary bank 
relationships and capturing money in 
motion. In 2024, we retained over 85% 
of flows within Banking and Wealth 
Management. As expected, declining 
rates drove deposit margin compression, while ongoing yield-seeking 
behavior resulted in a 6% decline in

average deposit balances from 2023. 
In Card, we continue to see strong 
demand for our products and low levels 
of attrition, which resulted in a 12% 
increase in average loans over 2023. 
Taking deposits and loans together, 
where we see offsetting impacts, net 
interest income was $54.9 billion, flat 
compared with 2023.
Noninterest revenue of $16.6 billion 
increased 10%, driven by strong annual 
fee growth in Card, coupled with the 
scaling of Wealth Management and 
Connected Commerce, and the easing 
of cyclical and secular headwinds in 
both Home Lending and Auto.
Expenses of $38 billion were up 9% 
from 2023. We grew our distribution 
capacity as we added an incremental 
800 bankers, approximately 300 
advisors and nearly 70 branches to our 
network, all of which drive long-term 
growth. Through investments in data 
and technology, we’ve made great 
progress modernizing our infrastructure and developing products customers love. In marketing, where we have 
a data-driven, proven track record of 
success, we remain focused on opportunities to acquire customers across 
products and segments. Additionally, 
we saw strong account and transaction 
growth and engagement.
Against a macroeconomic backdrop 
similar to 2023, credit remains in line 
with expectations.
Maintaining our #1 position across 
industry-leading businesses 
We’re the clear market leader in 
Consumer and Business Banking, as 
well as Card, on the back of strong 
new account acquisition and primary 
bank relationships. 
Consumer and Business Banking: 
We maintained the #1 position in 2024 
and outperformed large bank peers 
with 11.3% national retail deposit share, 
up 220 basis points since 2019 (down 
7 basis points year-over-year). We also 
remained #1 in small business with 
9.7% primary bank share, up 28 basis 
points since 2019 (up 25 basis points 
year-over-year). We ended 2024 
with 44 million Consumer Banking 
relationships (up 4% year-over-year)
and 7 million small business clients1 
(up 10% year-over-year). Approximately 
80% of consumers and 65% of small 
business owners with whom we have 
banking relationships consider us their 
primary bank. 
This position reflects strong new 
account acquisition, as well as over a 
decade of investment in our branch 
network. Historic investments continue 
to mature, and we invest for the future 
with plans to get to 15% national retail 
deposit share.
Banking is local, and nearly 1 million 
customers walk into a Chase branch 
each day. The bank’s team of approximately 50,000 experts helps customers transact, open accounts, and get 
information and advice. In 2024, 85% of 
business checking accounts and nearly 
30% of Chase-branded cards were 
opened in branches. 
Branch expansion remains core to 
long-term growth. Since 2019, we’ve 
added over 860 new branches, more 
than all large bank peers combined, 
and we are the only bank with a presence in all 48 contiguous states. As a 
result, Chase covers more Americans 
than any other bank, with 68% of the 
U.S. population within an accessible 
drive to one of our branches. We are on 
track to meet the goals we announced 
last year to build 500 new branches by 
2027, contributing to our long-term 
plans of reaching 75% of the national 
population within an accessible drive 
and over 50% within each state. This 
goal demonstrates our commitment to 
providing local banking services in all 
communities, from urban centers to 
rural areas across America’s heartland. 
In 2024, we entered 10 new markets, 
opened approximately 150 new 
branches – including the first two 
J.P. Morgan Financial Centers in 
Manhattan and San Francisco – and 
three Community Center branches in 
the Bronx and Brooklyn in New York 
City and Columbus, Ohio. We’re also 
investing in existing branches, refreshing nearly 450 in 2024. 
We aim to be the bank for all and 
remain committed to evolving products, services and experiences to meet 
the unique needs of each customer 
segment. In 2024, we enhanced Secure 
BankingSM, a product geared toward 
emerging segments, and introduced 
J.P. Morgan Private Client as a new tier 
in our affluent product continuum. We 
also launched new tools to help small 
business owners run their businesses, 
including invoicing, payroll and customer insights.
The First Republic integration is complete, and we’re proud to have retained 
approximately 90% of banking clients 
and over 95% of deposit balances across 
the firm. In the Wealth Management 
businesses, we retained nearly 80% 
of advisors and assets. 
Card: In 2024, we remained the #1 
credit card issuer in the U.S. and 
continued to gain share. We increased 
total active accounts to nearly 60 million and outstandings to $214 billion 
(up 12% year-over-year). This fueled 
market share gains to 23.5% share of 
sales and 17.3% share of outstandings, 
up 110 basis points and 90 basis points, 
respectively, since 2019 (each up 
60 basis points year-over-year).
Our ongoing investment in marketing 
distribution is driving strong new 
account production and engaging 
existing cardmembers. In 2019, we 
booked 7.8 million new card accounts, 
and since 2022, we’ve consistently 
booked approximately 10 million new 
accounts each year with strong return 

CONSUMER & COMMUNITY BANKING

profiles. This step-change in growth 
will serve as a solid financial foundation 
for the Card franchise for years to 
come. Through industry-leading product benefits, we drove engagement 
with existing cardmembers, and in 
2024, more than 60% of customers 
chose Chase as their top-of-wallet 
card5, which is a record high. 
We invest in benefits and capabilities 
to keep our cards fresh and relevant, 
and in 2024:
• Refreshed the Marriott Bonvoy Bold® 
card with an embedded lending 
benefit, inspiring cardmembers to 
“Travel Now, Pay Later” and to divide 
qualifying purchases into equal 
monthly payments with no interest 
or plan fees.
• Launched Chase Pay Over Time® at 
Amazon checkout so customers can 
break up large purchases into fixed 
monthly payments without requiring 
a credit check or forfeiting rewards.
• Extended our partnership with 
InterContinental Hotels Group and 
further deepened the relationship 
into Chase TravelSM and other 
businesses. 
We continue to focus on adding value 
for key segments where we have outsized opportunity to grow, including:
• New-to-credit customers: Continued 
to scale the Freedom Rise® card 
while increasing the number of 
annual new accounts within this 
segment by 85% year-over-year.
• Small businesses: Refreshed the Ink 
Business Cash® card to better serve 
the needs of smaller businesses. 
Continued to deepen with Chase 
Business Banking clients, who 
contributed to over 50% of business 
card spend growth.
• Affluent clients: Expanded our awardwinning lounge network, opening five 
new Sapphire airport lounges, including at LaGuardia Airport. The Points 
Guy named it the best new U.S. 
airport lounge and recognized the 
Sapphire Preferred® card as the best 
travel rewards card in 2024. 
These strategies will fuel our plans 
to get to 20% share of outstandings.
Scaling growth businesses 
In Connected Commerce and Wealth 
Management, we have the assets to 
win and outsized opportunity to 
grow to what we view is our fair share, 
given the breadth of CCB relationships. 
These businesses are natural adjacencies to credit card and banking, and 
both diversify and strengthen the 
CCB franchise.
Connected Commerce: We continue to 
build a powerful two-sided platform to 
connect customers with relevant merchant brands. In 2024, we reached over 
$23 billion in volume and are on track 
to reach $30 billion in volume in 2025. 
Since launching Connected Commerce 
in 2021, we’ve doubled volume on both 
Travel and Offers platforms. 
Travel – We maintained our rank as a 
top five consumer leisure travel provider 
and secured the #3 spot6 in 2024. We 
launched Chase TravelSM as a standalone brand in 2024 to help customers 
discover, plan and experience travel and 
delivered $11 billion in booked volume, 
up 9% year-over-year. We also scaled 
The Edit by Chase TravelSM to more 
than 1,000 hotels, offering customers 
exclusive benefits and experiences at 
our curated list of premium hotels. The 
share of Chase proprietary card spend 
on our platform has increased by more 
than 200 basis points since 2021, and 
we expect ongoing growth.
Chase Media SolutionsSM – Our new 
digital media business connects customers’ personal passions and interests with brands they love. Customers 
benefit from the ability to earn extra 
cash back at places where they already 
shop or just discovered. Since launching last year, we’ve experienced strong 
growth with 18 billion offers and $12 
billion of customer spend on the platform in 2024, up 31% year-over-year. 
Payments and Lending Innovation – 
In payments, trust and security are top 
priorities. We continue to invest and 
use assets that we believe will help protect customers from fraud and scams. 
This includes adding steps in the 
ZelleSM user flow to warn customers 
about scams. As a result, we had a 
26% reduction in fraud and scam claim 
rates in 2024. We are making enhancements to new capabilities, including 
#1 banking portal 
in the United States 4
#1 in total combined 
U.S. credit and debit 
payments volume 
#1 in U.S. retail deposit 
market share
#1 primary bank for

preventing higher-risk transactions 
that originate from social media. To 
introduce new, secure payments solutions, we’ve rolled out PazeSM, a digital 
wallet created in partnership with Early 
Warning Services. We’ve onboarded 
40 merchants and expect it will 
continue to scale.
In lending, we now offer a range of Pay 
Over Time® solutions across credit and 
debit cards, both in our own and partner digital channels, and we’ve had 
strong customer adoption. In 2024, 
over 6 million customers used our flexible payments and lending solutions 
(compared with over 5 million in 2023), 
totaling $10.7 billion in originations, up 
from $8.5 billion in 2023. 
Wealth Management: We reached 
a milestone of $1 trillion in client 
investment assets ahead of schedule, 
doubling assets since 2019 (up 34% 
year-over-year). While the First Republic 
acquisition and strong market performance in 2024 provided tailwinds, 
nearly half of this growth was driven by 
a record 150,000 first-time investors7 
(up 27% year-over-year), product 
enhancements (such as launching fractional shares in Self-Directed Investing) 
and investments in advisor hiring (adding approximately 300 net advisors in 
2024 alone). In fact, we had a record 
year for advisors, doubling net flows 
per advisor relative to 2019. These 
factors should continue to spur growth. 
Our branch referral program was 
particularly impactful with more than 
90% of first-time investors7 being 
introduced to J.P. Morgan Wealth 
Management by their banker. 
We have tremendous opportunity to 
further advance growth by leveraging 
existing assets and continuing to invest 
in products and distribution. 
Customers increasingly want to manage 
their banking and investments together, 
and we are uniquely positioned to fill 
that need and capitalize on the opportunity. More than 5 million affluent households have banking relationships with 
us, but the majority still have their 
investment relationships elsewhere. 
We continue to invest to meet customers’ evolving wealth management 
needs. As a result, 2024 was a breakthrough year in which we made significant progress in our digital customer 
experience. In 2024, J.D. Power ranked 
us #1 in Wealth Management Digital 
Experience Satisfaction8 among fullservice and self-directed investors. 
Secured Lending
In both Home Lending and Auto, we’ve 
faced a few years of challenging market 
conditions, but we continue to focus on 
what we can control while managing 
returns on a through-the-cycle basis. 
We make ongoing investments in products, experiences and technology platforms that position us for growth as 
conditions become more favorable. 
These two businesses remain strategically important, as they provide diversification and help us serve customers’ 
needs in life’s key moments.
Home Lending: We continue to face 
some of the strongest market headwinds we’ve seen in generations, as 
high rates are coupled with limited 
housing supply and elevated prices. 
Since 2019, home prices are up more 
than 50% (roughly flat year-over-year), 
inventory is down approximately 15% 
(albeit recovering strongly and up 
over 20% year-over-year) and mortgage rates have increased to nearly 
7% (roughly flat from 2023). 
Despite these challenges, in 2024 
we scaled originations to $41 billion 
in volume, up from $35 billion in 2023, 
while maintaining our position as the 
#1 owned servicer. We scaled Chase 
MyHomeSM, a digital home shopping 
platform, to promote deeper engagement and generate leads. In 2024, 
over 9 million unique users visited 
Chase MyHomeSM (up 46% year-overyear). We experienced an increase of 
approximately 20% in customers who 
engage with high-value features, 
including searching for homes, viewing 
insights on their current property and 
mortgage, and understanding how 
much they can afford.
Our investments in technology, data 
and AI enhance our sales and underwriting capabilities, improve productivity, and facilitate efficiencies and speed 
to market. Our newly modernized loan 
origination system enabled us to roll 
out a home equity product in 2024 to 
provide additional lending options for 
customers.
Auto: The industry showed signs of 
improvement, with COVID-era, secular 
headwinds abating. In 2024, new vehicle sales recovered from pandemic 
lows to about 90% of 2019 levels 
(up 2% year-over-year).
While the industry outlook remains 
uncertain, Chase Auto has been on 
a strong growth trajectory. Up 19% 
from 2019, the business originated 
$40 billion in 2024 compared with 
$41 billion the year prior. Notably, lease 
originations have rebounded from 
recent lows, though they remain below 
pre-pandemic levels. We continue to 
enhance digital capabilities and drive 
engagement with customers. In 2024, 
over 13 million unique users visited 
our digital car shopping and financing 
platform, Finance & DriveSM, down 
12% year-over-year. Importantly, the 
number of customers engaging with 
high-value features (including shopping for a car and pre-qualifying for a 
loan) was up 16% year-over-year, which 
reflects our focus to deepen engagement with our digital tools.
J.D. Power scores indicate our products and services resonate with customers, as we ranked #1 in Digital 
Experience for Customer Satisfaction 
among Non-Captive Automotive 
Finance Lenders9. 

Finally, we’ve increased operational 
efficiency across the business. About 
80% of all applications are automatically decisioned, and we continue to 
streamline and automate more backend processes. 
3. LEVERAGE TECHNOLOGY, 
DATA AND AI TO DRIVE 
CUSTOMER VALUE AND SPEED 
TO MARKET 
Our technology investments enable 
business growth and customer 
engagement, resulting in market share 
gains, record channel satisfaction 
and continued improvements to net 
promoter scores.
In 2024, we increased investments in 
product, technology and customer 
experience to approximately $4 billion 
to accelerate innovation, modernization and AI readiness.
Our innovation agenda focuses on 
improving digital products and investing 
in personalized customer experiences. 
These investments support increased 
payment volumes, more targeted offers 
and enhanced financial planning tools.
Modernization investments improve our 
scale, resilience and speed to market. 
With the migration to new data centers 
largely behind us, we’re investing to 
enhance core platforms, particularly in 
Card, Consumer Banking and Home 
Lending. Modernization efforts aren’t 
just about technology but also about 
elevating the quality, accessibility and 
usability of our data. We’ve nearly completed the migration of our data to the 
public cloud, which is critical for scaling 
experimentation and innovation.
Investments in technology and data 
are essential for AI readiness. We were 
early movers in AI and have invested in 
it for over a decade. We initially focused 
on risk management, such as fraud 
detection. We’ve since made significant progress in operational efficiencies and revenue growth, including 
personalization and sales effectiveness. To increase AI readiness, we 
continue to modernize data and invest 
in platforms to scale AI and machine 
learning broadly across the organization. As we implement these ideas in 
a controlled manner, we‘re driving 
efficiencies – both large and small – 
in every process, function and product.
4. PROTECT OUR CUSTOMERS 
AND THE FIRM
A strong risk and controls environment 
is core to who we are and what we do. 
We earn customers’ trust by providing 
safe and secure access to banking, 
and we protect the firm and shareholders through a rigorous commitment to 
a fortress balance sheet and throughthe-cycle decision making.
5. CULTIVATE TALENT
Our more than 140,000 employees 
across the globe help make dreams 
possible for tens of millions of customers, strengthening the communities 
where we operate and the economy 
overall. People and culture continue to 
be our greatest competitive advantages, helping us achieve the best 
business outcomes. We’re proud to 
attract and develop employees who 
reflect diverse backgrounds and 
perspectives, and we are committed 
to helping employees build rewarding, 
long-term careers at the firm.
2025 LOOK AHEAD
CCB continues to be a growth-oriented 
franchise that operates from a position 
of strength with strong financial performance. We focus on building durable 
customer relationships across segments 
and in communities across the U.S. 
From where we stand today, we’re confidently building upon a stable foundation. Consumers and small businesses 
have healthy balance sheets, and cash 
sorting feels largely behind us. 
While the regulatory environment looks 
different from a year ago, there’s still a 
significant amount of uncertainty. In 
this – like everything – we’ll focus more 
on where the puck is going instead of 
reacting to a specific moment in time to 
create maximum strategic flexibility 
and adapt accordingly. We can’t predict everything 2025 will bring, but we 
have confidence in our growth strategy 
and discipline.

COMMERCIAL & INVESTMENT BANK
Commercial & 
Investment Bank
2024 was a transformative year for our 
business. The combination of our 
Commercial Banking and Corporate & 
Investment Bank businesses was a 
significant step forward in our mission 
to deliver more value to our clients and 
maximize the value of our franchise. 
The new Commercial & Investment 
Bank (CIB) leverages the combined 
strengths of our united businesses and 
offers a more cohesive organization, 
enabling us to better align our capabilities for clients of all sizes across the 
globe, from startups to multinationals. 
We are well-positioned to respond to 
significant industry trends, such as the 
rapid growth of private markets and 
the expansion of important client ecosystems, including financial sponsors 
and the Innovation Economy. 
Our performance in 2024 highlighted 
the effectiveness of this strategy and 
the value it is creating for our clients 
and shareholders. 
DELIVERING RECORD RESULTS 
In 2024, financial markets continued to 
adjust following the injection of trillions 
of dollars into the global economy 
during the pandemic. Economic optimism rose among business leaders in 
both large companies and the middle 
market. Dealmaking rebounded and 
trading surged as investors repositioned their portfolios in response to 
inflation data, interest rate cuts and the 
busiest international election calendar 
on record. 
Against this backdrop, the CIB reported 
net income of $25 billion on record 
$70 billion in revenue, setting new 
benchmarks across major business 
lines and achieving a full-year return 
on equity of 18%. 
Global Banking 
Our Investment Banking franchise 
maintained its top position in global 
fees with a 9.3% market share1 and, 
for the first time, ranked #1 in M&A, 
debt capital markets (DCM) and equity 
capital markets (ECM) 1. This exceptional performance is a testament to 
our strategic focus and strength of 
our client relationships. 
In M&A, J.P. Morgan ended the year 
as the top advisor, advising on 395 
transactions totaling more than $744 
billion1. The business earned $3.3 
billion in advisory fees to finish the year 
with a leading 9.6% market share1.

volatility and interest rate cuts supported a pickup in debt underwriting 
fees and equity transactions, with 
DCM fees rising to $4.1 billion, up from 
$2.7 billion in 2023, and ECM fees 
increasing to $1.7 billion from $1.2 
billion. We maintained our #1 position 
in both areas with wallet share of 
8.4% and 11.0% in DCM and ECM1, 
respectively. 
Our Commercial Banking and Global 
Corporate Banking (GCB) businesses 
are also key growth drivers for the new 
CIB. Middle Market Banking revenue 
has doubled since 2020, driven by 
client acquisition and market expansion, including the purchase of First 
Republic. In 2024, we added more than 
2,500 new clients, and we now have a 
strong presence in 90 of the top 100 
U.S. metropolitan areas. Similarly, GCB 
added over 450 new clients last year. 
With bankers in over 40 countries, we 
are covering the largest firms across 
the world. And in Commercial Real 
Estate, where we have long been the 
#1 multifamily lender in the U.S., we 
are deepening relationships and 
becoming the primary operating bank 
for our clients. 
Payments 
In Payments, we delivered record 
revenue of $18.4 billion2. The business 
has experienced impressive growth, 
gaining 260 basis points over the last 
five years3 to reach a market share of 
9.5% for Treasury Services. A key 
competitive advantage is our ability 
to provide a complete set of advanced 
payments solutions to clients around 
the world.
Markets 
Markets reported record revenue of 
$30 billion, a 7% increase year-overyear, with equities up 13% and fixed 
income up 5%. In a year dominated 
by macro themes, our rates, foreign 
exchange, commodities and emerging 
markets desks excelled in helping clients navigate complex markets. 
The year began with expectations of 
aggressive Federal Reserve easing, 
but global inflation proved stickier than 
anticipated, prompting adjustments 
across institutional portfolios. We have 
consistently ranked #1 in Markets, 
finishing 2024 with an overall market 
share of 11.4%.
Securities Services 
Securities Services delivered another 
record year with $5.1 billion in revenue5, 
an increase of over $800 million since 
2020. This business plays a central role 
in J.P. Morgan’s strategy to act as a 
complete counterparty to institutional 
investor clients, enabling the firm to 
meet their needs across the full investment life cycle. Securities Services 
operates at remarkable scale, with 
assets under custody growing by 14% 
in the last five years to over $35 trillion 
at the end of 2024.

COMMERCIAL & INVESTMENT BANK
While we are proud of our performance, 
we aren’t standing still. 
In an environment of fierce competition, it’s crucial to adapt and innovate. 
We continue to make sustained 
investments in our capabilities and 
solutions, leveraging the full force of 
JPMorganChase to stay ahead and 
provide what’s best for our clients. 
INCREASING OUR FOOTPRINT 
To serve clients where they are and to 
provide deep sector expertise, we are 
expanding into new geographies and 
investing in our capabilities. 
Our global growth plans are underway 
with a particular focus on expanding 
our footprint to new markets. Over the 
past five years, we have organically 
added banking coverage of midsized 
companies across 24 new countries. 
Extending our capabilities adds tremendous value for our clients seeking 
access to markets and capital around 
the world. This international growth has 
contributed to an increase in Banking 
and Payments revenue from roughly 
$25 billion to more than $35 billion over 
the same period.
We are also investing in key growth 
sectors. Since the start of 2024, we’ve 
hired more than 300 bankers across 
Global Banking. Our goal is to continue 
to grow market share across 28 subsectors in investment banking with a 
particular emphasis on healthcare, 
technology, infrastructure and the 
middle market. Despite being the leading franchise in the world for more than 
a decade, there are still plenty of ways 
we can grow and expand our relationships over time. 
Serving client ecosystems 
We are partnering across the firm to 
deliver more value to important client 
ecosystems, such as financial sponsors, 
the Innovation Economy, sovereign 
wealth funds and family offices. 
Financial sponsors represent a major 
market opportunity, with an estimated 
$3 trillion7 of investable assets. Over 
the last five years, about half of the 
Investment Banking wallet from 
sponsors has come from middlemarket-sized transactions8. As the 
bank to over 32,000 middle market 
companies, we have a significant 
competitive advantage. To support our 
growth, we’ve expanded our teams 
globally. Strong collaboration among 
our Markets, Banking and Private Bank 
teams has resulted in differentiated 
dialogue with financial sponsor clients, 
who are expected to drive a significant 
amount of activity around the world.
By strengthening the partnership 
between Banking and Markets, we have 
been able to bolster our capabilities in 
private credit. Over the past four years, 
we have successfully deployed more 
than $10 billion in 100 direct lending 
financings. Recently, we announced 
that we are dedicating up to $50 billion 
from our own balance sheet, along with 
nearly $15 billion from our co-lending 
partners, highlighting our determination to be a leader in both the broadly 
syndicated and private credit markets. 
Our investment also continues in 
banking the full Innovation Economy 
ecosystem – the network of venturebacked companies, founders and 
investors – where we had nearly 30% 
client growth in 2024. Our ability to 
support clients throughout every stage 
of their life cycle is a true differentiator. 
As they scale and grow, we are uniquely 
positioned to meet their increasingly 
complex and global needs.
Delivering leading capabilities 
In Global Banking, we’re equipping our 
commercial, corporate and investment 
banking teams with data-enabled 
analytics and intuitive applications to 
best serve our clients. Leveraging the 
latest technology and J.P. Morgan’s 
unparalleled access to data across 
global markets, we are empowering our 
teams with rich market insights that 
lead to better client outcomes. 
In Payments, we operate at scale, 
processing over $10 trillion9 in 
payments daily, with a 5% increase in 
volumes year-over-year. J.P. Morgan 
is also the largest U.S. dollar clearer 
globally, with over 28% of SWIFT market 
share10, and the largest merchant

acquirer in North America11, with settled 
sales of about $2.6 trillion globally. 
There is still significant room for 
growth, particularly with corporates 
and in international markets. With that 
goal, we are investing in innovation, 
enhancing product capabilities and 
modernizing to improve the resiliency 
of our platforms. We have expanded 
our biometric payments offerings, 
rebranded our blockchain business to 
Kinexys by J.P. Morgan – processing 
over $2 billion in transactions daily – 
and launched our acquiring services in 
France through our partnership with 
the Cartes Bancaires network. 
In Markets, we continue to add value 
for clients across the trading life cycle, 
from research and market insights to 
execution and post-trade services. The 
Global Research team, which plays a 
crucial role in acquiring and retaining 
clients in this business, achieved a 
clean sweep of #1 rankings in Extel’s 
Global Leaders Tables for research 
providers. J.P. Morgan was named the 
world’s top research house for the fifth 
consecutive year. J.P. Morgan Markets, 
our client research platform, underwent a redesign to improve the user 
experience, personalize content and 
make it easier to access our trading 
services. 
Investments in technology have also 
enhanced the scale and resiliency of 
our Securities Services platforms, 
enabling revenue growth and securing 
major new wins. Among recent innovations, our Fusion platform provides 
clients with tools for data discovery, 
simplified access to consistent data, 
and proprietary analytics within a 
robust governance framework. 
INVESTING IN THE CLIENT 
EXPERIENCE 
To maintain our leadership positions in 
highly competitive markets, enhancing 
the client experience on our digital 
platforms is a top priority. This year, we 
will continue to harmonize platforms, 
creating a more seamless and consistent experience and providing easier 
access to J.P. Morgan’s extensive 
thought leadership and global 
capabilities. 
By simplifying and updating our systems, we’ll eliminate barriers clients 
may have encountered when switching 
among applications and workflows. In 
addition, greater personalization will 
ensure that the firm’s wide range of 
content, products and services is 
tailored to each client’s specific needs. 
We expect these investments to boost 
client satisfaction and open up revenue 
opportunities - while decreasing complexity and costs. 
The first step in achieving these objectives has been to modernize our infrastructure and make the necessary 
investments to move core infrastructure into the cloud. As of today, 98% 
of production applications have been 
successfully migrated to strategic 
data centers and the public cloud, and 
approximately 50% of applications now 
operate on the public or private cloud. 
This positions us to leverage cloud, 
data and artificial intelligence (AI) 
innovations that will be critical for the 
future of our business. 
HARNESSING THE POWER OF 
OUR DATA 
The CIB has incredibly rich proprietary 
data assets. 
We have made significant strides to 
build a data-driven business and 
transform the way we work. Using our 
data, we are reimagining how we serve 
clients, manage risk and optimize 
our operations. We are investing to 
build the data infrastructure needed 
to integrate AI into our operating 
environment. 
The CIB now has over 175 AI use cases 
in production, with large parts of our 
team using our internal large language 
model platform to deliver insights and 
improve efficiency across a range of 
daily tasks. 
Among other operational efficiency 
gains, AI and machine learning technology has enabled the CIB to improve its 
know your customer processes, leading to a nearly 40% reduction in unit 
costs. It also meaningfully improved 
the cost and effectiveness of sanctions 
screening and fraud protection. 
Meanwhile, AI is enabling us to improve 
the client experience and offering, 
using data across the business to 
create recommendations based on 
client interactions in over 40 countries. 
Firmwide data also plays a key role in 
the unified client dashboard we are 
developing for our bankers, an especially important initiative as we look to 
better serve complex client segments 
like financial sponsors. 
Other AI use cases include tools to 
help corporate clients better predict 
cash flows, to optimize the use of 
capital in our trading business and, 
in Global Research, to quickly find 
relevant insights from reports and 
economic data. 
MAKING A POSITIVE IMPACT 
AROUND THE WORLD 
We are a purpose-led organization and 
continue to dedicate capital, expertise 
and resources to drive real impact for 
our clients and communities. 
In 2024, we supported vital institutions 
– including hospitals, schools, nonprofits, state and local governments, 

and transportation infrastructure – 
with more than $8 billion in credit 
facilities and over $19 billion in capital 
markets financing, as well as provided 
funding for over 8,000 incremental 
affordable housing and rental units12. 
In the United States, we financed 
affordable housing in Chicago’s Lincoln 
Park neighborhood and the renovation 
of a vital blood sciences unit in New 
York City, as well as the construction 
of the world’s first purpose-built women’s soccer stadium in Kansas City. 
Internationally, our Public Sector group 
continued to help clients invest in a 
more sustainable future and improve 
economic prospects for people around 
the world. Among its work, the team 
supported conservation efforts in 
El Salvador with a $1 billion loan facility 
to free up funds for the Lempa River 
watershed and, in Brazil, we arranged 
an $800 million loan to Banco do Brasil 
to help smallholder farmers operate 
their land more sustainably. 
In the CIB, we believe that our true success is not purely defined by financial 
performance but also derived from 
making a positive impact and uplifting 
communities around the world. 
LOOKING FORWARD 
J.P. Morgan’s new CIB has further 
strengthened its market position. 
The integration of two industry-leading 
businesses will drive value for years to 
come, enabling us to offer more seamless and tailored solutions to meet the 
distinct needs of diverse businesses. 
We have a tremendous client franchise 
and a complete set of products and 
services. We also have the capacity to 
invest through cycles, enabling us to 
innovate to extend our competitive 
advantage and focus relentlessly on 
improving the client experience.
Even in the face of uncertain times, 
J.P. Morgan stands ready to support 
our clients. Our strong operating 
discipline and fortress principles allow 
us to be there for them in any market 
environment.
We are incredibly proud of our 
exceptional team for everything 
they do to support our clients and 
communities around the world. 
Looking forward, we are excited 
about the many opportunities ahead 
for this extraordinary franchise.

ASSET & WEALTH MANAGEMENT
Asset & 
Wealth Management
J.P. Morgan has a proud fiduciary 
history spanning nearly two centuries 
of managing client assets. Throughout 
each decade, we have consistently 
delivered valuable insights and strong 
performance to a distinguished clientele 
worldwide, including governments, 
major institutions, central banks, 
sovereign wealth funds, CEOs, founders 
and individuals. Our steadfast commitment to delivering strong and consistent results has solidified our position 
as a leader in industry growth. Whether 
supporting a first-time saver seeking 
cash management solutions or retirement options at a Chase branch or 
serving a major state pension plan in 
need of tactical asset allocation overlay 
strategies, our franchise continues to 
strengthen with each new relationship, 
earning the trust of our clients.
Having had the privilege of working 
for Jamie Dimon for over two decades, 
I am reminded every day that success 
is not accidental and should never be 
taken for granted. Sustainable growth 
requires constant innovation, extraordinary focus, intensity and drive, 
coupled with a fortress mindset – always 
preparing for the toughest challenges 
while remaining poised to seize new 
opportunities. We are in a fiercely 
competitive race to identify the best 
opportunities for our clients and for our 
future growth while simultaneously 
maintaining our unwavering focus 
on cutting waste and achieving 
operational excellence.
In Asset & Wealth Management (AWM), 
my partners and I work tirelessly to 
optimize client portfolios and futureproof them for what lies ahead. We 
achieve this by delivering leading 
investment performance, leveraging 
what I believe is the most exceptional 
talent in the industry and executing our 
most ambitious investment agenda to 
date. Our focus on investing in cuttingedge technology and our elite talent, 
while driving out inefficiencies, has led 
us to highly profitable growth for our 
shareholders. 
Our clients vote daily on our success 
with their consistent contribution of 
new assets. They have demonstrated 
their ongoing confidence in our strategy 
by entrusting us with an additional 
$486 billion in net new assets, bringing 
the total to nearly $1 trillion of inflows 
over the past two years. This remarkable achievement stands as the 
ultimate testament to the strength 
and effectiveness of our business.
Building on this tremendous momentum, we have achieved record results 
across nearly all financial metrics, 
reaching all-time highs in five key 
performance indicators, as shown in 
the top right chart on this page.
ACTIVELY MANAGING OUR 
CLIENTS’ ASSETS
Over the past two decades, we have 
focused on and invested in the industry’s 
leading active management platform, 
even as many of our peers double down 
on passive strategies. In today’s market 
environment, where having fundamental 
insights is critical, we believe our 
responsibility is to proactively seek 
opportunities that are not yet reflected 
in backward-looking benchmark 
weightings. We have responded swiftly 
and adeptly to various market cycles, 
consistently achieving world-class 
investment performance. Our peerleading performance has enabled us to 
deliver positive outcomes for our investors, strengthening our clients’ trust 
in us as their long-term partner and 
attracting more clients than ever before.

BEST-IN-CLASS ADVISORY 
TEAMS
Over the past five years, we have 
strategically invested in expanding and 
elevating our global advisor teams to 
enhance our capabilities and meet 
clients’ diverse and evolving needs. 
This includes both hiring new advisors 
and expanding our comprehensive 
training programs to equip them 
with the latest knowledge and skills, 
ensuring they remain at the forefront 
of industry trends. With over 9,500 
advisors, our Wealth Management 
network reflects a 6% growth in 2024 
– a notable achievement given industry 
stagnation – demonstrating the 
scale of our global platform and our 
commitment to first-class service and 
expertise. We aim to build future-ready 
advisory teams in Wealth Management, 
Institutional and Retail/Funds, setting a 
standard that is admired by our 
competitors.
A key component of our strategy to be 
the industry’s leading active manager 
is our substantial investment in our 
research capabilities. In 2024, we 
employed 490 proprietary research 
analysts across various asset classes, 
underscoring our commitment to making informed decisions and embedding 
research into our culture and business 
ecosystem. In the past year alone, our 
research team provided coverage on 
approximately 4,700 companies and 
conducted nearly 11,000 company visits 
and engagements. These real-time, 
on-the-ground insights from around the 
world, infused with JPMorganChase’s 
dominant technology, empower our 
teams to adeptly navigate complex 
global markets for our clients. 
By harnessing and leveraging advanced 
technologies – such as artificial 
intelligence (AI), machine learning and 
proprietary data science – we enhance 
all aspects of our business, significantly 
improving our risk management capabilities, streamlining operations and 
boosting overall efficiency. Our recent 
launch of GPT-Insights exemplifies this 
commitment, streamlining the research 
process for Asset Management (AM) 
investors. This proprietary generative 
AI tool creates comprehensive company 
reports from multiple sources, highlighting both internal and external 
perspectives in an easily digestible 
format. Since its December 2024 
launch, GPT-Insights has reduced 
research task times by up to 85%, 
guiding investors on where to delve 
deeper. Our dedication to leveraging 
state-of-the-art technology not only 
strengthens our competitive edge but 
also aligns with our broader goal of 
delivering superior value to our clients 
– from pilot to production to profitability. We are setting a new standard of 
innovation in the banking industry, 
driving sustainable growth and longterm shareholder value.
Lastly, in recent years we have 
made significant investments in our 
exchange-traded funds (ETF) platform. 
The combination of top active management performance and ETF expertise 
has positioned us as a leader in the 
rapidly expanding field of active ETFs. 
In 2024, we were the leader in inflows 
in both active management and active 
ETFs across the industry.

In addition to hiring and training, we

their productivity and scope. With over 
80% of AWM Front Office utilizing our 
J.P. Morgan Large Language Model

repetitive tasks, allowing our teams 
to focus on higher-value activities. 
These initiatives are integral to delivering exceptional service and driving 
sustainable growth.
HIGHLY CUSTOMIZED 
SOLUTIONS FOR EACH 
INDIVIDUAL
Our vision for personalized advice 
focuses on empowering both clients 
and advisors to make choices tailored 
to each unique situation. To enhance 
our capabilities, we made two important acquisitions: 55ip (in 2020) and 
OpenInvest (in 2021). Our technology 
teams leverage these acquisitions, 
alongside continuous proprietary developments, to equip every portfolio team 
with the most modern and advanced 
tools and resources. This enables them 
to customize preferences and concentrations, adapt to tax considerations 
and create portfolios that are aligned 
with their specific needs. We don’t 
believe any fiduciary manager should 
dictate choice or preferences for a 
client’s investment portfolio. Instead, 
we empower clients to specify criteria 
important to them, and J.P. Morgan 
teams execute accordingly.
We believe our fiduciary voice should 
be leveraged to influence the companies we invest in, drawing on our two 
centuries of collective knowledge to 
enhance long-term shareholder value 
creation. Our in-house stewardship 
teams operate independently, without 
relying on external proxy advisors to 
vote for us. In fact, we have taken major 
steps to minimize the influence of proxy 
advisory firms on our teams and no 
longer incorporate their research into 
the governance decisions made by our 
stewardship and investment professionals. We take pride in the active role 
our fundamental investors play in the 
governance process, utilizing their 
expertise and insights to ensure strong 
oversight for client portfolios.
ALTERNATIVES
Alternatives have always been a key 
differentiator in our clients’ portfolios, 
as we are among the leading providers 
and investors globally. Recently, this 
asset class has emerged as one of the 
industry’s largest and fastest-growing 
areas, primarily driven by the openended structure now available to 
individual investors. In response, we 
have strategically restructured our 
coverage into two distinct pillars: 
AWM Alternative Solutions and AM 
Private Markets. This new structure is 
designed to broaden our coverage and 
enable meaningful growth, leveraging 
our rich history of over 60 years and 
our extensive experience across 
various investment types. With these 
enhancements, we are poised to 
expand our coverage and unlock our 
deep expertise in this area, ultimately 
providing our clients with innovative 
and tailored investment solutions 
across the board – from third-party 
strategies to funds managed by our 
own teams. By aligning our resources 
and capabilities with the evolving needs 
of the market, we are well-equipped to 
navigate the complexities of the financial landscape and drive sustainable 
growth in this important area.

EVIDENCE THAT THIS 
STRATEGY IS WORKING: 
STRONG ROE FOR OUR FIRM 
AND SHAREHOLDERS
Our results are not only strong 
compared with every major competitor 
but are also crucial for the broader 
success of JPMorganChase. Our ability 
to deliver industry-leading return on 
equity (ROE) stems from our disciplined approach to managing every 
dollar on our balance sheet, contributing to a robust blended ROE for our 
shareholders. These results, achieved 
while maintaining significant investment in our business, speak to the 
strength of our franchise and the focus 
of our strategic investment agenda.
CONCLUSION
Our fiduciary commitment to our 
clients serves as our north star, guiding 
every aspect of our work. I am proud 
of how we have successfully guided 
our clients and shareholders through 
the challenges and volatility of recent 
years, all while making significant 
investments in the future.
As each of the three lines of business 
at JPMorganChase strives every day 
to excel in our respective areas, we 
are acutely aware that our collective 
strength surpasses the sum of our 
individual parts. Together with my 
Operating Committee partners in AWM, 
we work relentlessly to maximize the 
firm’s value to every client, delivering 
investment advice, liquidity management, capital markets expertise, credit,

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
Corporate Responsibility
More than 10 years ago, JPMorganChase 
began a historic investment in Detroit’s 
economic recovery after the city filed 
for bankruptcy. Leveraging research 
and data, we focused on the areas 
where our firm’s expertise and resources 
could make the greatest impact. As a 
result, we devoted business, philanthropic and human capital to promote 
neighborhood revitalization and affordable housing, skills training and job 
creation, small business growth and 
financial security for residents. Most 
important, despite being a bank headquartered in New York City, we showed 
up like a bank headquartered in Detroit.
The firm’s investments in Detroit, which 
helped spur economic growth throughout the city, also gave way to new commercial opportunities for our business. 
As the city’s credit rating jumped from 
junk bond to investment grade status 
and as home values doubled, our 
market share and commercial loans 
increased; so did our consumer and 
business banking accounts and balances. The takeaway – and business 
model it informed – was clear: Thriving 
communities are good for business. 
Fast forward to today: The Corporate 
Responsibility department’s work is a 
central part of our firm’s strategy. With 
team members around the world, we 
help JPMorganChase develop hyperlocal solutions to community challenges 
and forge meaningful partnerships with 
leaders in the public, private and nonprofit sectors. This multipronged 
approach contributes to the firm’s resiliency through economic cycles and 
creates strong local business conditions 
that bolster our competitive advantage. 
Many of our current initiatives that are 
designed to help generate economic 
growth originated in Detroit. Take our 
virtual call centers (VCC), which provide training and employment to customer service specialists who work 
from home. First launched in 2022, the 
VCC program grew from a collaboration with Detroit’s workforce agency 
(established with our help in 2017) to 
help us attract top talent in markets 
where we did not have traditional call 
centers. Our VCC team members have 
earned high customer satisfaction 
ratings, leading us to expand the 
program and tailor it to other markets, 
including Greater Baltimore, which 
recently welcomed a cohort of employees who are military spouses, and 
Atlanta, which offers customer support 
in English and Spanish.
Similarly, in Detroit we partnered with 
nonprofit and local government leaders to open Financial Empowerment 
Centers that offer guidance on how to 
manage finances, pay down debt, 
increase savings and access banking 
products. This model helped inspire 
many of the services we provide in our 
Community Center branches, where 
we help residents access affordable 
home loans, low-cost checking 
accounts and financial health education workshops in neighborhoods in 
Akron (Ohio), Dallas, Minneapolis and 
New Orleans, among others.
As we continually expand our work in 
communities, I am often asked, 
“Where’s the next Detroit?” My answer 
is simple: It’s every market we serve. 
From Columbus to the United Kingdom, San Francisco to Alabama, we 
take the time to understand a locale 
and what it needs to grow its economy. 
We then apply lessons we’ve learned in 
Detroit and elsewhere to execute a tailored approach with goals like creating 
jobs, training workers, increasing 
access to housing and helping people 
grow their savings – all while strengthening the firm’s bottom line. 
Our efforts in four very different markets, described below, just scratch the 
surface of how our team helps communities build wealth and catalyzes commercial impact. Click here to learn more.
COLUMBUS, OHIO
With more than 18,000 employees, 
720,000 customers, 57,800 small business clients and eight office buildings, 
it’s safe to say that JPMorganChase’s 
presence in Columbus is robust.
As one of the largest employers in 
Ohio, we have a bird’s-eye view of the 
incredible talent coming out of local 
educational institutions – but we 
have also observed that many workers 
struggle to access career paths in 
growing industries. Given our own local 
hiring needs, as well as those of our 
clients, over the last decade we have 
zeroed in on the opportunity to invest in 
students, supporting JPMorganChase’s 
recruiting and the region’s long-term 
economic outlook.
In 2020, we selected Columbus as one 
of five U.S. cities to participate in the 
firm’s New Skills Ready Network, a fiveyear, $35 million initiative to give young 
people real-world work experiences 
and help them access high-wage, 
in-demand jobs across industries like 
information technology (IT) and healthcare. Since then, according to our partner Ohio Excels, student participation 
in IT and healthcare career pathways 

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
has risen across Columbus City 
Schools, Columbus State Community 
College and The Ohio State University 
— with a significant increase in student 
participation in these pathways at 
Columbus City Schools among economically disadvantaged students.
Building on this foundation and armed 
with the insights we gained while 
strengthening Detroit’s workforce system, in September 2024 we supported 
the launch of a new collaborative that 
convenes business, education, community and elected officials to modernize 
the regional workforce infrastructure 
and strategy. Our philanthropic capital 
will help the collaborative to develop a 
road map that accounts for critical 
business needs and priorities, all while 
aligning efforts and resources across 
the system. Hand-in-hand with the 
mayor, public school superintendent 
and other community leaders, we are 
helping to build a Columbus where the 
labor market works for everybody.
Because despite being a bank headquartered in New York City, we are 
proud to show up like a bank headquartered in Columbus.
THE UNITED KINGDOM
JPMorganChase has a growing presence in the U.K. with more than 22,000 
employees across the country, our 
regional headquarters in London, a new 
technology center in Glasgow, and a 
significant footprint in Bournemouth 
and Edinburgh. Our business continues 
to prosper: We provide more than $614 
billion in credit and capital to nearly 
4,500 medium and large companies 
and support over 2 million retail 
customers.
Despite being the sixth largest economy and second biggest exporter of 
services globally, the U.K. is burdened 
with income inequality that is higher 
than any other large European country. 
Weak productivity growth has contributed to flattening wages and sluggish 
income growth that impact our clients, 
customers, employees and, by extension, our business.
Alongside local partners across sectors, we asked, “What else can we do 
about this?” Last May, we announced 
$50 million in funding that is focused 
on helping people access job opportunities and strengthen their financial 
future, bringing the firm’s total philanthropic support in the U.K. since 2019 
to $110 million. 
To carry this out, we are leveraging 
our position as a large employer by 
refreshing our recruitment practices 
to emphasize skills-based hiring and 
expanding this approach to entrylevel operations jobs. We continue to 
offer a work experience program to 
young people in secondary school in 
Attendees of a roundtable discussion following the announcement of a new philanthropic commitment 
to advance local career pathways. Participants included Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther, Columbus 
City Schools Superintendent and CEO Dr. Angela Chapman, and other members of the regional 
workforce collaborative.
Team members joined with nonprofit and government partners to discuss the firm’s latest commitment 
to help drive economic growth in the U.K. 

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
Bournemouth, Glasgow and London, 
and we will launch the program in 
Edinburgh later this year. This initiative 
to help students develop the key skills 
employers look for on candidates’ 
resumes complements the firm’s existing degree-level apprenticeship program and our Aspiring Professionals 
Programme (APP), which I wrote about 
in last year’s shareholder letter. The 
APP, run in partnership with the Social 
Mobility Foundation, has helped more 
than 850 young people secure a job 
at JPMorganChase and other firms 
since 2012.
At the same time, we are continuing 
to work with nonprofits and the U.K. 
government, British Business Bank 
and other industry leaders to support 
small businesses, consumers, workers, 
entrepreneurs and investors. We’re 
engaged in a range of initiatives, 
including the Careers and Enterprise 
Company’s efforts to help prepare 
young people for a career in growth 
sectors and Nest Insight’s work to test 
product innovations to help low-paid 
employees build savings in preparation 
for unexpected expenses.
Because despite being a bank headquartered in New York City, we are 
proud to show up like a bank headquartered in the United Kingdom.
SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA
Our history in the Greater Bay Area 
dates back more than 120 years. In 
the past decade, we have opened a 
technology campus in Palo Alto and a 
Community Center branch in Oakland, 
and we have expanded our Innovation 
Economy banking franchise across 
industries, including applied technology, enterprise software, life sciences 
and disruptive commerce. On top of 
this, we have hosted our annual Healthcare Conference in downtown San 
Francisco for more than 40 years, 
driving an estimated $104.9 million 
in economic impact to the city in 
2025 alone.
However, partially due to the pandemic, 
the city has experienced reduced foot 
traffic, with shuttered storefronts and 
office vacancies hitting 36% by the end 
of 2024. This drop in economic activity 
continues to hinder a business’s ability 
to reach current and prospective 
customers and employees, prompting 
us to work with other companies, 
including Visa and Gap, to pave the way 
for a more vibrant downtown. Together, 
we are collaborating on two initiatives: 
the Downtown Volunteer Coalition, 
focused on engaging employees to 
revitalize San Francisco, and Advance 
SF, a coalition of leading corporate 
employers working to address issues 
impacting San Francisco’s businesses.
In addition to these initiatives, we are 
pursuing philanthropic programs – 
modeled after those that contributed to 
Detroit’s comeback – to support local 
businesses, clean up the streets, and 
bring residents and visitors back to 
the city’s downtown. A portion of new 
philanthropic capital will help launch 
the Downtown San Francisco Vibrancy 
Loan Fund, with additional support 
from U.S. Bank and the City of San 
Francisco’s Office of Economic and 
Workforce Development, to help promote the recovery of small businesses 
through low-interest loans provided by 
Main Street Launch, a local nonprofit 
lender. At the same time, we are 
making continued investments to 
upgrade our office building in the heart 
of the city for our clients and employees, helping to boost commerce in 
the neighborhood.
Because despite being a bank headquartered in New York City, we are 
proud to show up like a bank headquartered in San Francisco.
STATE OF ALABAMA
JPMorganChase has provided banking 
and financial services to consumers, 
businesses and vital institutions across 
Alabama since 1973, and today we 
proudly bank Auburn University along 
with other colleges across the state. 
We’ve helped support the state’s economy by financing the construction of 
manufacturing, wholesale distribution 
and recycling facilities, as well as the 
development of more than 650 affordable housing units. Our funding has 
been wide ranging and had a positive 
impact on local economies. In Foley – 
one of the fastest-growing cities in 
the United States and a place where 
we plan to expand our branch presence 
Our Corporate Responsibility Management team joined our nonprofit partner Union Square Foundation 
for a walking tour of the neighborhood.

next year – we invested $2.6 million 
through New Markets Tax Credits to 
the Coastal Alabama Farmers and 
Fishermens Market, which helped 
it grow to host 30 vendors, two retail 
stores and a wholesale distribution 
facility for vendors to sell local and 
fresh seafood, produce and meats.
Five years ago, we opened our first 
bank branch in Alabama, creating a 
new opportunity for us to connect with 
consumers and to share insights 
gained from JPMorganChase Institute 
research. Earlier this year, the Institute 
published a report on how small businesses outside of metropolitan areas, 
like those beyond the boundaries of 
Alabama’s cities, fare in scaling to 
$1 million in annual revenue – a key 
milestone of business development 
and sustainability.
Moved by the countless stories we 
heard from Alabamians eager to utilize 
our branches’ resources – and with the 
support of partners, including the 
Huntsville mayor and members of 
Congress – we’ve grown our banking 
network to include 11 branches statewide, with plans to triple that number 
and hire an additional 170 bankers 
by 2030.
While our branch network’s expansion 
will help Alabamians access tools to 
bolster their financial health and 
even launch a company, we know the 
importance of working across sectors 
to develop community infrastructure 
aligned with these goals. To do so, 
we have supported nonprofits, providing technical assistance and community development finance throughout 
the state through partners like 
Appalachian Community Capital, the 
Southern Capital Project, Neighborhood Concepts and the Alabama Small 
Business Development Initiative.
Because despite being a bank headquartered in New York City, we are 
proud to show up like a bank headquartered in Alabama.
THE WORK AHEAD
Actions speak louder than words. In 
our branches and offices, with our 
clients, customers and community 
partners, and through innovative products and services developed to help 
make it easier for people to generate 
wealth, we are focused on walking the 
walk to be the bank for every community we serve.
Make no mistake, this work isn’t charity. 
We place a premium on Corporate 
Responsibility’s investments as 
important contributors to business 
growth and our trusted brand. The 
reality that the firm can’t succeed if 
communities are not strong means 
it is a business imperative to foster productive relationships, understand the 
ins and outs of community dynamics, 
provide excellent services to meet customers’ needs and work to tackle the 
problems holding communities back.
In each market, we are reaching into 
our toolkit of resources and expertise 
to implement strategies that will help 
advance economic growth. We know 
there’s no silver bullet – that’s why the 
work ahead looks different in each 
place, reflecting the unique nature of 
the communities where we are lucky 
enough to be included. The throughline 
of our approach is bringing businesses, 
governments and nonprofits together 
to take big, ambitious ideas and work 
to turn them into results. Time and 
again, it is our experience that these 
types of cross-sector collaboration 
and buy-in are the key ingredients for 
meaningful impact at scale. 
The business and community 
outcomes speak for themselves.

accepted the Firm’s tender of its 37.2 million Visa 
Class B-1 common shares in exchange for a 
combination of Visa Class B-2 common shares and 
Visa Class C common shares (“Visa C shares”), 
resulting in a $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa 
shares recorded in the second quarter of 2024. As of 
September 30, 2024, the Firm had disposed of all of its 
Visa C shares through sales and through a 
contribution to the Firm’s Foundation. Refer to Market 
Risk Management on pages 141–149, and Notes 2 and

year-to-date results include the twelve-month impact 
of First Republic compared with eight months in the 
prior-year period. Where meaningful to the results, this 
is referred to in this Form 10-K as the "timing impact" 
of First Republic. Refer to Notes 6 and 34 for additional 
information.
Comparisons noted in the sections below are for the 
full year of 2024 versus the full year of 2023, unless 
otherwise specified.
Firmwide overview

for 2024, up 18%, earnings per share of $19.75, ROE of 
18% and ROTCE of 22%.
• Total net revenue was $177.6 billion, up 12%, 
reflecting: 
– Net interest income (“NII”) of $92.6 billion, up 4%, 
driven by the impact of balance sheet actions, 
primarily reinvestments in the investment 
securities portfolio, higher revolving balances in 
Card Services, the timing impact of First Republic, 
higher wholesale deposit balances, and higher 
Markets net interest income, largely offset by 
deposit margin compression across the lines of 
business and lower average deposit balances in 
CCB. NII excluding Markets was $92.4 billion, up 
3%. 
– Noninterest revenue (“NIR”) was $85.0 billion, up 
23%, predominantly driven by a $7.9 billion net 
gain related to Visa shares recorded in the second 
quarter of 2024, higher asset management fees in 
AWM and CCB, higher investment banking fees, 
and lower net investment securities losses in 
Treasury and CIO.
The prior year included the estimated bargain 
purchase gain of $2.8 billion associated with First 
Republic.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

• Noninterest expense was $91.8 billion, up 5%, driven 
by higher compensation expense, including higher 
revenue-related compensation and growth in the 
number of employees, as well as a $1.0 billion 
contribution of Visa shares to the JPMorgan Chase 
Foundation recorded in the second quarter of 2024, 
partially offset by lower FDIC-related expense, 
reflecting a $2.9 billion special assessment 
recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared 
with a $725 million increase to the FDIC special 
assessment recognized in the first quarter of 2024. 
• The provision for credit losses was $10.7 billion, 
reflecting $8.6 billion of net charge-offs and a net 
addition to the allowance for credit losses of $2.0 
billion. Net charge-offs increased by $2.4 billion, 
driven by Card Services, reflecting the seasoning of 
vintages originated in recent years, credit 
normalization, and balance growth. The net addition 
to the allowance for credit losses included a net 
addition of $2.1 billion in consumer, driven by Card 
Services, and a net reduction of $19 million in 
wholesale.
The provision in the prior year was $9.3 billion, 
reflecting $6.2 billion of net charge-offs and a $3.1 
billion net addition to the allowance for credit losses.
• The total allowance for credit losses was $26.9 
billion at December 31, 2024. The Firm had an 
allowance for loan losses to retained loans coverage 
ratio of 1.87%, compared with 1.75% in the prior year.
• The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $9.3 
billion at December 31, 2024, up 22%, driven by 
higher wholesale nonaccrual loans, which reflected 
downgrades in Real Estate, concentrated in Office, 
partially offset by lower consumer nonaccrual loans, 
which included loan sales. Refer to Wholesale Credit 
Portfolio and Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 
126–136 and pages 120–125, respectively, for 
additional information.
• Firmwide average loans of $1.3 trillion were up 6%, 
driven by higher loans across the lines of business. 
• Firmwide average deposits of $2.4 trillion were up 
1%, reflecting:
– net inflows in Payments and net issuances of 
structured notes in Markets,
– the timing impact of First Republic, and
– growth in balances in new and existing client 
accounts in AWM,
predominantly offset by
– a decline in CCB primarily driven by a decrease in 
balances in existing accounts due to increased 
customer spending.
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 108–
115 for additional information.
Selected capital and other metrics
• CET1 capital was $275.5 billion, and the 
Standardized and Advanced CET1 ratios were 15.7% 
and 15.8%, respectively.
• SLR was 6.1%.
• TBVPS grew 13.0%, ending 2024 at $97.30.
• As of December 31, 2024, the Firm had eligible endof-period High Quality Liquid Assets (“HQLA”) of 
approximately $834 billion and unencumbered 
marketable securities with a fair value of 
approximately $594 billion, resulting in 
approximately $1.4 trillion of liquidity sources. Refer 
to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 108–115 for 
additional information.
Refer to Consolidated Results of Operations and 
Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 59–62 
and pages 63–65, respectively, for a further discussion 
of the Firm's results, including the provision for credit 
losses, and Note 34 for additional information on the 
First Republic acquisition.
Pre-provision profit, ROTCE, TCE, TBVPS, NII and NIR 
excluding Markets, and total net revenue on a 
managed basis are non-GAAP financial measures. 
Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 67–69

1, 6, 14 and 25 for additional information.

recorded in the second quarter of 2024. Refer to Notes 2 and 6

the year ended December 31, 2023 associated with the First 
Republic acquisition. Refer to Notes 6 and 34 for additional 
information.
2024 compared with 2023
Investment banking fees increased, reflecting in CIB 
the benefit of favorable market conditions, which 
resulted in:
• higher debt underwriting fees predominantly driven 
by higher industry-wide issuances in leveraged 
loans, and in high-grade and high-yield bonds, 
• higher equity underwriting fees driven by higher 
industry-wide fees and wallet share gains in IPOs, 
and in follow-on and convertible securities offerings, 
and
• higher advisory fees driven by higher industry-wide 
mergers and acquisitions (“M&A”) activity and wallet 
share gains.
Refer to CIB segment results on pages 77–83 and Note 
6 for additional information.
Principal transactions revenue increased driven by 
CIB, reflecting:
• higher Equity Markets revenue in Prime Finance and 
Equity Derivatives,
predominantly offset by
• lower Fixed Income Markets revenue, reflecting the 
net impact of declines in revenue across macro 
businesses and higher revenue in Securitized 
Products.
Principal transactions revenue in CIB generally has 
offsets across other revenue lines, including net 
interest income. The Firm assesses the performance 
of its Markets business on a total net revenue basis.
The increase in CIB was partially offset by a net 
decrease in Corporate, reflecting lower revenue in 
Treasury and CIO, and gains compared with a net loss 
on certain legacy private equity investments in the 
prior year.
Refer to CIB segment and Corporate results on pages 
77–83 and pages 88–90, respectively, and Note 6 for 
additional information.
Lending- and deposit-related fees increased, 
reflecting, in CIB, higher deposit-related fees, including 
cash management fees in Payments, on higher 
volume; and higher lending-related fees, including loan 
commitment fees. These factors were largely offset by 
a decline in the amortization of the fair value discount 
on certain acquired lending-related commitments 
associated with First Republic, primarily in AWM, as 
certain of the commitments have expired. 
Refer to CIB and AWM segment results on pages 77–
83 and pages 84–87, respectively, and Note 6 for 
additional information.
Asset management fees increased, reflecting, in 
AWM and CCB, higher average market levels and net 
inflows, as well as higher performance fees in AWM; 
and in CCB, the timing impact of First Republic. Refer 
to CCB and AWM segment results on pages 73–76 and 
pages 84–87, respectively, and Note 6 for additional 
information. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

Commissions and other fees increased, 
predominantly due to higher brokerage commissions 
and fees on higher volume, and higher custody fees, in 
both CIB and AWM, as well as higher annuity sales 
commissions in CCB. Refer to CCB, CIB and AWM 
segment results on pages 73–76, pages 77–83 and 
pages 84–87, respectively, and Note 6 for additional 
information. 
Investment securities losses decreased, reflecting 
lower losses on sales of securities, primarily U.S. 
Treasuries and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, 
associated with repositioning the investment 
securities portfolio in Treasury and CIO. Refer to 
Corporate results on pages 88–90 and Note 10 for 
additional information.
Mortgage fees and related income increased in Home 
Lending, reflecting higher production revenue, which 
included the timing impact of First Republic. Refer to 
CCB segment results on pages 73–76, and Note 6 and 
15 for additional information.
Card income increased, reflecting higher net 
interchange on increased debit and credit card sales 
volume, as well as higher annual fees in CCB, partially 
offset by an increase in amortization related to new 
account origination costs. Refer to CCB segment 
results on pages 73–76 and Note 6 for additional 
information.
Other income increased, reflecting: 
• in Corporate: 
– the $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa shares 
recorded in the second quarter of 2024,
partially offset by
– the absence of the prior-year $2.8 billion 
estimated bargain purchase gain associated with 
the First Republic acquisition, and 
• in CIB:
– the impact of the adoption of updates to the 
Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit 
Structures guidance effective January 1, 2024, 
resulting in the amortization of certain of the 
Firm's alternative energy tax-oriented investments 
previously recognized in other income which is 
now recognized in income tax expense.
Both periods included impairment losses related to 
certain equity investments. 
The prior year included a gain of $339 million on the 
original minority interest in China International Fund 
Management ("CIFM"), partially offset by net 
investment valuation losses, both in AWM.
Refer to AWM segment results on pages 84–87 for 
additional information on CIFM; Notes 1, 6, 14 and 25 
for additional information on the adoption of updates 
to the Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit 
Structures guidance; Notes 2 and 6 for additional 
information on Visa shares; and Notes 6 and 34 for 
additional information on the First Republic 
acquisition.
Net interest income increased driven by the impact of 
balance sheet actions, primarily reinvestments in the 
investment securities portfolio, higher revolving 
balances in Card Services, the timing impact of First 
Republic, higher wholesale deposit balances and 
higher Markets net interest income. These factors 
were largely offset by deposit margin compression 
across the lines of business and lower average deposit 
balances in CCB.
The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.5 
trillion, up $212 billion, and the yield was 5.50%, up 36 
bps. The net yield on these assets, on an FTE basis, 
was 2.63%, a decrease of 7 bps. The net yield 
excluding Markets was 3.84%, relatively flat when 
compared to the prior year.
Refer to the Consolidated average balance sheets, 
interest and rates schedule on pages 322–326 for 
additional information. Net yield excluding Markets is a 
non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to Explanation and 
Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP 
Financial Measures on pages 67–69 for an additional 
discussion of net yield excluding Markets.

2024 compared with 2023 
The provision for credit losses was $10.7 billion, 
reflecting $8.6 billion of net charge-offs and a $2.0 
billion net addition to the allowance for credit losses. 
Net charge-offs included $7.8 billion in consumer, 
predominantly driven by Card Services, reflecting the 
seasoning of vintages originated in recent years, credit 
normalization and balance growth, and $0.8 billion in 
wholesale, primarily in Real Estate, largely 
concentrated in Office.
The net addition to the allowance for credit losses 
consisted of:
• $2.1 billion in consumer, reflecting:
– a $2.2 billion net addition in Card Services, 
predominantly driven by loan growth, reflecting 
higher revolving balances, including the seasoning 
of vintages originated in recent years, 
partially offset by
– a $125 million net reduction in Home Lending in 
the first quarter of 2024, and 
• a net reduction of $19 million in wholesale, 
reflecting: 
– changes in certain macroeconomic variables, an 
update to loss assumptions on certain loans in 
Markets, and a reduction due to charge-offs 
largely from collateral-dependent loans, 
predominantly offset by 
– net downgrade activity, primarily in Real Estate, 
and the impact of incorporating the First Republic 
portfolio into the Firm’s modeled credit loss 
estimates in the second quarter of 2024. 
The provision in the prior year was $9.3 billion, 
reflecting net charge-offs of $6.2 billion and a $3.1 
billion net addition to the allowance for credit losses, 
which included $1.2 billion to establish the allowance 
for the First Republic loans and lending-related 
commitments in the second quarter of 2023.

2024 compared with 2023
Compensation expense increased driven by:
• higher revenue-related compensation across the 
LOBs,
• growth in the number of employees across the LOBs 
and Corporate, primarily in front office and 
technology, and
• the impact of First Republic, predominantly in CCB, 
reflecting timing and the classification of the prioryear expense, which was recognized in other 
expense in Corporate in the second quarter of 2023 
as the individuals associated with First Republic 
were not employees of the Firm until July 2023.
Noncompensation expense decreased as a result of:
• lower FDIC-related expense recognized in 
Corporate, which included the impact of a $2.9 
billion special assessment recognized in the fourth 
quarter of 2023, compared with a $725 million 
increase to the FDIC special assessment recognized 
in the first quarter of 2024, and
• lower legal expense, reflecting the net impact of 
declines in CCB, CIB and Corporate, and an increase 
in AWM,
predominantly offset by
• a $1.0 billion contribution of Visa shares to the 
JPMorgan Chase Foundation recorded in the second 
quarter of 2024 in Corporate,
• higher investments in technology in the businesses, 
as well as marketing, predominantly in CCB,
• higher occupancy expense, which included the 
impact of net additions to the Firm's properties,
• higher distribution fees in AWM and brokerage 
expense in CIB, and
• the timing impact associated with First Republic, 
offset by the alignment of expense to compensation 
expense, as noted above.
Refer to Notes 2 and 6 for additional information on 
Visa shares; Note 6 for additional information on other 
expense; and Note 34 for additional information on the 
First Republic acquisition.

Refer to Notes 1, 6, 14 and 25 for additional information.
2024 compared with 2023 
The effective tax rate increased predominantly driven 
by:
• the adoption of updates to the Accounting for 
Investments in Tax Credit Structures guidance on 
January 1, 2024, and
• a higher level of pretax income and changes in the 
mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal, 
state and local taxes, including the impact of the net 
gain on Visa shares and the contribution of Visa 
shares to the JPMorgan Chase Foundation recorded 
in the second quarter of 2024.
The prior year included the impact to income tax 
expense associated with the First Republic acquisition 
that was reflected in the estimated bargain purchase 
gain, and an income tax benefit related to the 
finalization of certain income tax regulations, both of 
which resulted in a reduction in the Firm's effective tax 
rate.

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks 
decreased driven by higher investment securities in 
Treasury and CIO, and Markets activities in CIB.
Federal funds sold and securities purchased under 
resale agreements increased driven by Markets, 
reflecting higher client-driven market-making 
activities.
Securities borrowed increased driven by Markets, 
reflecting a higher demand for securities to cover 
short positions.
Refer to Note 11 for additional information on securities 
purchased under resale agreements and securities 
borrowed.
Trading assets increased predominantly due to higher 
levels of debt and equity instruments in Markets 
related to client-driven market-making activities. Refer 
to Notes 2 and 5 for additional information.
Investment securities increased due to:
• higher available-for-sale ("AFS") securities, reflecting 
net purchases, primarily U.S. Treasuries and nonU.S. government debt securities, partially offset by 
maturities and paydowns, and
• lower held to-maturity (“HTM”) securities driven by 
maturities and paydowns.
Refer to Corporate results on pages 88–90, 
Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 140, 
and Notes 2 and 10 for additional information.
Loans increased, reflecting:
• higher outstanding balances in Card Services driven 
by growth in new accounts and normalization of 
revolving balances,
• higher wholesale loans in CIB, and
• higher securities-based lending in AWM due to 
higher client demand,
partially offset by
• a decline in Home Lending as paydowns and loan 
sales outpaced originations.
The allowance for loan losses increased, reflecting a 
net addition to the allowance for loan losses of $1.9 
billion, consisting of:
• $2.1 billion net addition in consumer, primarily in 
Card Services, predominantly driven by loan growth, 
reflecting higher revolving balances, including the 
seasoning of vintages originated in recent years, 
partially offset by a net reduction in Home Lending in 
the first quarter of 2024, and
• a net reduction of $176 million in wholesale, 
reflecting:
– changes in certain macroeconomic variables, an 
update to loss assumptions on certain loans in 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

Markets, and a reduction due to charge-offs 
largely from collateral-dependent loans, 
predominantly offset by
– net downgrade activity, primarily in Real Estate, 
and the impact of incorporating the First Republic 
portfolio into the Firm’s modeled credit loss 
estimates in the second quarter of 2024.
There was also a $128 million net addition to the 
allowance for lending-related commitments 
recognized in other liabilities on the Consolidated 
balance sheets. 
Refer to Consolidated Results of Operations and Credit 
and Investment Risk Management on pages 59–62 
and pages 117–140, respectively, Critical Accounting 
Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 161–164, and 
Notes 2, 3, 12 and 13 for additional information on loans 
and the total allowance for credit losses. 
Accrued interest and accounts receivable decreased 
primarily driven by lower receivables in Payments 
related to the timing of processing payment activities, 
due to December 31, 2023 falling on a weekend, as well 
as lower client receivables related to client-driven 
activities in Markets. 
Premises and equipment increased primarily as a 
result of the construction-in-process associated with 
the Firm's headquarters, and purchases of properties. 
Refer to Notes 16 and 18 for additional information.
Goodwill, MSRs and other intangibles: Refer to Note 
15 for additional information.
Other assets increased primarily due to higher cash 
collateral placed with central counterparties ("CCP") in 
Markets, the impact of the adoption of updates to the 
Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures 
guidance effective January 1, 2024, and higher auto 
operating lease assets in CCB. Refer to Notes 1, 6, 14 
and 25 for additional information on updates to the 
accounting guidance.

Deposits increased, reflecting:
• an increase in CIB due to net inflows predominantly 
in Payments, largely offset by net maturities of 
structured notes in Markets,
• an increase in AWM as a result of growth in balances 
in new and existing client accounts, reflecting the 
impact of higher-yielding product offerings, largely 
offset by continued migration into other 
investments, and
• a decline in CCB primarily driven by a decrease in 
balances in existing accounts due to increased 
customer spending and migration into higheryielding investments, predominantly offset by new 
accounts.
Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or 
sold under repurchase agreements increased driven 
by Markets, reflecting higher client-driven marketmaking activities and higher secured financing of 
trading assets.
Short-term borrowings increased driven by Markets, 
reflecting net issuance of structured notes due to 
client demand, and higher financing requirements.
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 108–115 
for additional information on deposits, federal funds 
purchased and securities loaned or sold under 
repurchase agreements, and short-term borrowings; 
Notes 2 and 17 for deposits; and Note 11 for federal 
funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under 
repurchase agreements.
Trading liabilities increased due to client-driven 
market-making activities primarily in Fixed Income 
Markets, which resulted in higher levels of short 
positions in debt instruments. Refer to Notes 2 and 5 
for additional information.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

Accounts payable and other liabilities decreased 
primarily driven by lower payables in Payments related 
to the timing of processing payment activities, due to 
December 31, 2023 falling on a weekend, as well as 
lower client payables related to client-driven activities 
in Markets, partially offset by the impact of the 
adoption of updates to the Accounting for Investments 
in Tax Credit Structures guidance effective January 1, 
2024. Refer to Note 19 for additional information on 
accounts payable; and Notes 1, 6, 14 and 25 for 
additional information on updates to the accounting 
guidance.
Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs 
increased driven by the issuance of credit card 
securitizations in Treasury and CIO, and activity in 
municipal bond vehicles in CIB.
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 108–115; 
and Notes 14 and 28 for additional information on 
Firm-sponsored VIEs and loan securitization trusts.
Long-term debt increased, primarily driven by:
• net issuances of structured notes in Markets due to 
client demand,
partially offset by
• a decline in Treasury and CIO, reflecting the net 
impact of lower FHLB advances and higher longterm debt from net issuances.
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 108–115 
and Note 34 for additional information on the First 
Republic acquisition.
Stockholders’ equity increased, reflecting:
• net income,
largely offset by 
• the impact of capital actions, including repurchases 
of common shares, the declaration of common and 
preferred stock dividends, and net redemption of 
preferred stock, and 
• net unrealized losses in AOCI, including the impact 
of higher interest rates on cash flow hedges in 
Treasury and CIO. 
Refer to Consolidated Statements of changes in 
stockholders’ equity on page 175, Capital Actions on 
page 105, and Note 24 for additional information.

Operating activities 
JPMorganChase’s operating assets and liabilities 
primarily support the Firm’s lending and capital 
markets activities. These assets and liabilities can vary 
significantly in the normal course of business due to 
the amount and timing of cash flows, which are 
affected by client-driven and risk management 
activities and market conditions. The Firm believes 
that cash flows from operations, available cash and 
other liquidity sources, and its capacity to generate 
cash through secured and unsecured sources, are 
sufficient to meet its operating liquidity needs.
• In 2024, cash used resulted from higher trading 
assets and higher securities borrowed, largely offset 
by net income. 
• In 2023, cash provided primarily reflected net 
income, lower other assets, and accrued interest and 
accounts receivable, predominantly offset by higher 
trading assets, lower accounts payable and other 
liabilities, and higher securities borrowed.
Investing activities
The Firm’s investing activities predominantly include 
originating held-for-investment loans, investing in the 
investment securities portfolio and other short-term 
instruments.
• In 2024, cash used resulted from net purchases of 
investment securities, net loan originations and 
higher securities purchased under resale 
agreements, partially offset by proceeds from sales 
and securitizations of loans held-for-investment. 
• In 2023, cash provided resulted from net proceeds 
from investment securities, proceeds from sales and 
securitizations of loans held-for-investment, and 
lower securities purchased under resale 
agreements, largely offset by net originations of 
loans and net cash used in the First Republic Bank 
acquisition.
Financing activities
The Firm’s financing activities include acquiring 
customer deposits and issuing long-term debt and 
preferred stock.
• In 2024, cash provided primarily reflected higher 
securities loaned or sold under repurchase 
agreements and net proceeds from long- and shortterm borrowings, partially offset by net redemption 
of preferred stock.
• In 2023, cash used reflected lower deposits, which 
included the impact of the repayment of the 
deposits provided to First Republic Bank by the 
consortium of large U.S. banks that the Firm 
assumed as part of the First Republic acquisition, 
partially offset by higher securities loaned under 
repurchase agreements and net proceeds from 
long- and short-term borrowings.
• For both periods, cash was used for repurchases of 
common stock and cash dividends on common and 
preferred stock.

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Non-GAAP financial measures
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial 
Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP; these 
financial statements appear on pages 172–176. That 
presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, 
provides the reader with an understanding of the 
Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from 
year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s 
performance with the U.S. GAAP financial statements 
of other companies.
In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a 
reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, 
including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; 
these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP 
financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results 
of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s 
definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with 
the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain 
reclassifications to present total net revenue for the 
Firm as a whole, and for each of the reportable 
business segments and Corporate, on an FTE basis. 
Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive 
tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in 
the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable 
investments and securities. These financial measures 
allow management to assess the comparability of 
revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable 
and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income 
tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded 
within income tax expense. These adjustments have 
no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a 
whole or by each of the lines of business and 
Corporate.
Management also uses certain non-GAAP financial 
measures at the Firm and business-segment levels 
because these other non-GAAP financial measures 
provide information to investors about the underlying 
operational performance and trends of the Firm or of 
the particular business segment, as the case may be, 
and therefore facilitate a comparison of the Firm or the 
business segment with the performance of its relevant 
competitors. Refer to Business Segment & Corporate 
Results on pages 70–90 for additional information on 
these non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial 
measures used by the Firm may not be comparable to 
similarly named non-GAAP financial measures used by 
other companies. 
The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm’s reported U.S. GAAP results to managed 
basis.

Net interest income, net yield, and noninterest 
revenue excluding Markets
In addition to reviewing net interest income, net yield, 
and noninterest revenue on a managed basis, 
management also reviews these metrics excluding 
Markets, as shown below. Markets consists of CIB’s 
Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. These 
metrics, which exclude Markets, are non-GAAP 
financial measures. Management reviews these 
metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s 
lending, investing (including asset-liability 
management) and deposit-raising activities, apart 
from any volatility associated with Markets activities. In 
addition, management also assesses Markets 
business performance on a total revenue basis as 
offsets may occur across revenue lines. Management 
believes that these measures provide investors and 
analysts with alternative measures to analyze the 
revenue trends of the Firm.

Calculation of certain U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP financial 
measures
Certain U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are 
calculated as follows:
Book value per share (“BVPS”)
Common stockholders’ equity at period-end /
Common shares at period-end
Overhead ratio
Total noninterest expense / Total net revenue
ROA
Reported net income / Total average assets
ROE
Net income* / Average common stockholders’ equity
ROTCE
Net income* / Average tangible common equity
TBVPS
Tangible common equity at period-end / Common shares at 
period-end
* Represents net income applicable to common equity
In addition, the Firm reviews other non-GAAP 
measures such as:
• Adjusted expense, which represents noninterest 
expense excluding Firmwide legal expense, and
• Pre-provision profit, which represents total net 
revenue less total noninterest expense.
Management believes that these measures help 
investors to understand the effect of these items on 
reported results and provide an alternative 
presentation of the Firm’s performance.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS
TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ 
equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other 
than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common 
equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares 
at period-end. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the 
Firm’s use of equity. 
The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity to TCE.

BUSINESS SEGMENT & CORPORATE RESULTS
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. Effective in the second quarter of 2024, the Firm reorganized its reportable 
business segments by combining the former Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial Banking business 
segments to form one reportable segment, the Commercial & Investment Bank (“CIB”). As a result of the 
reorganization, the Firm has three reportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking, Commercial & 
Investment Bank, and Asset & Wealth Management – with the remaining activities in Corporate. 
The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer 
served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee, 
whose members act collectively as the Firm’s chief operating decision maker. Segment results are presented on a 
managed basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, on 
pages 67–69 for a definition of managed basis.
The following table depicts the Firm’s reportable business segments.
Description of business segment reporting methodology
Results of the reportable business segments are 
intended to present each segment as if it were a standalone business. The management reporting process 
that derives business segment results includes the 
allocation of certain income and expense items. The 
Firm periodically assesses the assumptions, 
methodologies and reporting classifications used for 
segment reporting, and therefore further refinements 
may be implemented in future periods. The Firm also 
assesses the level of capital required for each LOB on 
at least an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide 
various business metrics which are utilized by the Firm 
and its investors and analysts in assessing 
performance.
Revenue sharing 
When business segments or businesses within each 
segment join efforts to sell products and services to 
the Firm’s clients and customers, the participating 
businesses may agree to share revenue from those 
transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the 
segment responsible for the related product or 
service, with allocations to the other segments or 
businesses involved in the transaction. The segment 
and business results reflect these revenue-sharing 
agreements.

Expense allocation
Where business segments use services provided by 
Corporate support units, or another business segment, 
the costs of those services are allocated to the 
respective business segments. The expense is 
generally allocated based on the actual cost and use of 
services provided. In contrast, certain costs and 
investments related to Corporate that are not currently 
utilized by any LOB are not allocated to the business 
segments and are retained in Corporate. Expense 
retained in Corporate generally includes costs that 
would not be incurred if the segments were standalone businesses, and other items not solely aligned 
with a particular reportable business segment.
Funds transfer pricing 
Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which 
the Firm allocates interest income and expense to the 
LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary 
interest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO.
The funds transfer pricing process considers the 
interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets 
and liabilities and off-balance sheet products. 
Periodically, the methodology and assumptions 
utilized in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect 
economic conditions and other factors, which may 
impact the allocation of net interest income to the 
segments. Effective in the fourth quarter of 2024, the 
Firm updated its FTP with respect to consumer 
deposits, which resulted in an increase in the funding 
benefit reflected within CCB’s net interest income that 
is fully offset in Corporate, with no effect on the Firm’s 
net interest income.
As a result of higher average interest rates, the cost of 
funds for assets and the FTP benefit earned for 
liabilities have generally increased in the current year, 
impacting the net interest income of the business 
segments. During the period ended December 31, 
2024, this has resulted in a higher cost of funds for 
loans and Markets activities. In addition, rates paid to 
deposit holders increased more than the FTP benefit 
increase during the year, resulting in deposit margin 
compression.
Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs 
and Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain 
revenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages 
these risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign 
exchange rate movements related to the transferred 
risk in its results. Refer to Market Risk Management on 
page 149 for additional information.
Debt expense and preferred stock dividend allocation
As part of the FTP process, almost all of the cost of the 
credit spread component of outstanding unsecured 
long-term debt and preferred stock dividends is 
allocated to the reportable business segments, while 
the balance of the cost is retained in Corporate. The 
methodology to allocate the cost of unsecured longterm debt and preferred stock dividends to the 
business segments is aligned with the relevant 
regulatory capital requirements and funding needs of 
the LOBs, as applicable. The allocated cost of 
unsecured long-term debt is included in a business 
segment’s net interest income, and net income is 
reduced by preferred stock dividends, to arrive at a 
business segment’s net income applicable to common 
equity. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 
97–107 for additional information.
Capital allocation 
The amount of capital assigned to each LOB and 
Corporate is referred to as equity. The Firm’s current 
equity allocation methodology incorporates Basel III 
Standardized risk-weighted assets (“RWA”) and the 
global systemically important banks (“GSIB”) 
surcharge, both under rules currently in effect, as well 
as a simulation of capital depletion in a severe stress 
environment. At least annually, the assumptions, 
judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital 
are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to 
the LOBs and Corporate may change. Refer to Line of 
business and Corporate equity on page 104 for 
additional information on capital allocation.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

 2024 compared with 2023
Net income was $17.6 billion, down 17%.
Net revenue was $71.5 billion, up 2%.
Net interest income was $54.9 billion, flat when 
compared with the prior year, reflecting:
• lower NII in Banking & Wealth Management ("BWM"), 
predominantly driven by deposit margin 
compression and lower average deposits,
offset by
• higher Card Services NII, predominantly driven by 
higher revolving balances, and
• the timing impact of First Republic in Home Lending.
Noninterest revenue was $16.6 billion, up 10%, 
predominantly driven by:
• higher asset management fees reflecting higher 
average market levels, including the timing impact 
of First Republic and, to a lesser extent, net inflows, 
as well as higher commissions from annuity sales in 
BWM,
• higher card income, driven by higher net 
interchange reflecting increased debit and credit 
card sales volume, and higher annual fees, partially 
offset by an increase in amortization related to new 
account origination costs, as well as
• higher production revenue in Home Lending, 
including the timing impact of First Republic. 
Refer to Note 6 for additional information on card 
income, asset management fees, and commissions 
and other fees; and Critical Accounting Estimates on 
pages 161–164 for additional information on the credit 
card rewards liability. 
Refer to Executive Overview on page 54 and Note 34 
for additional information on First Republic.
Noninterest expense was $38.0 billion, up 9%, 
reflecting First Republic-related expense that was 
aligned to CCB from Corporate starting in the third 
quarter of 2023, impacting both compensation and 
noncompensation expense.
The increase in expense also reflected:
• higher compensation expense, largely driven by 
higher revenue-related compensation 
predominantly for advisors and bankers, and an 
increase in the number of employees, including in 
technology, and
• higher noncompensation expense, largely driven by 
continued investments in technology and marketing, 
as well as higher operating losses, partially offset by 
lower legal expense.
The provision for credit losses was $10.0 billion, 
reflecting:
• net charge-offs of $7.9 billion, up $2.6 billion, 
including $2.4 billion in Card Services, reflecting the 
seasoning of vintages originated in recent years, 
credit normalization and balance growth, and
• a $2.0 billion net addition to the allowance for credit 
losses, consisting of:
– $2.2 billion in Card Services, predominantly driven 
by loan growth, reflecting higher revolving 
balances, including the seasoning of vintages 
originated in recent years,
partially offset by
– a $125 million net reduction in Home Lending, 
primarily due to improvements in the outlook for 
home prices in the first quarter of 2024. 
The provision in the prior year was $6.9 billion, 
reflecting net charge-offs of $5.3 billion, a $1.2 billion 
net addition to the allowance for credit losses, 
predominantly driven by Card Services, and a $408 
million net addition to the allowance for credit losses 
to establish the allowance for the First Republic loans 
and lending-related commitments in the second 
quarter of 2023.
Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on 
pages 117–140 and Allowance for Credit Losses on 
pages 137–139 for a further discussion of the credit 
portfolios and the allowance for credit losses.

2024 compared with 2023
Net income was $24.8 billion, up 23%.
Net revenue was $70.1 billion, up 9%.
Banking & Payments revenue was $35.3 billion, up 11%.
• Investment Banking revenue was $9.6 billion, up 
36%. Investment Banking fees were up 37%, driven 
by higher fees across products. The Firm ranked #1 
for Global Investment Banking fees, according to 
Dealogic.
– Debt underwriting fees were $4.1 billion, up 55%, 
predominantly driven by higher industry-wide 
issuances in leveraged loans, and in high-grade 
and high-yield bonds.
– Equity underwriting fees were $1.7 billion, up 47%, 
driven by increased industry-wide fees and wallet 
share gains in IPOs, and in follow-on and 
convertible securities offerings.
– Advisory fees were $3.3 billion, up 17%, driven by 
increased industry-wide M&A activity and wallet 
share gains.
• Payments revenue was $18.1 billion, up 1%, driven by 
fee growth on higher volumes as well as higher 
average deposits, predominantly offset by deposit 
margin compression, reflecting higher rates paid, 
and higher deposit-related client credits. 
• Lending revenue was $7.5 billion, up 8%, 
predominantly driven by the impacts of higher rates 
and the First Republic acquisition.
Markets & Securities Services revenue was $34.8 
billion, up 7%. Markets revenue was $30.0 billion, up 
7%.
• Equity Markets revenue was $9.9 billion, up 13%, 
driven by higher revenue in Equity Derivatives and 
Prime Finance.
• Fixed Income Markets revenue was $20.1 billion, up 
5%, driven by higher revenue in the Securitized 
Products Group, Currencies & Emerging Markets, 
and Credit, largely offset by lower revenue in Rates 
and Commodities. 
• Securities Services revenue was $5.1 billion, up 7%, 
predominantly driven by fee growth on higher client 
activity and market levels.
• Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $244 
million, compared with a loss of $280 million in the 
prior year.
Noninterest expense was $35.4 billion, up 4%, driven 
by higher compensation expense, including revenuerelated compensation and an increase in the number 
of employees, as well as higher technology and 
brokerage expense partially offset by lower legal 
expense.
The provision for credit losses was $762 million, 
reflecting: 
• net charge-offs of $617 million, primarily in Real 
Estate, largely concentrated in Office, and
• a $145 million net addition to the allowance for credit 
losses, driven by
– net downgrade activity, primarily in Real Estate, 
and the impact of incorporating the First Republic 
portfolio into the Firm's modeled credit loss 
estimates in the second quarter of 2024, 
predominantly offset by
– changes in certain macroeconomic variables, an 
update to loss assumptions on certain loans in 
Markets, and a reduction due to charge-offs 
predominantly from collateral-dependent loans. 
The provision in the prior year was $2.1 billion, 
reflecting a $1.5 billion net addition to the allowance for 
credit losses, which included $608 million to establish 
the allowance for the First Republic loans and lendingrelated commitments in the second quarter of 2023, 
and net charge-offs of $588 million.

Markets revenue
The following table summarizes selected income 
statement data for the Markets businesses. Markets 
includes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity 
Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal 
transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as 
well as net interest income. The Firm assesses its 
Markets business performance on a total revenue 
basis, as offsets generally occur across revenue line 
items. For example, securities that generate net 
interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives 
that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions 
revenue. Refer to Notes 6 and 7 for a description of the 
composition of these income statement line items. 
Principal transactions reflects revenue on financial 
instruments and commodities transactions that arise 
from client-driven market-making activity. Principal 
transactions revenue includes amounts recognized 
upon executing new transactions with market 
participants, as well as “inventory-related revenue,” 
which is revenue recognized from gains and losses on 
derivatives and other instruments that the Firm has 
been holding in anticipation of, or in response to, client 
demand, and changes in the fair value of instruments 
used by the Firm to actively manage the risk exposure 
arising from such inventory. Principal transactions 
revenue recognized upon executing new transactions 
with market participants is affected by many factors 
including the level of client activity, the bid-offer 
spread (which is the difference between the price at 
which a market participant is willing and able to sell an 
instrument to the Firm and the price at which another 
market participant is willing and able to buy it from the 
Firm, and vice versa), market liquidity and 
volatility. These factors are interrelated and sensitive 
to the same factors that drive inventory-related 
revenue, which include general market conditions, 
such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit 
spreads, and equity and commodity prices, as well as 
other macroeconomic conditions.

Loss days(b)

(a) The decline in Equity Markets net interest income was driven by higher funding costs.
(b) Markets consists of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Loss days represent the number of days for which Markets recorded losses in 
total net revenue, which includes revenue related to both trading and non-trading positions. The loss days determined under this measure 
differ from the measure used to determine backtesting gains and losses. Daily backtesting gains and losses include positions in the Firm’s 
Risk Management value-at-risk ("VaR") measure and exclude certain components of total net revenue, which may more than offset 
backtesting gains or losses on a particular day. For more information on daily backtesting gains and losses, refer to the VaR discussion on 
pages 143–145.
(c) In the fourth quarter of 2024, certain net funding costs that were previously allocated to Fixed Income Markets were reclassified to Equity 
Markets. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(a) Includes the amortization of the fair value discount on certain 
acquired lending-related commitments associated with First 
Republic. The discount is deferred in other liabilities and 
recognized on a straight-line basis over the commitment period 
and was largely recognized in 2023 as the commitments were 
generally short term. Refer to Note 34 for additional information.
(b) Includes the gain on the original minority interest in CIFM upon 
the Firm’s acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in the entity.
2024 compared with 2023
Net income was $5.4 billion, up 4%.
Net revenue was $21.6 billion, up 9%. Net interest 
income was $6.6 billion, up 5%. Noninterest revenue 
was $15.0 billion, up 11%.
Revenue from Asset Management was $10.2 billion, up 
11%, driven by: 
• higher asset management fees, reflecting higher 
average market levels and strong net inflows, as well 
• higher performance fees.
The prior year included a gain of $339 million on the 
original minority interest in CIFM upon the Firm’s 
acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in the entity.
Revenue from Global Private Bank was $11.4 billion, up 
7%, driven by: 
• higher noninterest revenue, reflecting:
– higher management fees on strong net inflows and 
higher average market levels, as well as higher 
brokerage fees, 
partially offset by
– a decline in the amortization of the fair value 
discount on certain acquired lending-related 
commitments associated with First Republic that 
have expired, and
• higher net interest income driven by:
– higher average deposits associated with First 
Republic, which were transferred to AWM from 
CCB in the fourth quarter of 2023, as well as wider 
spreads on loans and higher average loans, 
largely offset by
– deposit margin compression reflecting higher 
rates paid.
The prior year included net investment valuation 
losses. 
Noninterest expense was $14.4 billion, up 13%, 
predominantly driven by:
• higher compensation, including revenue-related 
compensation, and continued growth in private 
banking advisor teams, and
• higher distribution fees and legal expense,
The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $68 
million. 
The provision in the prior year was $159 million, 
reflecting a $146 million addition to the allowance for 
credit losses to establish the allowance for the First 
Republic loans and lending-related commitments in 
the second quarter of 2023.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

Asset Management has two high-level measures 
of its overall fund performance.
• Percentage of active mutual fund and active ETF assets under 
management in funds rated 4- or 5-star: Mutual fund rating 
services rank funds based on their risk adjusted performance 
over various periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and 
represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star 
rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. 
A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked 
funds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industrywide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and 
represents the bottom 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. An 
overall Morningstar rating is derived from a weighted average of 
the performance associated with a fund’s three-, five and tenyear (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-
domiciled funds, separate star ratings are provided at the 
individual share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based 
on three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer 
than three years of history are not rated and hence excluded 
from these rankings. All ratings, the assigned peer categories 
and the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced 
from the applicable fund rating provider. Where applicable, the 
fund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. 
dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the 
share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a “primary 
share class” level to represent the star rating of all other funds, 
except for Japan, for which Nomura provides ratings at the fund 
level. The performance data may have been different if all share 
classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of 
future results.
• Percentage of active mutual fund and active ETF assets under 
management in funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, 
three and five years):All quartile rankings, the assigned peer 
categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings 
are sourced from the fund rating providers. Quartile rankings 
are based on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where 
applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset values 
into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on fund 
performance and associated peer rankings at the share class 
level for U.S.-domiciled funds, at a “primary share class” level to 
represent the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and Hong 
Kong SAR funds and at the fund level for all other funds. The 
performance data may have been different if all share classes 
had been included. Past performance is not indicative of future 
results.
“Primary share class” means the C share class for European 
funds and Acc share class for Hong Kong SAR and Taiwan 
funds. If these share classes are not available, the oldest share 
class is used as the primary share class.

(c) Included the net gain related to Visa shares of $7.9 billion 
recorded in the second quarter of 2024. Refer to Notes 2 and 6 
for additional information.
(d) Included a $1.0 billion contribution of Visa shares to the 
JPMorgan Chase Foundation recorded in the second quarter of 
2024. Refer to Notes 2 and 6 for additional information.
(e) The first quarter of 2024 included an increase of $725 million to

estimate of Deposit Insurance Fund losses. The fourth quarter of 
2023 included the $2.9 billion FDIC special assessment.
(f) Included the estimated bargain purchase gain of $2.8 billion for 
the year ended December 31, 2023 associated with the First 
Republic acquisition. Refer to Notes 6 and 34 for additional 
information.
(g) In the second quarter of 2023, substantially all of the expense

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

2024 compared with 2023
Net income was $10.6 billion, compared with $2.8 
billion in the prior year.
Net revenue was $17.4 billion, compared with $8.0 
billion in the prior year.
Net interest income was $9.8 billion, up 24%, driven by 
the impact of balance sheet actions, primarily 
reinvestments in the investment securities portfolio, 
partially offset by the net impact of rates. 
Noninterest revenue was $7.6 billion, compared with 
$132 million in the prior year. Excluding the $7.9 billion 
net gain related to Visa shares recorded in the second 
quarter of 2024 and the prior-year $2.8 billion 
estimated bargain purchase gain associated with the 
First Republic acquisition, revenue was up $2.4 billion, 
predominantly driven by lower investment securities 
losses, primarily on sales of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. 
GSE and government agency MBS, associated with 
repositioning the investment securities portfolio in 
Treasury and CIO. 
Noninterest expense was $4.0 billion, down 29%, 
driven by: 
• a lower FDIC special assessment,
• lower expense associated with the First Republic 
acquisition as the prior year expense in Corporate 
included individuals associated with First Republic 
who were not employees of the Firm until July 2023, 
and this expense was subsequently aligned to the 
appropriate LOBs starting in the third quarter of 
2023, and
• lower legal expense, 
partially offset by
• a $1.0 billion contribution of Visa shares to the 
JPMorgan Chase Foundation recorded in the second 
quarter of 2024, and
• higher costs associated with the Firm's international 
consumer initiatives. 
The provision for credit losses was $10 million.
The provision in the prior year was $171 million, 
reflecting a net addition to the allowance for credit 
losses related to a single name exposure, which was 
subsequently charged off upon the restructuring of a 
loan.
Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for additional information 
on the investment securities portfolio and the 
allowance for credit losses.
The current period income tax expense was driven by 
changes in the level and mix of income and expenses 
subject to U.S. federal and state and local taxes, 
including the impact of the net gain on Visa shares and 
the contribution of Visa shares to the JPMorgan Chase 
Foundation recorded in the second quarter of 2024, 
partially offset by benefits related to tax audit 
settlements.
Other Corporate includes the Firm's international 
consumer initiatives, which primarily consists of Chase 
U.K., Nutmeg, and an ownership stake in C6 Bank.
The deposits within Corporate relate to the Firm’s 
international consumer initiatives and have increased 
as a result of growth in client accounts, reflecting the 
impact of additional product offerings.

Treasury and CIO overview 
Treasury and CIO is predominantly responsible for 
measuring, monitoring, reporting and managing the 
Firm’s liquidity, funding, capital, structural interest rate 
and foreign exchange risks. The risks managed by 
Treasury and CIO arise from the activities undertaken 
by the Firm’s three reportable business segments to 
serve their respective client bases, which generate 
both on- and off-balance sheet assets and liabilities.
Treasury and CIO seeks to achieve the Firm’s assetliability management objectives generally by investing 
in high quality securities that are managed for the 
longer-term as part of the Firm’s investment securities 
portfolio. Treasury and CIO also uses derivatives to 
meet the Firm’s asset-liability management objectives. 
Refer to Note 5 for further information on derivatives. 
In addition, Treasury and CIO manages the Firm’s cash 
position primarily through deposits at central banks 
and investments in short-term instruments. Refer to 
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 108–115 for 
further information on liquidity and funding risk. Refer 
to Market Risk Management on pages 141–149 for 
information on interest rate and foreign exchange 
risks.
The investment securities portfolio predominantly 
consists of U.S. and non-U.S. government securities, 
U.S. GSE and government agency and nonagency 
mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan 
obligations, obligations of U.S. states and 
municipalities and other ABS. At December 31, 2024, 
the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, 
net of the allowance for credit losses, was $678.3 
billion, and the average credit rating of the securities 
comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based upon 
external ratings where available and, where not 
available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings). 
Refer to Note 10 for further information on the Firm’s 
investment securities portfolio and internal risk 
ratings.

FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk is an inherent part of JPMorganChase’s business 
activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or 
wholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their 
investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or 
offers other products or services, the Firm takes on 
some degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is to 
manage its business, and the associated risks, in a 
manner that balances serving the interests of its 
clients, customers and investors, and protecting the 
safety and soundness of the Firm. 
The Firm believes that effective risk management 
requires, among other things: 
• Acceptance of responsibility, including identification 
and escalation of risks by all individuals within the 
Firm; 
• Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data 
and management within each of the LOBs and 
Corporate; and 
• A Firmwide risk governance and oversight structure.
The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced 
compensation framework with strong internal 
governance and independent oversight by the Board 
of Directors (the “Board”). The impact of risk and 
control issues is carefully considered in the Firm’s 
performance evaluation and incentive compensation 
processes. 
Risk governance framework
The Firm’s risk governance framework involves 
understanding drivers of risks, types of risks and 
impacts of risks. 
Drivers of risks are factors that cause a risk to exist. 
Drivers of risks include the economic environment, 
regulatory or government policy, competitor or market 
evolution, business decisions, process or judgment 
error, deliberate wrongdoing, dysfunctional markets 
and natural disasters.
Types of risks are categories by which risks manifest 
themselves. The Firm’s risks are generally categorized 
in the following four risk types: 
Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, 
liquidity or reputation associated with poorlydesigned or failed business plans or an inadequate 
response to changes in the operating environment. 
• Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with 
the default or change in credit profile of a client, 
counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a 
reduction in expected returns on investments, 
including consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk 
and investment portfolio risk. 
• Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of 
changes in market factors, such as interest and 
foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity 
prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the 
value of assets and liabilities held for both the short 
and long term. 
• Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome 
resulting from inadequate or failed internal 
processes or systems; human factors; or external 
events impacting the Firm’s processes or systems. 
Operational risk includes cybersecurity, compliance, 
conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk.
Impacts of risks are consequences of risks, both 
quantitative and qualitative. There may be many 
consequences when risks manifest themselves, 
including quantitative impacts such as a reduction in 
earnings and capital, liquidity outflows, and fines or 
penalties, or qualitative impacts such as damage to the 
Firm’s reputation, loss of clients and customers, and 
regulatory and enforcement actions.
The Firm’s risk governance framework is managed on 
a Firmwide basis. The Firm has an Independent Risk 
Management (“IRM”) function, which is comprised of 
Risk Management and Compliance. The Firm’s Chief 
Executive Officer (“CEO”) appoints, subject to approval 
by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors (the 
“Board Risk Committee”), the Firm’s Chief Risk Officer 
(“CRO”) to lead the IRM function and maintain the risk 
governance framework of the Firm. The framework is 
subject to approval by the Board Risk Committee 
through its review and approval of the Risk 
Governance and Oversight Policy.
The Firm’s CRO oversees and delegates authority to 
the Firmwide Risk Executives (“FREs”), the Chief Risk 
Officers of the LOBs and Corporate (“LOB CROs”), and 
the Firm’s Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”), who, in 
turn, establish Risk Management and Compliance 
organizations, develop the Firm’s risk governance 
policies and standards, and define and oversee the 
implementation of the Firm’s risk governance 
framework. The LOB CROs oversee risks that arise in 
their LOBs and Corporate, while FREs oversee risks 
that span across the LOBs and Corporate, as well as 
functions and regions. Each area of the Firm that gives 
rise to risk is expected to operate within the 
parameters identified by the IRM function, and within 
the risk and control standards established by its own 
management.

Three lines of defense
The Firm’s “three lines of defense” are as follows: 
The first line of defense consists of each LOB, Treasury 
and CIO, and certain Other Corporate initiatives, 
including their aligned Operations, Technology and 
Control Management. The first line of defense owns 
the risks, and identification of risks, associated with 
their respective activities and the design and 
execution of controls to manage those risks. 
Responsibilities also include adherence to applicable 
laws, rules and regulations and implementation of the 
risk governance framework established by IRM, which 
may include policies, standards, limits, thresholds and 
controls. 
The second line of defense is the IRM function, which is 
separate from the first line of defense and is 
responsible for independently measuring risk, as well 
as assessing and challenging the risk management 
activities of the first line of defense. IRM is also 
responsible for the identification of risks within its 
organization, its own adherence to applicable laws, 
rules and regulations and for the development and 
implementation of policies and standards with respect 
to its own processes. 
The third line of defense is Internal Audit, an 
independent function that provides objective 
assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of 
Firmwide processes, controls, governance and risk 
management. The Internal Audit function is led by the 
General Auditor, who reports to the Audit Committee 
and administratively to the CEO.
In addition, there are other functions that contribute to 
the Firmwide control environment but are not 
considered part of a particular line of defense, 
including Corporate Finance, Human Resources and 
Legal. These other functions are responsible for the 
identification of risks within their respective 
organizations, adherence to applicable laws, rules and 
regulations and implementation of the risk governance 
framework established by IRM.
Risk identification and ownership
The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the 
identification of risks within their respective 
organizations, as well as the design and execution of 
controls, including IRM-specified controls, to manage 
those risks. To support this activity, the Firm has a risk 
identification framework designed to facilitate the 
responsibility of each LOB and Corporate to identify 
material risks inherent to the Firm’s businesses and 
operational activities, catalog them in a central 
repository and review material risks on a regular basis. 
The IRM function reviews and challenges the risks 
identified by each LOB and Corporate, maintains the 
central repository and provides the consolidated 
Firmwide results to the Firmwide Risk Committee 
(“FRC”) and the Board Risk Committee. 
Risk appetite
The Firm’s overall appetite for risk is governed by Risk 
Appetite frameworks for quantitative and qualitative 
risks. The Firm’s risk appetite is periodically set and 
approved by senior management (including the CEO 
and CRO) and approved by the Board Risk Committee. 
Quantitative and qualitative risks are assessed to 
monitor and measure the Firm’s capacity to take risk 
consistent with its stated risk appetite. Risk appetite 
results are reported to the Board Risk Committee. 
Management’s discussion and analysis

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

Risk governance and oversight structure
The independent status of the IRM function is supported by a risk governance and oversight structure that provides 
channels for the escalation of risks and issues to senior management, the FRC and the Board of Directors, as 
appropriate. 
The chart below illustrates the principal standing committees of the Board of Directors and key senior 
management-level committees in the Firm’s risk governance and oversight structure. In addition, there are other 
committees, forums and channels of escalation that support the oversight of risk that are not shown in the chart 
below or described in this Form 10-K.
The Firm’s Operating Committee, which consists of the 
Firm’s CEO, CRO, Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), 
General Counsel, CEOs of the LOBs and other senior 
executives, is accountable to and may refer matters to 
the Firm’s Board of Directors. The Operating 
Committee and certain other members of senior 
management are responsible for escalating to the 
Board the information necessary to facilitate the 
Board’s exercise of its duties.
Board oversight
The Firm’s Board of Directors actively oversees the 
business and affairs of the Firm. This includes 
monitoring the Firm’s financial performance and 
condition and reviewing the strategic objectives and 
plans of the Firm. The Board carries out a significant 
portion of its oversight responsibilities through its 
principal standing committees, each of which consists 
solely of independent members of the Board. The 
Board Risk Committee is the principal committee that 
oversees risk matters. The Audit Committee oversees 
the control environment, and the Compensation & 
Management Development Committee oversees 
compensation and other management-related 
matters. Each committee of the Board oversees 
reputation risks, conduct risks, and environmental, 
social and governance (“ESG”) matters within its scope 
of responsibility.
The JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Board of Directors is 
responsible for the oversight of management of the 
bank, which it discharges both acting directly and 
through the principal standing committees of the 
Firm’s Board of Directors. Risk and control oversight 
on behalf of JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. is primarily the 
responsibility of the Board Risk Committee and the 
Audit Committee, respectively, and, with respect to 
compensation and other management-related 
matters, the Compensation & Management 
Development Committee.
The Board Risk Committee assists the Board in its 
oversight of management’s responsibility to 
implement a global risk management framework 
reasonably designed to identify, assess and manage 
the Firm’s risks. The Board Risk Committee’s 
responsibilities include approval of applicable primary 
risk policies and review of certain associated 
frameworks, analysis and reporting established by

The Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight 
of management’s responsibilities to ensure that there 
is an effective system of controls reasonably designed 
to safeguard the Firm’s assets and income, ensure the 
integrity of the Firm’s financial statements, and 
maintain compliance with the Firm’s ethical standards, 
policies, plans and procedures, and with laws and 
regulations. It also assists the Board in its oversight of 
the qualifications, independence and performance of 
the Firm’s independent registered public accounting 
firm, and of the performance of the Firm’s Internal 
Audit function.
The Compensation & Management Development 
Committee (“CMDC”) assists the Board in its oversight 
of the Firm’s compensation principles and practices. 
The CMDC reviews and approves the Firm’s 
compensation and qualified benefits programs. The 
Committee reviews the performance of Operating 
Committee members against their goals, and 
approves their compensation awards. In addition, the 
CEO’s compensation award is subject to ratification by 
the independent directors of the Board. The CMDC 
also reviews the development of and succession for 
key executives. As part of the Board’s role of 
reinforcing, demonstrating and communicating the 
“tone at the top,” the CMDC oversees the Firm’s 
culture, including reviewing updates from 
management regarding significant conduct issues and 
any related actions with respect to employees, 
including compensation actions.
The Public Responsibility Committee oversees and 
reviews the Firm's positions and practices on public 
responsibility matters such as community investment, 
fair lending, sustainability, consumer practices and 
other public policy issues that reflect the Firm's values 
and character and could impact the Firm's reputation 
among its stakeholders. The Committee also provides 
guidance on these matters to management and the 
Board, as appropriate.
The Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee 
exercises general oversight with respect to the 
governance of the Board of Directors. It reviews the 
qualifications of and recommends to the Board 
proposed nominees for election to the Board. The 
Committee evaluates and recommends to the Board 
corporate governance practices applicable to the 
Firm. It also reviews the framework for assessing the 
Board’s performance and self-evaluation. 
Management oversight
The Firm’s senior management-level committees that 
are primarily responsible for key risk-related functions 
include:
The Firmwide Risk Committee (“FRC”) is the Firm’s 
highest management-level risk committee. It oversees 
the risks inherent in the Firm’s business and provides a 
forum for discussion of risk-related and other topics 
and issues that are raised or escalated by its members 
and other committees.
The Firmwide Control Committee (“FCC”) is an 
escalation committee for senior management to 
review and discuss the Firmwide compliance and 
operational risk environment, including identified 
issues, compliance and operational risk metrics and 
significant events that have been escalated. 
Line of Business and Regional Risk Committees are 
responsible for overseeing the governance, limits and 
controls that have been established within the scope 
of their respective activities. These committees review 
the ways in which the particular LOB or the businesses 
operating in a particular region could be exposed to 
adverse outcomes, with a focus on identifying, 
accepting, escalating and/or requiring remediation of 
matters brought to these committees. 
Management’s discussion and analysis

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

Line of Business and Corporate Function Control 
Committees oversee the risk and control environment 
of their respective business or function, inclusive of 
Operational Risk, Compliance and Conduct Risks. As 
part of that mandate, they are responsible for 
reviewing indicators of elevated or emerging risks and 
other data that may impact the level of compliance and 
operational risk in a business or function, addressing 
key compliance and operational risk issues, with an 
emphasis on processes with control concerns, and 
overseeing control remediation. 
The Asset and Liability Committee (“ALCO”) is 
responsible for overseeing the Firm’s asset and liability 
management (“ALM”), including the activities and 
frameworks supporting management of the balance 
sheet, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and capital risk. 
The Firmwide Valuation Governance Forum (“VGF”) is 
composed of senior finance and risk executives and is 
responsible for overseeing the management of risks 
arising from valuation activities conducted across the 
Firm.
Risk governance and oversight functions
The Firm monitors and measures its risk through risk 
governance and oversight functions. The scope of a 
particular function or business activity may include 
one or more drivers, types and/or impacts of risk. For 
example, Country Risk Management oversees country 
risk which may be a driver of risk or an aggregation of 
exposures that could give rise to multiple risk types 
such as credit or market risk. 
The following sections discuss the risk governance 
and oversight functions that have been established to 
oversee the risks inherent in the Firm’s business 
activities.

STRATEGIC RISK MANAGEMENT
Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or 
reputation associated with poorly-designed or failed 
business plans or an inadequate response to changes 
in the operating environment. 
Management and oversight
The Operating Committee, together with the senior 
leadership of each LOB and Corporate, are responsible 
for managing the Firm’s most significant strategic 
risks. IRM engages regularly in strategic business 
discussions and decision-making, including 
participation in relevant business reviews and senior 
management meetings, risk and control committees 
and other relevant governance forums, and review of 
acquisitions and new business initiatives. The Board of 
Directors oversees management’s strategic decisions, 
and the Board Risk Committee oversees IRM and the 
Firm’s risk governance framework.
In the process of developing business plans and 
strategic initiatives, LOB and Corporate senior 
management identify the associated risks that are 
incorporated into the Firmwide Risk Identification 
framework and their impact on risk appetite. 
In addition, IRM conducts a qualitative assessment of 
the LOB and Corporate strategic initiatives to assess 
their impact on the risk profile of the Firm. 
The Firm’s strategic planning process, which includes 
the development of the Firm’s strategic plan and other 
strategic initiatives, is one component of managing the 
Firm’s strategic risk. The strategic plan outlines the 
Firm’s strategic framework and initiatives, and 
includes components such as budget, risk appetite, 
capital, earnings and asset-liability management 
objectives. Guided by the Firm’s Business Principles, 
the Operating Committee and senior management 
teams in each LOB and Corporate review and update 
the strategic plan periodically, including evaluating the 
strategic framework and performance of strategic 
initiatives, assessing the operating environment, 
refining existing strategies and developing new 
strategies.
The Firm’s strategic plan, together with IRM’s 
assessment, are provided to the Board as part of its 
review and approval of the Firm’s strategic plan, and 
the plan is also reflected in the Firm's budget. 
The Firm’s balance sheet strategy, which focuses on 
risk-adjusted returns, strong capital and robust 
liquidity, is also a component in the management of 
strategic risk. Refer to Capital Risk Management on 
pages 97–107 for further information on capital risk. 
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 108–115 
for further information on liquidity risk. Refer to 
Reputation Risk Management on page 116 for further 
information on reputation risk.
Management’s discussion and analysis

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
Capital risk is the risk that the Firm has an insufficient 
level or composition of capital to support the Firm’s 
business activities and associated risks during normal 
economic environments and under stressed 
conditions.
A strong capital position is essential to the Firm’s 
business strategy and competitive position. 
Maintaining a strong balance sheet to manage through 
economic volatility is a strategic imperative of the 
Firm’s Board of Directors, CEO and Operating 
Committee. The Firm’s “fortress balance sheet” 
philosophy focuses on risk-adjusted returns, strong 
capital and robust liquidity. The Firm’s capital risk 
management strategy focuses on maintaining longterm stability to enable the Firm to build and invest in 
market-leading businesses, including in highly 
stressed environments. Senior management considers 
the implications on the Firm’s capital prior to making 
significant decisions that could impact future business 
activities. In addition to considering the Firm’s 
earnings outlook, senior management evaluates all 
sources and uses of capital with a view to ensuring the 
Firm’s capital strength.
Capital risk management
The Firm has a Capital Risk Management function 
whose primary objective is to provide independent 
oversight of capital risk across the Firm.
Capital Risk Management’s responsibilities include:
• Defining, monitoring and reporting capital risk 
metrics;
• Establishing, calibrating and monitoring capital risk 
limits and indicators, including capital risk appetite;
• Developing processes to classify, monitor and report 
capital limit breaches; 
• Performing assessments of the Firm’s capital 
management activities, including changes made to 
the Contingency Capital Plan described below; and
• Conducting assessments of the Firm's regulatory 
capital framework intended to ensure compliance 
with applicable regulatory capital rules.
Capital management
Treasury and CIO is responsible for capital 
management.
The primary objectives of the Firm’s capital 
management are to:
• Maintain sufficient capital in order to continue to 
build and invest in the Firm’s businesses through 
normal economic cycles and in stressed 
environments;
• Retain flexibility to take advantage of future 
investment opportunities;
• Promote the Parent Company’s ability to serve as a 
source of strength to its subsidiaries;
• Ensure the Firm operates above the minimum 
regulatory capital ratios as well as maintain “wellcapitalized” status for the Firm and its principal 
insured depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiary, 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at all times under 
applicable regulatory capital requirements;
• Meet capital distribution objectives; and
• Maintain sufficient capital resources to operate 
throughout a resolution period in accordance with 
the Firm’s preferred resolution strategy.
The Firm addresses these objectives through: 
• Establishing internal minimum capital requirements 
and maintaining a strong capital governance 
framework. The internal minimum capital levels 
consider the Firm’s regulatory capital requirements 
as well as an internal assessment of capital 
adequacy, in normal economic cycles and in stress 
events;
• Retaining flexibility in order to react to a range of 
potential events; and
• Regularly monitoring the Firm’s capital position and 
following prescribed escalation protocols, both at 
the Firm and material legal entity levels.
Governance
Committees responsible for overseeing the Firm’s 
capital management include the Capital Governance 
Committee, the Firmwide ALCO as well as regional 
ALCOs, and the CIO, Treasury and Corporate (“CTC”) 
Risk Committee. In addition, the Board Risk Committee 
periodically reviews the Firm’s capital risk tolerance. 
Refer to Firmwide Risk Management on pages 91–95 
for additional discussion of the Firmwide ALCO and 
other risk-related committees.
Capital planning and stress testing
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review 
The Federal Reserve requires the Firm, as a large Bank 
Holding Company (“BHC”), to submit at least annually 
a capital plan that has been reviewed and approved by 
the Board of Directors. The Federal Reserve uses 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) 
and other stress testing processes to assess whether 
large BHCs, such as the Firm, have sufficient capital 
during periods of economic and financial stress, and 
have robust, forward-looking capital assessment and 
planning processes in place that address each BHC’s 
unique risks to enable it to absorb losses under certain 
stress scenarios. Through CCAR, the Federal Reserve 
evaluates each BHC’s capital adequacy and internal 
capital adequacy assessment processes (“ICAAP”), as 
well as its plans to make capital distributions, such as 
dividend payments or stock repurchases. The Federal 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

Reserve uses results under the severely adverse 
scenario from its supervisory stress test to determine 
each firm’s Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”) requirement 
for the coming year. 
The Firm's current SCB requirement is 3.3% and will 
remain in effect until September 30, 2025. The Firm’s 
Standardized CET1 capital ratio requirement, including 
regulatory buffers, was 12.3% as of December 31, 2024.
Refer to Capital actions on page 105 for information on 
actions taken by the Firm’s Board of Directors. 
Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process 
Annually, the Firm prepares the ICAAP, which informs 
the Board of Directors of the ongoing assessment of 
the Firm’s processes for managing the sources and 
uses of capital as well as compliance with supervisory 
expectations for capital planning and capital 
adequacy. The Firm’s ICAAP integrates stress testing 
protocols with capital planning. The Firm’s Audit 
Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving 
the capital planning framework.
Stress testing assesses the potential impact of 
alternative economic and business scenarios on the 
Firm’s earnings and capital. Economic scenarios, and 
the parameters underlying those scenarios, are 
defined centrally and applied uniformly across the 
businesses. These scenarios are articulated in terms of 
macroeconomic factors, which are key drivers of 
business results; global market shocks, which 
generate short-term but severe trading losses; and 
idiosyncratic operational risk events. The scenarios 
are intended to capture and stress key vulnerabilities 
and idiosyncratic risks facing the Firm. In addition to 
CCAR and other periodic stress testing, management 
also considers tailored stress scenarios and sensitivity 
analyses, as necessary. 
Contingency Capital Plan
The Firm’s Contingency Capital Plan establishes the 
capital management framework for the Firm and 
specifies the principles underlying the Firm’s approach 
towards capital management in normal economic 
conditions and in stressed environments. The 
Contingency Capital Plan defines how the Firm 
calibrates its targeted capital levels and meets 
minimum capital requirements, monitors the ongoing 
appropriateness of planned capital distributions, and 
sets out the capital contingency actions that are 
expected to be taken or considered at various levels of 
capital depletion during a period of stress.
Regulatory capital
The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, 
including well-capitalized standards, for the Firm as a 
consolidated financial holding company. The Office of 
the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") establishes 
similar minimum capital requirements and standards 
for the Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. The U.S. capital requirements generally 
follow the Capital Accord of the Basel Committee, as 
amended from time to time.
Basel III Overview 
The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum 
capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards 
for large and internationally active U.S. BHCs and 
banks, including the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
N.A. The minimum amount of regulatory capital that 
must be held by BHCs and banks is determined by 
calculating RWA, which are on-balance sheet assets 
and off-balance sheet exposures, weighted according 
to risk. Under the rules currently in effect, two 
comprehensive approaches are prescribed for 
calculating RWA: a standardized approach (“Basel III 
Standardized”), and an advanced approach (“Basel III 
Advanced”). 
For each of these risk-based capital ratios, the capital 
adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the lower of 
the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared 
to their respective regulatory capital ratio 
requirements.
The current Basel III rules establish capital 
requirements for calculating credit risk RWA and 
market risk RWA, and in the case of Basel III Advanced, 
operational risk RWA. Key differences in the 
calculation of credit risk RWA between the 
Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for 
Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risksensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of 
internal credit models and parameters, whereas for 
Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally 
based on supervisory risk-weightings which vary 
primarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market 
risk RWA is generally calculated consistently between 
Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced. In 
addition to the RWA calculated under these 
approaches, the Firm may supplement such amounts 
to incorporate management judgment and feedback 
from its regulators.
As of December 31, 2024, the Firm’s Basel III 
Standardized ratios risk-based ratios were more 
binding than the Basel III Advanced risk-based ratios. 
Additionally, Basel III requires that Advanced 
Approaches banking organizations, including the Firm, 
calculate their SLRs. 
Refer to page 104 for additional information on SLR.

Key Regulatory Developments 
U.S. Basel III Finalization
In July 2023, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the 
FDIC released a proposal to amend the risk-based 
capital framework, entitled "Regulatory capital rule: 
Amendments applicable to large banking 
organizations and to banking organizations with 
significant trading activity", which is referred to in this 
Form 10-K as the "U.S. Basel III proposal". Under this 
proposal, changes to the framework would include 
replacement of the Advanced approach with an 
expanded risk-based approach for the calculation of 
RWA. In addition, the stress capital buffer requirement 
would be applicable to both the expanded risk-based 
approach and the Standardized approach.
GSIB Surcharge and TLAC and Eligible LTD 
Requirements
In July 2023, the Federal Reserve released a proposal 
to amend the calculation of the GSIB surcharge. Under 
the proposal, the annual GSIB surcharge would be 
based on an average of the quarterly surcharge 
calculations throughout the calendar year, with daily 
averaging required for certain measures. The proposal 
would also reduce surcharge increments from 50 bps 
to 10 bps and includes other technical amendments to 
the “Method 2” calculation. The proposed changes 
would revise risk-based capital requirements for the 
Firm and other U.S. GSIBs. Refer to Risk-based Capital 
Regulatory Requirements on page 100 for further 
information on the GSIB surcharge. 
Additionally, in August 2023, the Federal Reserve, the 
FDIC and the OCC released a proposal to expand the 
eligible long-term debt ("eligible LTD") and clean 
holding company requirements under the existing 
total loss-absorbing capacity ("TLAC") rule to apply to 
non-GSIB banks with $100 billion or more in total 
consolidated assets. The proposal would also reduce 
the amount of LTD with remaining maturities of less 
than two years that count towards a U.S. GSIB's TLAC 
requirement and expand the existing capital deduction 
framework for LTD issued by GSIBs to include LTD 
issued by non-GSIB banks subject to the LTD 
requirements. 
Finalization of the above proposals, including the 
required implementation dates, is uncertain. The Firm 
continues to monitor developments and potential 
impacts.

Risk-based Capital Regulatory Requirements 
The following chart presents the Firm’s Basel III CET1 capital ratio requirements under the Basel III rules currently in 
effect.
All banking institutions are currently required to have a 
minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted 
assets.
Certain banking organizations, including the Firm, are 
required to hold additional levels of capital to serve as 
a “capital conservation buffer”. The capital 
conservation buffer incorporates a GSIB surcharge, a 
discretionary countercyclical capital buffer and a fixed 
capital conservation buffer of 2.5% for Advanced 
regulatory capital requirements, as well as a variable 
SCB requirement, floored at 2.5%, for Standardized 
regulatory capital requirements. 
Under the Federal Reserve’s GSIB rule, the Firm is 
required to assess its GSIB surcharge on an annual 
basis under two separately prescribed methods based 
on data for the previous fiscal year-end, and is subject 
to the higher of the two. “Method 1” reflects the GSIB 
surcharge as prescribed by the Basel Committee’s 
assessment methodology, and is calculated across 
five criteria: size, cross-jurisdictional activity, 
interconnectedness, complexity and substitutability. 
“Method 2” modifies the Method 1 requirements to 
include a measure of short-term wholesale funding in 
place of substitutability, and introduces a GSIB score 
“multiplication factor”. 
The following table presents the Firm’s effective GSIB 
surcharge for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 
2023. For 2025, the Firm’s effective regulatory 
minimum GSIB surcharge calculated under both 
Method 1 and Method 2 remains unchanged at 2.5% 
and 4.5%, respectively.

Method 1
 2.5 %
 2.5 %
Method 2
 4.5 %
 4.0 %
The U.S. federal regulatory capital standards include a 
framework for setting a discretionary countercyclical 
capital buffer taking into account the macro financial 
environment in which large, internationally active 
banks function. As of December 31, 2024, the U.S. 
countercyclical capital buffer remained at 0%. The 
Federal Reserve will continue to review the buffer at 
least annually. The buffer can be increased if the 
Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC determine that 
systemic risks are meaningfully above normal and can 
be calibrated up to an additional 2.5% of RWA subject 
to a 12-month implementation period. 
Failure to maintain regulatory capital equal to or in 
excess of the risk-based regulatory capital minimum 
plus the capital conservation buffer (inclusive of the 
GSIB surcharge) and any countercyclical buffer will 
result in limitations to the amount of capital that the 
Firm may distribute, such as through dividends and 
common share repurchases, as well as on 
discretionary bonus payments for certain executive 
officers.

GSIB top-tier holding companies, including the Firm, to 
maintain minimum levels of external TLAC and eligible 
LTD. Refer to TLAC on page 106 for additional 
information.
Leverage-based Capital Regulatory Requirements
Supplementary leverage ratio
Banking organizations subject to the Basel III 
Advanced approach are currently required to have a 
minimum SLR of 3.0%. Certain banking organizations, 
including the Firm, are also required to hold an 
additional 2.0% leverage buffer. The SLR is defined as 
Tier 1 capital under Basel III divided by the Firm’s total 
leverage exposure. Total leverage exposure is 
calculated by taking the Firm’s total average onbalance sheet assets, less amounts permitted to be 
deducted for Tier 1 capital, and adding certain offbalance sheet exposures, as defined in regulatory 
capital rules. Refer to SLR on page 104 for additional 
information.
Failure to maintain an SLR equal to or greater than the 
regulatory requirement will result in limitations on the 
amount of capital that the Firm may distribute such as 
through dividends and common share repurchases, as 
well as on discretionary bonus payments for certain 
executive officers.
Other regulatory capital
In addition to meeting the capital ratio requirements of 
Basel III, the Firm and its principal IDI subsidiary, 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., must also maintain 
minimum capital and leverage ratios in order to be 
“well-capitalized” under the regulations issued by the 
Federal Reserve and the Prompt Corrective Action 
requirements of the FDIC Improvement Act, 
respectively. Refer to Note 27 for additional 
information. 
Additional information regarding the Firm’s capital 
ratios, as well as the U.S. federal regulatory capital 
standards to which the Firm is subject, is presented in 
Note 27. Refer to the Firm’s Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital 
Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s 
website, for further information on the Firm’s current 
capital measures.

Line of business and Corporate equity 
Each LOB and Corporate is allocated capital by taking 
into consideration a variety of factors including capital 
levels of similarly rated peers and applicable 
regulatory capital requirements. ROE is measured and 
internal targets for expected returns are established 
as key measures of an LOB’s performance. 
The Firm’s current equity allocation methodology 
incorporates Basel III Standardized RWA and the GSIB 
surcharge, both under rules currently in effect, as well 
as a simulation of capital depletion in a severe stress 
environment. At least annually, the assumptions, 
judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital 
are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to 
the LOBs and Corporate may change. As of January 1, 
2025, changes to the Firm’s capital allocations are 
primarily a result of updates to the Firm’s current 
capital requirements and changes in RWA for each 
LOB under rules currently in effect. Any capital that the 
Firm has accumulated in excess of these current 
requirements, including the capital required to meet 
the potential increased requirements of the U.S. Basel 
III proposal, has been retained in Corporate in addition 
to its allocated balance. 
The following table presents the capital allocated to 
each LOB and Corporate.

On June 28, 2024, the Firm announced that its Board 
of Directors had authorized a new $30 billion common 
share repurchase program, effective July 1, 2024. 
Through June 30, 2024, the Firm was authorized to 
purchase up to $30 billion of common shares under its 
previously-approved common share repurchase 
program that was announced on April 13, 2022.

(b) In the second half of 2022, the Firm temporarily suspended 
share repurchases, which it resumed in the first quarter of 2023 
under its common share repurchase program.
The Board of Directors’ authorization to repurchase 
common shares is utilized at management’s 
discretion. The $30 billion common share repurchase 
program approved by the Board of Directors does not 
establish specific price targets or timetables. 
Management determines the amount and timing of 
common share repurchases based on various factors, 
including market conditions; legal and regulatory 
considerations affecting the amount and timing of 
repurchase activity; the Firm’s capital position (taking 
into account goodwill and intangibles); organic capital 
generation; current and proposed future capital 
requirements; and other investment opportunities. The 
amount of common shares that the Firm repurchases 
in any period may be substantially more or less than 
the amounts estimated or actually repurchased in 
prior periods, reflecting the dynamic nature of the 
decision-making process. The Firm’s common share 
repurchases may be suspended by management at 
any time; and may be executed through open market 
purchases or privately negotiated transactions, or 
utilizing Rule 10b5-1 plans, which are written trading 
plans that the Firm may enter into from time to time 
under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 and which allow the Firm to repurchase its 
common shares during periods when it may otherwise 
not be repurchasing common shares — for example, 
during internal trading blackout periods.

Other capital requirements 
Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity
The Federal Reserve’s TLAC rule requires the U.S. 
GSIB top-tier holding companies, including the Firm, to 
maintain minimum levels of external TLAC and eligible 
long-term debt.
The external TLAC requirements and the minimum 
level of eligible long-term debt requirements are 
shown below:
(a) RWA is the greater of Standardized and Advanced compared to 
their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements.
Failure to maintain TLAC equal to or in excess of the 
regulatory minimum plus applicable buffers will result 
in limitations on the amount of capital that the Firm 
may distribute, such as through dividends and 
common share repurchases, as well as on 
discretionary bonus payments for certain executive 
officers.
The following table presents the eligible external TLAC 
and eligible LTD amounts, as well as a representation

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to 
meet its cash and collateral needs as they arise or that 
it does not have the appropriate amount, composition 
and tenor of funding and liquidity to support its assets 
and liabilities. 
Liquidity risk management
The Firm has a Liquidity Risk Management (“LRM”) 
function whose primary objective is to provide 
independent oversight of liquidity risk across the Firm. 
Liquidity Risk Management’s responsibilities include: 
• Defining, monitoring and reporting liquidity risk 
metrics; 
• Independently establishing and monitoring limits 
and indicators, including liquidity risk appetite; 
• Developing a process to classify, monitor and report 
limit breaches; 
• Performing an independent review of liquidity risk 
management processes to evaluate their adequacy 
and effectiveness; 
• Monitoring and reporting internal Firmwide and legal 
entity liquidity stress tests, regulatory defined 
metrics, as well as liquidity positions, balance sheet 
variances and funding activities; and 
• Approving or escalating for review new or updated 
liquidity stress assumptions.
Liquidity management 
Treasury and CIO is responsible for liquidity 
management.
The primary objectives of the Firm’s liquidity 
management are to: 
• Ensure that the Firm’s core businesses and material 
legal entities are able to operate in support of client 
needs and meet contractual and contingent financial 
obligations through normal economic cycles as well 
as during stress events, and 
• Manage an optimal funding mix and availability of 
liquidity sources. 
The Firm addresses these objectives through: 
• Analyzing and understanding the liquidity 
characteristics of the assets and liabilities of the 
Firm, LOBs, legal entities, as well as currencies, 
taking into account legal, regulatory, and operational 
restrictions; 
• Developing and maintaining internal liquidity stress 
testing assumptions; 
• Defining and monitoring Firmwide and legal entityspecific liquidity strategies, policies, reporting and 
contingency funding plans; 
• Managing liquidity within the Firm’s approved limits 
and indicators, including liquidity risk appetite 
tolerances; 
• Managing compliance with regulatory requirements 
related to funding and liquidity risk; and 
• Setting FTP in accordance with underlying liquidity 
characteristics of balance sheet assets and liabilities 
as well as certain off-balance sheet items. 
As part of the Firm’s overall liquidity management 
strategy, the Firm manages liquidity and funding using 
a centralized, global approach designed to: 
• Optimize liquidity sources and uses; 
• Monitor exposures; 
• Identify constraints on the transfer of liquidity 
between the Firm’s legal entities; and 
• Maintain the appropriate amount of surplus liquidity 
at a Firmwide and legal entity level, where relevant. 
Governance
Committees responsible for liquidity governance 
include the Firmwide ALCO, as well as regional ALCOs, 
the Treasurer Committee, and the CTC Risk 
Committee. In addition, the Board Risk Committee 
reviews and recommends to the Board of Directors, for 
approval, the Firm’s liquidity risk tolerances, liquidity 
strategy, and liquidity policy. Refer to Firmwide Risk 
Management on pages 91–95 for further discussion of 
ALCO and other risk-related committees. 
Internal stress testing
The Firm conducts internal liquidity stress testing to 
monitor liquidity positions at the Firm and its material 
legal entities under a variety of adverse scenarios, 
including scenarios analyzed as part of the Firm’s 
resolution and recovery planning. Internal stress tests 
are produced on a daily basis, and other stress tests 
are performed in response to specific market events or 
concerns. Liquidity stress tests assume all of the 
Firm’s contractual financial obligations are met and 
take into consideration: 
• Varying levels of access to unsecured and secured 
funding markets; 
• Estimated non-contractual and contingent cash 
outflows;
• Credit rating downgrades; 
• Collateral haircuts; and 
• Potential impediments to the availability and 
transferability of liquidity between jurisdictions and 
material legal entities such as regulatory, legal or 
other restrictions. 
Liquidity outflows are modeled across a range of time 
horizons and currency dimensions and contemplate 
both market and idiosyncratic stresses. 
Results of stress tests are considered in the 
formulation of the Firm’s funding plan and assessment 
of its liquidity position. The Parent Company acts as a 
source of funding for the Firm through equity and 
Management’s discussion and analysis

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

long-term debt issuances, and its intermediate holding 
company, JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC (the “IHC”), 
provides funding to support the ongoing operations of 
the Parent Company and its subsidiaries. The Firm 
manages liquidity at the Parent Company, the IHC, and 
operating subsidiaries at levels sufficient to comply 
with liquidity risk tolerances and minimum liquidity 
requirements, and to manage through periods of 
stress when access to normal funding sources may be 
disrupted.
Contingency funding plan
The Firm’s Contingency Funding Plan (“CFP”) sets out 
the strategies for addressing and managing liquidity 
resource needs during a liquidity stress event and 
incorporates liquidity risk limits, indicators and risk 
appetite tolerances. The CFP also identifies the 
alternative contingent funding and liquidity resources 
available to the Firm and its legal entities in a period of 
stress. 
LCR and HQLA
The LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA 
that is sufficient to meet their respective estimated 
total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendarday period of significant stress. Eligible HQLA, for 
purposes of calculating the LCR, is the amount of 
unencumbered HQLA that satisfy certain operational 
considerations as defined in the LCR rule. HQLA 
primarily consist of cash and certain high-quality liquid 
securities as defined in the LCR rule.
Under the LCR rule, the amount of eligible HQLA held 
by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its 
stand-alone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that 
is not transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be 
excluded from the Firm’s reported eligible HQLA.
Estimated net cash outflows are based on 
standardized stress outflow and inflow rates 
prescribed in the LCR rule, which are applied to the 
balances of the Firm’s assets, sources of funds, and 
obligations. The LCR for both the Firm and JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a minimum of 100%. 
The following table summarizes the Firm and 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the 
three months ended December 31, 2024, September 
30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 based on the Firm’s

during the three months ended December 31, 2024, 
compared with the three months ended September 
30, 2024, driven by activities in CIB Markets, partially 
offset by lower market values of HQLA-eligible 
investment securities and funding maturities.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the 
three months ended December 31, 2024 decreased 
compared with the three months ended December 31, 
2023, driven by dividend payments to the Parent 
Company and lending activity, largely offset by higher 
market values of HQLA-eligible investment securities, 
a reduction in unencumbered non-HQLA AFS 
securities, activities in CIB Markets, and long-term 
debt issuances.

Three months ended September 30, 2024 
Three months ended December 31, 2023 

Each of the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s 
average LCR may fluctuate from period to period due 
to changes in their respective eligible HQLA and 
estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing 
business activity and from the impacts of Federal 
Reserve actions as well as other factors. Refer to the 
Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports, which are available 
on the Firm’s website, for a further discussion of the 
Firm’s LCR.
Liquidity sources
In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s eligible 
HQLA discussed above, the Firm had unencumbered 
marketable securities, such as equity and debt 
securities, that the Firm believes would be available to 
raise liquidity. This includes excess eligible HQLA 
securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not 
transferable to non-bank affiliates. The fair value of 
these securities was approximately $594 billion and 
$649 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
respectively, although the amount of liquidity that 
could be raised at any particular time would be 
dependent on prevailing market conditions. The 
decrease compared to December 31, 2023, was driven 
by reductions in unencumbered AFS securities in 
Treasury and CIO, excess eligible HQLA securities at 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and unencumbered CIB 
trading assets.
The Firm had approximately $1.4 trillion of available 
cash and securities as of both December 31, 2024 and 
2023. For each respective period, the amount was 
comprised of eligible end-of-period HQLA, excluding 
the impact of regulatory haircuts, of approximately 
$834 billion and $798 billion, and unencumbered 
marketable securities with a fair value of 
approximately $594 billion and $649 billion.
The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the 
Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLBs”) and the discount 
window at the Federal Reserve Banks as a result of 
collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of 
approximately $413 billion and $340 billion as of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This 
borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and 
securities reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or other 
unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at 
the Federal Reserve Banks discount window and other 
central banks. Available borrowing capacity increased 
from December 31, 2023 primarily due to a higher 
amount of commercial loans and credit card 
receivables pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks. 
Although available, the Firm does not view this 
borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Banks 
discount window and the other central banks as a 
primary source of liquidity.
NSFR
The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity 
requirement for large banking organizations that is 
intended to measure the adequacy of “available” 
stable funding that is sufficient to meet their “required” 
amounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon. 
For the three months ended December 31, 2024, both 
the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were 
compliant with the 100% minimum NSFR requirement, 
based on the Firm’s interpretation of the final NSFR 
rule. Refer to the Firm's U.S. NSFR Disclosure report on 
the Firm’s website for additional information.

Funding
Sources of funds
Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and 
secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its onand off-balance sheet obligations, which includes both 
short- and long-term cash requirements.
The Firm funds its global balance sheet through 
diverse sources of funding including deposits, secured 
and unsecured funding in the capital markets and 
stockholders’ equity. Deposits are the primary funding 
source for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may access funding 
through short- or long-term secured borrowings, the 
issuance of unsecured long-term debt, or from 
borrowings from the IHC. The Firm’s non-bank 
subsidiaries are primarily funded from long-term 
unsecured borrowings and short-term secured 
borrowings which are primarily securities loaned or 
sold under repurchase agreements. Excess funding is 
invested by Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment 
securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other shortterm liquid investments based on their interest rate 
and liquidity risk characteristics. 
Refer to Note 28 for additional information on off–
balance sheet obligations.

(a) In the fourth quarter of 2023, CCB transferred certain deposits associated with First Republic to AWM and CIB. 
The Firm believes that deposits provide a stable 
source of funding and reduce the Firm’s reliance on 
the wholesale funding markets. A significant portion of 
the Firm’s deposits are consumer deposits and 
wholesale operating deposits, which are both 
considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale 
operating deposits are generally considered to be 
stable sources of liquidity because they are generated 
from customers that maintain operating service 
relationships with the Firm. 
The Firm believes that average deposit balances are 
generally more representative of deposit trends than 
period-end deposit balances. However, during periods 
of market disruption, average deposit trends may be 
impacted.
The following discussion excludes the impact of the 
transfer of certain First Republic deposits in the fourth 
quarter of 2023 from CCB to the other LOBs as the 
transfers had no net impact on Firmwide deposits.
Average deposits increased for the year ended 
December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended 
December 31, 2023, reflecting:
• an increase in CIB due to net inflows predominantly 
in Payments and net issuances of structured notes 
as a result of client demand in Markets, partially 
offset by deposit attrition, which included actions 
taken to reduce certain deposits,
• the timing impact of First Republic,
• an increase in AWM as a result of growth in balances 
in new and existing client accounts, reflecting the 
impact of higher-yielding product offerings, largely 
offset by continued migration into other 
investments, and
• a decline in CCB primarily driven by a decrease in 
balances in existing accounts due to increased 
customer spending, largely offset by new accounts. 
Period-end deposits increased from December 31, 
2023, reflecting:
• an increase in CIB due to net inflows predominantly 
in Payments, largely offset by net maturities of 
structured notes in Markets,
• an increase in AWM as a result of growth in balances 
in new and existing client accounts, reflecting the 
impact of higher-yielding product offerings, largely 
offset by continued migration into other 
investments, and
• a decline in CCB primarily driven by a decrease in 
balances in existing accounts due to increased 
customer spending and migration into higheryielding investments, predominantly offset by new 
accounts.

Certain deposits are covered by insurance protection 
that provides additional funding stability and results in 
a benefit to the LCR. Deposit insurance protection may 
be available to depositors in the countries in which the 
deposits are placed. For example, the FDIC provides 
deposit insurance protection for deposits placed in a 
U.S. depository institution. At December 31, 2024 and 

(a), the Firmwide estimated uninsured deposits 
were $1,414.0 billion and $1,347.8 billion, respectively, 
primarily reflecting wholesale operating deposits.
Total uninsured deposits include time deposits. The 
table below presents an estimate of uninsured U.S. and 
non-U.S. time deposits, and their remaining maturities. 
The Firm’s estimates of its uninsured U.S. time 
deposits are based on data that the Firm calculates 
periodically under applicable FDIC regulations. For 
purposes of this presentation, all non-U.S. time 
deposits are deemed to be uninsured.

Short-term funding 
The Firm’s primary source of short-term secured 
funding is securities sold under agreements to 
repurchase. These instruments are secured 
predominantly by high-quality securities collateral, 
including government-issued debt and U.S. GSE and 
government agency MBS. Securities sold under 
agreements to repurchase increased at December 31, 
2024, compared with December 31, 2023, driven by 
Markets, reflecting higher client-driven marketmaking activities and higher secured financing of 
trading assets.
The increase in secured other borrowed funds at 
December 31, 2024 from December 31, 2023, as well 
as the increase for the average year ended 
December 31, 2024, compared to the prior year period, 
were both due to higher financing requirements in 
Markets, partially offset by FHLB maturities in 
Treasury and CIO.
The balances associated with securities loaned or sold 
under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time 
due to investment and financing activities of clients, 
the Firm’s demand for financing, the ongoing 
management of the mix of the Firm’s liabilities, 
including its secured and unsecured financing (for 
both the investment securities and market-making 
portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors.
The Firm’s primary sources of short-term unsecured 
funding consist of issuances of wholesale commercial 
paper and other borrowed funds. 
The decrease in average commercial paper for the 
year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior 
year period was due to lower issuances primarily as a 
result of short-term liquidity management.
The increase in unsecured other borrowed funds at 
December 31, 2024 from December 31, 2023, was 
predominantly driven by net issuances of structured 
notes in Markets.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

Average 2023 

Long-term funding
Long-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term 
funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations and regulatory requirements, 
including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and 
optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal 
long-term funding plan. 
Unsecured funding and issuance
The significant majority of the Firm’s total outstanding long-term debt has been issued by the Parent Company to 
provide flexibility in support of the funding needs of both bank and non-bank subsidiaries. The Parent Company 
advances substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external 
counterparties. The increase in structured notes at December 31, 2024 from December 31, 2023, and for the 
average year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the prior year period, was primarily driven by net issuances of 
structured notes in Markets due to client demand.
The following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the years ended 
December 31, 2024 and 2023. Refer to Note 20 for additional information on the IHC and long-term debt.

Credit ratings
The cost and availability of financing are influenced by 
credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have 
an adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity 
sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger additional 
collateral or funding requirements and decrease the 
number of investors and counterparties willing to lend 
to the Firm. The nature and magnitude of the impact of 
ratings downgrades depends on numerous 
contractual and behavioral factors, which the Firm 
believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk and stress 
testing metrics. The Firm believes that it maintains 
sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential decrease in 
funding capacity due to ratings downgrades.
Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs 
and other third-party commitments may be adversely 
affected by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to Notes 5 
and 14 for additional information.
The credit ratings of the Parent Company and certain of its principal subsidiaries as of December 31, 2024 were as 
follows:

JPMorganChase’s unsecured debt does not contain 
requirements that would call for an acceleration of 
payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the 
existing debt, provide any limitations on future 
borrowings or require additional collateral, based on 
unfavorable changes in the Firm’s credit ratings, 
financial ratios, earnings, or stock price.
Critical factors in maintaining high credit ratings 
include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong 
capital and liquidity ratios, strong credit quality and 
risk management controls, and diverse funding 
sources. Rating agencies continue to evaluate 
economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory 
developments, future profitability, risk management 
practices, and litigation matters, as well as their 
broader ratings methodologies. Changes in any of 
these factors could lead to changes in the Firm’s credit 
ratings.

REPUTATION RISK MANAGEMENT
Reputation risk is the risk that an action or inaction 
may negatively impact perception of the Firm’s 
integrity and reduce confidence in the Firm’s 
competence by various stakeholders, including clients, 
counterparties, customers, communities, investors, 
regulators, or employees. 
The types of events that may result in reputation risk 
are wide-ranging and can be introduced by the Firm’s 
employees, business strategies and activities, clients, 
customers and counterparties with which the Firm 
does business. These events could contribute to 
financial losses, litigation, regulatory enforcement 
actions, fines, penalties or other sanctions, as well as 
other harm to the Firm. 
Organization and management 
Reputation Risk Management is an independent risk 
management function that establishes the governance 
framework for managing reputation risk across the 
Firm’s LOBs and Corporate. Reputation risk is 
inherently challenging to identify, manage, and 
quantify.
The Firm’s reputation risk management function 
includes the following activities:
• Maintaining a Firmwide Reputation Risk Governance 
policy and a standard consistent with the reputation 
risk framework 
• Providing oversight of the governance framework 
through processes and infrastructure to support 
consistent identification, escalation and monitoring 
of reputation risk issues Firmwide
Governance and oversight
The Reputation Risk Governance policy establishes 
the principles for managing reputation risk for the 
Firm. It is the responsibility of each LOB and 
Corporate, and the Firm’s employees, to consider the 
reputation of the Firm when deciding whether to offer 
a new product, engage in a transaction or client 
relationship, enter a new jurisdiction, initiate a 
business process or consider any other activity. 
Environmental impacts and social concerns are 
important considerations in assessing the Firm’s 
reputation risk, and are a component of the Firm’s 
reputation risk governance.

CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT
Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with 
the default or change in credit profile of a client, 
counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a 
reduction in expected returns on investments, 
including consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, 
and investment portfolio risk.
Credit risk management
Credit risk is the risk associated with the default or 
change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or 
customer. The Firm provides credit to a variety of 
clients and customers, ranging from large corporate 
and institutional clients to individual consumers and 
small businesses. In its consumer businesses, the Firm 
is exposed to credit risk primarily through its home 
lending, credit card, auto, and business banking 
businesses. In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is 
exposed to credit risk through its underwriting, 
lending, market-making, and hedging activities with 
and for clients and counterparties, as well as through 
its operating services activities (such as cash 
management and clearing activities), and securities 
financing activities. The Firm is also exposed to credit 
risk through its investment securities portfolio and 
cash placed with banks.
Credit Risk Management monitors and measures 
credit risk throughout the Firm, and defines credit risk 
policies, procedures and limits. The Firm’s credit risk 
management governance includes the following 
activities:
• Maintaining a credit risk policy framework
• Monitoring and measuring credit risk across all 
portfolio segments, including transaction and 
exposure approval
• Setting industry and geographic concentration 
limits, as appropriate, and setting guidelines for 
credit review and analysis
• Assigning and maintaining credit approval 
authorities in connection with the approval of credit 
exposure
• Monitoring and independent assessment of 
criticized exposures and delinquent loans, and
• Estimating credit losses and supporting appropriate 
credit risk-based capital management
Risk identification and measurement
To measure credit risk, the Firm employs several 
methodologies for estimating the likelihood of obligor 
or counterparty default. Methodologies for measuring 
credit risk vary depending on several factors, including 
type of asset (e.g., consumer versus wholesale), risk 
measurement parameters (e.g., delinquency status 
and borrower’s credit score versus wholesale riskrating) and risk management and collection processes 
(e.g., retail collection center versus centrally managed 
workout groups). Credit risk measurement is based on 
the probability of default of an obligor or counterparty, 
the loss severity given a default event and the 
exposure at default.
Based on these factors and the methodology and 
estimates described in Note 13 and Note 10, the Firm 
estimates credit losses for its exposures. The 
allowance for loan losses reflects estimated credit 
losses related to the consumer and wholesale held-forinvestment loan portfolios, the allowance for lendingrelated commitments reflects estimated credit losses 
related to the Firm’s lending-related commitments and 
the allowance for investment securities reflects 
estimated credit losses related to the investment 
securities portfolio. Refer to Note 13, Note 10 and 
Critical Accounting Estimates used by the Firm on 
pages 161–164 for further information.
In addition, potential and unexpected credit losses are 
reflected in the allocation of credit risk capital and 
represent the potential volatility of actual losses 
relative to the established allowances for loan losses 
and lending-related commitments. The analyses for 
these losses include stress testing that considers 
alternative economic scenarios as described below.
Stress testing
Stress testing is important in measuring and managing 
credit risk in the Firm’s credit portfolio. The stress 
testing process assesses the potential impact of 
alternative economic and business scenarios on 
estimated credit losses for the Firm. Economic 
scenarios and the underlying parameters are defined 
centrally, articulated in terms of macroeconomic 
factors and applied across the businesses. The stress 
test results may indicate credit migration, changes in 
delinquency trends and potential losses in the credit 
portfolio. In addition to the periodic stress testing 
processes, management also considers additional 
stresses outside these scenarios, including industry 
and country- specific stress scenarios, as appropriate. 
The Firm uses stress testing to inform decisions on 
setting risk appetite both at a Firm and LOB level, as 
well as to assess the impact of stress on individual 
counterparties.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

Risk monitoring and management
The Firm has developed policies and practices that are 
designed to preserve the independence and integrity 
of the approval and decision-making process for 
extending credit so that credit risks are assessed 
accurately, approved properly, monitored regularly 
and managed actively at both the transaction and 
portfolio levels. The policy framework establishes 
credit approval authorities, concentration limits, riskrating methodologies, portfolio review parameters and 
guidelines for management of distressed exposures. In 
addition, certain models, assumptions and inputs used 
in evaluating and monitoring credit risk are 
independently validated by groups that are separate 
from the LOBs.
Consumer credit risk is monitored for delinquency and 
other trends, including any concentrations at the 
portfolio level, as certain of these trends can be 
addressed through changes in underwriting policies 
and portfolio guidelines. Consumer Risk Management 
evaluates delinquency and other trends against 
business expectations, current and forecasted 
economic conditions, and industry benchmarks. 
Historical and forecasted economic performance and 
trends are incorporated into the modeling of estimated 
consumer credit losses and are part of the monitoring 
of the credit risk profile of the portfolio. 
Wholesale credit risk is monitored regularly at an 
aggregate portfolio, industry, and individual client and 
counterparty level with established concentration 
limits that are reviewed and revised periodically as 
deemed appropriate by management. Industry and 
counterparty limits, as measured in terms of exposure 
and economic risk appetite, are subject to stressbased loss constraints.
Management of the Firm’s wholesale credit risk 
exposure is accomplished through a number of means, 
including:
• Loan underwriting and credit approval processes
• Loan syndications and participations
• Loan sales and securitizations
• Credit derivatives
• Master netting agreements, and
• Collateral and other risk-reduction techniques
In addition to Credit Risk Management, an 
independent Credit Review function is responsible for: 
• Independently assessing risk grades assigned to 
exposures in the Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio 
and the timeliness of risk grade changes initiated by 
responsible business units; and 
• Evaluating the effectiveness of the credit 
management processes of the LOBs and Corporate, 
including the adequacy of credit analyses and risk 
grading/loss given default (“LGD”) rationales, proper 
monitoring and management of credit exposures, 
and compliance with applicable grading policies and 
underwriting guidelines. 
Refer to Note 12 for further discussion of consumer 
and wholesale loans.
Risk reporting
To enable monitoring of credit risk and effective 
decision-making, aggregate credit exposure, credit 
quality forecasts, concentration levels and risk profile 
changes are reported regularly to senior members of 
Credit Risk Management. Detailed portfolio reporting 
of industry, clients, counterparties and customers, 
product and geography are prepared, and the 
appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is 
reviewed by senior management at least on a quarterly 
basis. Through the risk reporting and governance 
structure, credit risk trends and limit exceptions are 
provided regularly to, and discussed with, risk 
committees, senior management and the Board of 
Directors.

Portfolio analysis
Loans decreased from December 31, 2023 driven by 
residential real estate loans and scored auto loans.
The following discussions provide information 
concerning individual loan products. Refer to Note 12 
for further information about this portfolio, including 
information about delinquencies, loan modifications 
and other credit quality indicators.
Residential real estate: The residential real estate 
portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair 
value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage 
loans and home equity lines of credit. 
Retained loans decreased compared to December 31, 
2023, predominantly driven by paydowns and loan 
sales, net of originations. Retained nonaccrual loans 
decreased compared to December 31, 2023, 
predominantly driven by loan sales. Net recoveries 
were higher for the year ended December 31, 2024 
compared to the prior year, driven by loan sales. 
Loans held-for-sale and nonaccrual loans held-for-sale 
increased from December 31, 2023, predominantly 
driven by transfers of certain retained loans in 
anticipation of securitization and loan sales, 
respectively. 
Loans at fair value increased from December 31, 2023, 
predominantly driven by higher Home Lending loans, 
as originations outpaced warehouse loan sales. 
Nonaccrual loans at fair value increased compared to 
December 31, 2023, driven by CIB.
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying values of 
retained interest-only residential mortgage loans were 
$88.9 billion and $90.6 billion, respectively. These 
loans have an interest-only payment period generally 
followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully 
amortizing payment period to maturity and are 
typically originated as higher-balance loans to higherincome borrowers. The credit performance of this 
portfolio is comparable to the performance of the 
broader prime mortgage portfolio.
The carrying value of retained home equity lines of 
credit outstanding was $14.5 billion at December 31, 
2024, including $3.8 billion of HELOCs that have 
recast from interest-only to fully amortizing payments 
or have been modified, and $3.6 billion of interest-only 
balloon HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. 
The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their 
revolving period by reducing or canceling the undrawn 
line in accordance with the contract or to the extent 
otherwise permitted by law, including when there has 
been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness 
of the borrower or significant decrease in the value of 
the underlying property.
The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s
residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or 
guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, 
predominantly loans held-for-sale and loans at fair 
value. The Firm monitors its exposure to certain 
potential unrecoverable claim payments related to 
government-insured loans and considers this 
exposure in estimating the allowance for loan losses.

Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio, 
including loans at fair value, generally consists of 
prime-quality scored auto and business banking loans, 
other consumer unsecured loans, and overdrafts. The 
portfolio decreased when compared to December 31, 
2023, predominantly due to loan securitizations. Net 
charge-offs increased compared to the prior year, 
predominantly due to net charge-offs of scored auto 
loans of $445 million compared to $357 million for the 
year ended December 31, 2023, reflecting a decline in 
used vehicle valuations. Refer to Note 14 for further 
information on securitization activity.

Credit card
Total credit card loans increased from December 31, 
2023 reflecting growth from new accounts and 
revolving balances. The December 31, 2024 30+ and 
90+ day delinquency rates of 2.17% and 1.14%, 
respectively, increased compared to the December 31, 
2023 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 2.14% and 
1.05%, respectively, in line with the Firm’s 
expectations. Net charge-offs increased for the year 
ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year 
reflecting the seasoning of vintages originated in 
recent years, credit normalization and balance growth.
Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card loans 
typically remain on accrual status until charged off. 
However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses includes 
the estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and 
billed interest and fee income. 
Geographic and FICO composition of credit card 
loans
At December 31, 2024, $109.0 billion, or 47% of the 
total retained credit card loan portfolio, was 
concentrated in California, Texas, New York, Florida 
and Illinois, compared to $98.1 billion, or 46%, at 
December 31, 2023. 
Refer to Note 12 for further information about this 
portfolio, including information about delinquencies, 
geographic and FICO composition.

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO 
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to 
credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, 
market-making, and hedging activities with and for 
clients and counterparties, as well as through various 
operating services (such as cash management and 
clearing activities), securities financing activities and 
cash placed with banks. A portion of the loans 
originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale 
businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. 
The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the 
loans that it originates into the market as part of its 
syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio 
concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio 
is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, indepth reviews of client credit quality and transaction 
structure, inclusive of collateral where applicable, and 
of industry, product and client concentrations. Refer to 
the industry discussion on pages 128–131 for further 
information.
The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes 
exposure held in CIB, AWM and Corporate, and riskrated exposure held in CCB, for which the wholesale 
methodology is applied when determining the 
allowance for loan losses.
As of December 31, 2024, loans increased $19.8 billion, 
driven by higher loans in CIB and higher securitiesbased lending in AWM. Lending-related commitments 
decreased $5.3 billion, with decreases in AWM and 
CCB, largely offset by higher commitments in CIB.
As of December 31, 2024, nonperforming exposure 
increased by $2.3 billion, predominantly driven by Real 
Estate, concentrated in Office, Healthcare and 
Consumer & Retail, in each case resulting from 
downgrades.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, wholesale net 
charge-offs were $822 million, largely driven by Real 
Estate, concentrated in Office, and client-specific 
charge-offs across multiple industries including 
Consumer & Retail and Individuals.

Wholesale credit exposure – maturity and ratings profile
The following tables present the maturity and internal risk ratings profiles of the wholesale credit portfolio as of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative characteristics 
equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and takes into consideration collateral and structural 
support when determining the internal risk rating for each credit facility. Refer to Note 12 for further information on

(a) Loans held-for-sale are primarily related to syndicated loans and loans transferred from the retained portfolio.
(b) These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP.
(c) The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference entity and the ratings profile shown is based on the ratings of the 
reference entity on which protection has been purchased. Predominantly all of the credit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has 
purchased protection used in credit portfolio management activities are executed with investment-grade counterparties. In addition, the Firm 
obtains credit protection against certain loans in the retained loan portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes. 
(d) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is generally based on remaining contractual 
maturity. Derivative contracts that are in a receivable position at December 31, 2024, may become payable prior to maturity based on their 
cash flow profile or changes in market conditions.

Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to 
industries with actual or potential credit concerns. 
Exposures that are deemed to be criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, 
which consist of the special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized exposure, excluding 
loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $44.7 billion and $41.4 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
representing approximately 3.5% and 3.3% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively; of the $44.7 billion, 
$39.9 billion was performing. The increase in criticized exposure was driven by Real Estate resulting from 
downgrades, primarily in Multifamily and Office, and new commitments in Technology and Media, partially offset by 
Consumer & Retail resulting from net portfolio activity and upgrades.
The table below summarizes by industry the Firm’s exposures as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The industry of 
risk category is generally based on the client or counterparty’s primary business activity. Refer to Note 4 for 
additional information on industry concentrations.

Lending-related commitments
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, 
such as commitments (including revolving credit 
facilities) and guarantees, to address the financing 
needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these 
financial instruments represent the maximum possible 
credit risk should the clients draw down on these 
commitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations 
under these guarantees, and the clients subsequently 
fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts. 
Most of these commitments and guarantees have 
historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or 
expired without being drawn upon or a default 
occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the 
total contractual amount of these wholesale lendingrelated commitments is representative of the Firm’s 
expected future credit exposure or funding 
requirements. Refer to Note 28 for further information 
on wholesale lending-related commitments.
Receivables from customers
Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment 
margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM 
that are collateralized by assets maintained in the 
clients’ brokerage accounts (including cash on deposit, 
and primarily liquid and readily marketable debt or 
equity securities). To manage its credit risk, the Firm 
establishes margin requirements and monitors the 
required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires 
clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or 
to reduce positions, when appropriate. Credit risk arising 
from lending activities subject to collateral maintenance 
requirements is generally mitigated by factors such as 
the short-term nature of the activity, the fair value of 
collateral held and the Firm’s right to call for, and the 
borrower’s obligation to provide, additional margin when 
the fair value of the collateral declines. Because of these 
mitigating factors, these receivables generally do not 
require an allowance for credit losses. However, if in 
management’s judgment, an allowance for credit losses 
is required, the Firm estimates expected credit losses 
based on the value of the collateral and probability of 
borrower default. These receivables are reported within 
accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm’s 
Consolidated balance sheets.
Refer to Note 13 for further information on the Firm’s 
accounting policies for the allowance for credit losses.
Derivative contracts
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage 
risk, including credit risk and risks arising from 
fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange and 
equities and commodities prices. The Firm makes 
markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and 
uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with 
net open risk positions from its market-making 
activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising 
from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses 
derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and 
other market risk exposure. The nature of the 
counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the 
derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is 
exposed. For over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives, the 
Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative 
counterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”), 
such as futures and options, and cleared over-thecounter (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also 
be exposed to the credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where 
possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk 
exposures arising from derivative contracts through the 
use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements 
and collateral agreements. The percentage of the Firm’s 
OTC derivative transactions subject to collateral 
agreements — excluding foreign exchange spot trades, 
which are not typically covered by collateral agreements 
due to their short maturity and centrally cleared trades 
that are settled daily — was approximately 86% and 87% 
at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Refer to 
Note 5 for additional information on the Firm’s use of 
collateral agreements and for a further discussion of 
derivative contracts, counterparties and settlement 
types.
The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the 
Consolidated balance sheets was $61.0 billion and $54.9 
billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 
increase was primarily as a result of market movements. 
Derivative receivables represent the fair value of the 
derivative contracts after giving effect to legally 
enforceable master netting agreements and the related 
cash collateral held by the Firm.
In addition, the Firm holds liquid securities and other 
cash collateral that may be used as security when the 
fair value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor. 
For these purposes, the definition of liquid securities is 
consistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets 
as defined in the LCR rule.
In management’s view, the appropriate measure of 
current credit risk should also take into consideration 
other collateral, which generally represents securities 
that do not qualify as high quality liquid assets under the 
LCR rule. The benefits of these additional collateral 
amounts for each counterparty are subject to a legally 
enforceable master netting agreement and limited to the 
net amount of the derivative receivables for each 
counterparty.
The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, 
G7 government securities, other liquid government 
agency and guaranteed securities, and corporate debt 
and equity securities) delivered by clients at the 
initiation of transactions, as well as collateral related to 
contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and 
collateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not 
yet settled as of the reporting date. Although this 
collateral does not reduce the receivables balances and 
is not included in the tables below, it is available as 
security against potential exposure that could arise 
should the fair value of the client’s derivative contracts 
move in the Firm’s favor. Refer to Note 5 for additional 
information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements 
for derivative transactions.

While useful as a current view of credit exposure, the 
net fair value of the derivative receivables does not 
capture the potential future variability of that credit 
exposure. To capture this variability, the Firm 
calculates, on a client-by-client basis, three measures 
of potential derivatives-related credit loss: Peak, 
Derivative Risk Equivalent (“DRE”), and Average 
exposure (“AVG”). These measures all incorporate 
netting and collateral benefits, where applicable.
Peak represents a conservative measure of potential 
derivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, 
to a counterparty calculated in a manner that is 
broadly equivalent to a 97.5% confidence level over the 
life of the transaction. Peak is the primary measure 
used by the Firm for setting credit limits for derivative 
contracts, senior management reporting and 
derivatives exposure management.
DRE exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of 
derivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, 
on a basis intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan 
exposures. DRE is a less extreme measure of potential 
credit loss than Peak.
Finally, AVG is a measure of the expected fair value of 
the Firm’s derivative exposures, including the benefit 
of collateral, at future time periods. AVG over the total 
life of the derivative contract is used as the primary 
metric for pricing purposes and is used to calculate 
credit risk capital and CVA, as further described below. 
The fair value of the Firm’s derivative receivables 
incorporates CVA to reflect the credit quality of 
counterparties. CVA is based on the Firm’s AVG to a 
counterparty and the counterparty’s credit spread in 
the credit derivatives market. The Firm believes that 
active risk management is essential to controlling the 
dynamic credit risk in the derivatives portfolio. In 
addition, the Firm’s risk management process for 
derivatives exposures takes into consideration the 
potential impact of wrong-way risk, which is broadly 
defined as the risk that exposure to a counterparty is 
positively correlated with the impact of a default by the 
same counterparty, which could cause exposure to 
increase at the same time as the counterparty’s 
capacity to meet its obligations is decreasing. Many 
factors may influence the nature and magnitude of 
these correlations over time. To the extent that these 
correlations are identified, the Firm may adjust the 
CVA associated with a particular counterparty’s AVG. 
The Firm risk manages exposure to changes in CVA by 
entering into credit derivative contracts, as well as 
interest rate, foreign exchange, equity and commodity 
derivative contracts.
The below graph shows exposure profiles to the Firm’s 
current derivatives portfolio over the next 10 years as 
calculated by the Peak, DRE and AVG metrics. The 
three measures generally show that exposure will 
decline after the first year, if no new trades are added 
to the portfolio.

Credit derivatives
The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary 
purposes: first, in its capacity as a market-maker, and 
second, as an end-user to manage the Firm’s own 
credit risk associated with various exposures.
Credit portfolio management activities
Included in the Firm’s end-user activities are credit 
derivatives used to mitigate the credit risk associated 
with traditional lending activities (loans and lendingrelated commitments) and derivatives counterparty 
exposure in the Firm’s wholesale businesses 
(collectively, “credit portfolio management activities”). 
Information on credit portfolio management activities 
is provided in the table below. 
The Firm also uses credit derivatives as an end-user to 
manage other exposures, including credit risk arising 
from certain securities held in the Firm’s marketmaking businesses. These credit derivatives are not 
included in credit portfolio management activities.

(a) Amounts are presented net, considering the Firm’s net

reference entity or index. 
The credit derivatives used in credit portfolio 
management activities do not qualify for hedge 
accounting under U.S. GAAP; these derivatives are 
reported at fair value, with gains and losses recognized 
in principal transactions revenue. In contrast, the loans 
and lending-related commitments being riskmanaged are accounted for on an accrual basis. This 
asymmetry in accounting treatment, between loans 
and lending-related commitments and the credit 
derivatives used in credit portfolio management 
activities, causes earnings volatility that is not 
representative, in the Firm’s view, of the true changes 
in value of the Firm’s overall credit exposure.
The effectiveness of credit default swaps (“CDS”) as a 
hedge against the Firm’s exposures may vary 
depending on a number of factors, including the 
named reference entity (i.e., the Firm may experience 
losses on specific exposures that are different than the 
named reference entities in the purchased CDS); the 
contractual terms of the CDS (which may have a 
defined credit event that does not align with an actual 
loss realized by the Firm); and the maturity of the 
Firm’s CDS protection (which in some cases may be 
shorter than the Firm’s exposures). However, the Firm 
generally seeks to purchase credit protection with a 
maturity date that is the same or similar to the maturity 
date of the exposure for which the protection was 
purchased, and remaining differences in maturity are 
actively monitored and managed by the Firm. Refer to 
Credit derivatives in Note 5 for further information on 
credit derivatives and derivatives used in credit 
portfolio management activities.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents 
management's estimate of expected credit losses over 
the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial 
assets measured at amortized cost and certain offbalance sheet lending-related commitments. The 
Firm's allowance for credit losses generally consists of:
• the allowance for loan losses, which covers the 
Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and riskrated) and is presented separately on the 
Consolidated balance sheets,
• the allowance for lending-related commitments, 
which is reflected in accounts payable and other 
liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, and 
• the allowance for credit losses on investment 
securities, which is reflected in investment securities 
on the Consolidated balance sheets.
Discussion of changes in the allowance
The allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 
2024 was $26.9 billion, reflecting a net addition of $2.1 
billion from December 31, 2023.
The net addition to the allowance for credit losses 
included:
• $2.1 billion in consumer, reflecting:
– a $2.2 billion net addition in Card Services, 
predominantly driven by loan growth, reflecting 
higher revolving balances, including the seasoning 
of vintages originated in recent years, 
partially offset by
– a $125 million net reduction in Home Lending in 
the first quarter of 2024, and 
• a net reduction of $30 million in wholesale, 
reflecting:
– changes in certain macroeconomic variables, an 
update to loss assumptions on certain loans in 
Markets, and a reduction due to charge-offs 
largely from collateral-dependent loans, 
predominantly offset by 
– net downgrade activity, primarily in Real Estate, 
and the impact of incorporating the First Republic 
portfolio into the Firm’s modeled credit loss 
estimates in the second quarter of 2024.
The Firm’s qualitative adjustments continued to 
include additional weight placed on the adverse 
scenarios to reflect ongoing uncertainties and 
downside risks related to the geopolitical and 
macroeconomic environment.
The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated 
using a weighted average of five internally developed 
macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios 
incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors 
than the central case assumptions provided in the 
table below, resulting in:
• a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking 
at 5.5% in the fourth quarter of 2025, and
• a weighted average U.S. real GDP level that is 1.9% 
lower than the central case at the end of the second 
quarter of 2026.
The following table presents the Firm’s central case 
assumptions for the periods presented:

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT 
Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the 
loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on 
investments arising from the investment securities 
portfolio or from principal investments. The 
investment securities portfolio is predominantly held 
by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm's 
balance sheet and asset-liability management 
objectives. Principal investments are predominantly 
privately-held financial instruments and are managed 
in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are typically 
intended to be held over extended periods and, 
accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for shortterm realized gains with respect to these investments.
Investment securities risk 
Investment securities risk includes the exposure 
associated with a default in the payment of principal 
and interest. This risk is mitigated given that the 
investment securities portfolio held by Treasury and 
CIO predominantly consists of high-quality securities. 
At December 31, 2024, the Treasury and CIO 
investment securities portfolio, net of the allowance for 
credit losses, was $678.3 billion, and the average 
credit rating of the securities comprising the portfolio 
was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, 
and where not available, based primarily upon internal 
risk ratings). Refer to Corporate results on pages 88–
90 and Note 10 for further information on the 
investment securities portfolio and internal risk 
ratings. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 
108–115 for further information on related liquidity risk. 
Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 141–149 
for further information on the market risk inherent in 
the portfolio.
Governance and oversight
Investment securities risks are governed by the Firm’s 
Risk Appetite framework, and reviewed at the CTC 
Risk Committee with regular updates provided to the 
Board Risk Committee. 
The Firm’s independent control functions are 
responsible for reviewing the appropriateness of the 
carrying value of investment securities in accordance 
with relevant policies. Approved levels for investment 
securities are established for each risk category, 
including capital and credit risks.
Principal investment risk 
Principal investments are typically privately-held 
financial instruments representing ownership interests 
or other forms of junior capital. In general, principal 
investments include tax-oriented investments and 
investments made to enhance or accelerate the Firm’s 
business strategies and exclude those that are 
consolidated on the Firm's balance sheets. These 
investments are made by dedicated investing 
businesses or as part of a broader business strategy. 
The Firm’s principal investments are managed by the 
LOBs and Corporate and are reflected within their 
respective financial results. The Firm’s investments will 
continue to evolve based on market circumstances 
and in line with its strategic initiatives.

Governance and oversight
The Firm’s approach to managing principal investment 
risk is consistent with the Firm’s risk governance 
structure. The Firm has established a Firmwide risk 
policy framework for all principal investing activities 
that includes approval by executives who are 
independent from the investing businesses, as 
appropriate.
The Firm’s independent control functions are 
responsible for reviewing the appropriateness of the 
carrying value of investments in accordance with 
relevant policies. As part of the risk governance 
structure, approved levels for investments are 
established and monitored for each relevant business 
or segment in order to manage the overall size of the 
portfolios. The Firm also conducts stress testing on 
these portfolios using specific scenarios that estimate 
losses based on significant market moves and/or 
other risk events.
Management’s discussion and analysis

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT
Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of 
changes in market factors such as interest and foreign 
exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit 
spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets 
and liabilities held for both the short and long term. 
Market Risk Management
Market Risk Management monitors market risks 
throughout the Firm and defines market risk policies 
and procedures. 
Market Risk Management seeks to facilitate efficient 
risk/return decisions, reduce volatility in operating 
performance and provide transparency into the Firm’s 
market risk profile for senior management, the Board 
of Directors and regulators. Market Risk Management 
is responsible for the following functions:
• Maintaining a market risk policy framework
• Independently measuring and monitoring LOB, 
Corporate, and Firmwide market risk
• Defining, approving and monitoring limits
• Performing stress testing and qualitative risk 
assessments
Risk measurement
Measures used to capture market risk 
There is no single measure to capture market risk and 
therefore Market Risk Management uses various 
metrics, both statistical and nonstatistical, to assess 
risk including:
• Value-at-risk 
• Stress testing
• Profit and loss drawdowns 
• Earnings-at-risk
• Economic Value Sensitivity
• Other sensitivity-based measures
Risk monitoring and control 
Market risk exposure is managed primarily through a 
series of limits set in the context of the market 
environment and business strategy. In setting limits, 
Market Risk Management takes into consideration 
factors such as market volatility, product liquidity, 
accommodation of client business, and management 
judgment. Market Risk Management maintains 
different levels of limits. Firm level limits include VaR 
and stress limits. Similarly, LOB and Corporate limits 
include VaR and stress limits and may be 
supplemented by certain nonstatistical risk measures 
such as profit and loss drawdowns. Limits may also be 
set within the LOBs and Corporate, as well as at the 
legal entity level.
Market Risk Management sets limits and regularly 
reviews and updates them as appropriate. Senior 
management is responsible for reviewing and 
approving certain of these risk limits on an ongoing 
basis. Limits that have not been reviewed within 
specified time periods by Market Risk Management 
are reported to senior management. The LOBs and 
Corporate are responsible for adhering to established 
limits against which exposures are monitored and 
reported.
Limit breaches are required to be reported in a timely 
manner to limit approvers, which include Market Risk 
Management and senior management. In the event of 
a breach, Market Risk Management consults with 
senior members of appropriate groups within the Firm 
to determine the suitable course of action required to 
return the applicable positions to compliance, which 
may include a reduction in risk in order to remedy the 
breach or granting a temporary increase in limits to 
accommodate an expected increase in client activity 
and/or market volatility. Firm, Corporate or LOB-level 
limit breaches are escalated as appropriate.
Models used to measure market risk are inherently 
imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure 
certain risks or to predict losses. This imprecision may 
be heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market 
conditions occur. For additional discussion on model 
uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk 
Management on page 160.
Market Risk Management periodically reviews the 
Firm’s existing market risk measures to identify 
opportunities for enhancement, and to the extent 
appropriate, will calibrate those measures accordingly 
over time. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

The following table summarizes the predominant business activities and related market risks, as well as positions 
which give rise to market risk and certain measures used to capture those risks, for each LOB and Corporate. 
In addition to the predominant business activities, each LOB and Corporate may engage in principal investing 
activities. To the extent principal investments are deemed market risk sensitive, they are reflected in relevant risk 
measures and captured in the table below. Refer to Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 140 for additional 
discussion on principal investments.

Management’s discussion and analysis

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

Value-at-risk
JPMorganChase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a 
statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential loss 
from adverse market moves in the current market 
environment. The Firm has a single VaR framework 
used as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR 
and Regulatory VaR.
The framework is employed across the Firm using 
historical simulation based on data for the previous 12 
months. The framework’s approach assumes that 
historical changes in market values are representative 
of the distribution of potential outcomes in the 
immediate future. The Firm believes the use of Risk 
Management VaR provides a daily measure of risk that 
is closely aligned to risk management decisions made 
by the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other 
market risk measures, provides the appropriate 
information needed to respond to risk events. 
The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated 
assuming a one-day holding period and an expected 
tail-loss methodology which approximates a 95% 
confidence level. Risk Management VaR provides a 
consistent framework to measure risk profiles and 
levels of diversification across product types and is 
used for aggregating risks and monitoring limits 
across businesses. VaR results are reported as 
appropriate to various groups including senior 
management, the Board Risk Committee and 
regulators. 
Underlying the overall VaR model framework are 
individual VaR models that simulate historical market 
returns for individual risk factors and/or product types. 
To capture material market risks as part of the Firm’s 
risk management framework, comprehensive VaR 
model calculations are performed daily for businesses 
whose activities give rise to market risk. These VaR 
models are granular and incorporate numerous risk 
factors and inputs to simulate daily changes in market 
values over the historical period; inputs are selected 
based on the risk profile of each portfolio, as 
sensitivities and historical time series used to generate 
daily market values may be different across product 
types or risk management systems. The VaR model 
results across all portfolios are aggregated at the Firm 
level.
As VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect 
measure of market risk exposure and potential future 
losses. In addition, based on their reliance on available 
historical data, limited time horizons, and other factors, 
VaR measures are inherently limited in their ability to 
measure certain risks and to predict losses, 
particularly those associated with market illiquidity 
and sudden or severe shifts in market conditions. 
For certain products, specific risk parameters are not 
captured in VaR due to the lack of liquidity and 
availability of appropriate historical data. The Firm 
uses proxies to estimate the VaR for these and other 
products when daily time series are not available. It is 
likely that using an actual price-based time series for 
these products, if available, would affect the VaR 
results presented. The Firm therefore considers other 
nonstatistical measures such as stress testing, in 
addition to VaR, to capture and manage its market risk 
positions. 
As VaR model calculations require daily data and a 
consistent source for valuation, the daily market data 
used may be different than the independent thirdparty data collected for VCG price testing in its 
monthly valuation process. For example, in cases 
where market prices are not observable, or where 
proxies are used in VaR historical time series, the data 
sources may differ. Refer to Valuation process in Note 
2 for further information on the Firm’s valuation 
process. 
The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically 
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the 
composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in 
market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s 
modeling techniques and measurements, and other 
factors. Such changes may affect historical 
comparisons of VaR results. Refer to Estimations and 
Model Risk Management on page 160 for information 
regarding model reviews and approvals.
The Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR 
in accordance with regulatory rules (“Regulatory 
VaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s regulatory 
VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III capital 
rules. This Regulatory VaR model framework currently 
assumes a ten business-day holding period and an 
expected tail-loss methodology which approximates a 
99% confidence level. Regulatory VaR is applied to 
“covered” positions as defined by Basel III capital rules, 
which may be different than the positions included in 
the Firm’s Risk Management VaR. For example, credit 
derivative hedges of accrual loans are included in the 
Firm’s Risk Management VaR, while Regulatory VaR 
excludes these credit derivative hedges. In addition, in 
contrast to the Firm’s Risk Management VaR, 
Regulatory VaR currently excludes the diversification 
benefit for certain VaR models.
Refer to JPMorganChase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory 
Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the 
Firm’s website, for additional information on 
Regulatory VaR and the other components of market 
risk regulatory capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based 
measure, stressed VaR-based measure and the 
respective backtesting).

(a) The impact of the business segment reorganization in the second quarter of 2024 was not material to Total CIB VaR. Prior periods have not 
been revised. Refer to Business Segment & Corporate Results on pages 70–90 for additional information.
(b) Diversification benefit represents the difference between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its individual components. This reflects the nonadditive nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and risk types. For maximum and minimum VaR, diversification 
benefit is not meaningful as the maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the 
components.
(c) Includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and credit protection purchased against certain retained loans and lending-related 
commitments, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not 
reported at fair value. In line with the Firm's internal model governance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties 
was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening of the credit spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels. The related 
hedges were also removed to maintain consistency. This exposure is now reflected in other sensitivity-based measures.
(d) In the second quarter of 2024, the presentation of Corporate and other LOB VaR was updated to disaggregate AWM VaR due to the increase 
associated with credit protection purchased against certain retained loans and lending-related commitments. The VaR does not include the 
retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value.
(e) Includes a legacy private equity position which is publicly traded, as well as Visa C shares which the Firm disposed of in the second and third 
quarters of 2024. The impact of Visa C shares resulted in elevated average and maximum Corporate VaR, Other VaR and Total VaR. Refer to 
Executive Overview on pages 54–58 for additional information.
2024 compared with 2023
Average Total VaR increased by $4 million for the year 
ended December 31, 2024 when compared with the 
prior year. The increase was predominantly driven by 
the impact of the Firm’s receipt of Visa C shares on 
Corporate VaR and increases associated with credit 
protection purchased against certain retained loans 
and lending-related commitments within Credit 
Portfolio VaR and AWM VaR, largely offset by market 
volatility rolling out of the one-year historical lookback period impacting the Fixed income risk type.
The following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR for the four trailing quarters. The increase in VaR and 
subsequent decline observed in the second quarter of 2024 was primarily driven by changes in Visa C share 
exposure in the Firm's Corporate VaR.

VaR backtesting
The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which 
compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with 
the daily gains and losses that are utilized for VaR 
backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted 
in the chart below do not reflect the Firm’s reported 
revenue as they exclude certain components of total 
net revenue, such as those associated with the 
execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday clientdriven trading and intraday risk management 
activities), fees, commissions, other valuation 
adjustments and net interest income. These excluded 
components of total net revenue may more than offset 
the backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The 
definition of backtesting gains and losses above is 
consistent with the requirements for backtesting 
under Basel III capital rules.
A backtesting exception occurs when the daily 
backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management 
VaR for the prior day. Under the Firm’s Risk 
Management VaR methodology, assuming current 
changes in market values are consistent with the 
historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm 
would expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions five 
times every 100 trading days on average. The number 
of VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ 
from the statistically expected number of backtesting 
exceptions if the current level of market volatility is 
materially different from the level of market volatility 
during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR 
calculation.
For the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, the Firm 
posted backtesting gains on 179 of the 260 days, and 
observed eight VaR backtesting exceptions, of which 
three were in the three months ended December 31, 
2024. Firmwide backtesting loss days can differ from 
the loss days for which Fixed Income Markets and 
Equity Markets posted losses, as disclosed in CIB 
Markets revenue, as the population of positions which 
comprise each metric are different and due to the 
exclusion of certain components of total net revenue in 
backtesting gains and losses as described above. 
The following chart presents the distribution of 
Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the 
trailing 12 months and three months ended 
December 31, 2024. The daily backtesting losses are 
displayed as a percentage of the corresponding daily 
Risk Management VaR. The count of days with 
backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty 
percentage point intervals. Backtesting exceptions are 
displayed within the intervals that are greater than one 
hundred percent. The results in the chart below differ 
from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market 
Risk section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory 
Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on 
Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm’s covered 
positions.

Other risk measures 
Stress testing 
Along with VaR, stress testing is an important tool 
used to assess risk. While VaR reflects the risk of loss 
due to adverse changes in markets using recent 
historical market behavior, stress testing reflects the 
risk of loss from hypothetical changes in the value of 
market risk sensitive positions applied simultaneously. 
Stress testing measures the Firm’s vulnerability to 
losses under a range of stressed but possible 
economic and market scenarios. The results are used 
to understand the exposures responsible for those 
potential losses and are measured against limits. 
The Firm’s stress framework covers market risk 
sensitive positions in the LOBs and Corporate. The 
framework is used to calculate multiple magnitudes of 
potential stress for both market rallies and market selloffs, assuming significant changes in market factors 
such as credit spreads, equity prices, interest rates, 
currency rates and commodity prices, and combines 
them in multiple ways to capture an array of 
hypothetical economic and market scenarios. 
The Firm generates a number of scenarios that focus 
on tail events in specific asset classes and 
geographies, including how the event may impact 
multiple market factors simultaneously. Scenarios also 
incorporate specific idiosyncratic risks and stress 
basis risk between different products. The flexibility in 
the stress framework allows the Firm to construct new 
scenarios that can test the outcomes against possible 
future stress events. Stress testing results are 
reported periodically to senior management of the 
Firm, as appropriate. 
Stress methodologies are governed by the overall 
stress framework, under the oversight of Market Risk 
Management. The Firmwide Market Risk Stress 
Methodology Committee reviews and approves 
changes to stress testing methodology and scenarios 
across the Firm. Significant changes to the framework 
are escalated to senior management, as appropriate. 
In addition, stress methodology and the models to 
calculate the stress results are subject to the Firm’s 
Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy 
The Firm’s stress testing framework is utilized in 
calculating the Firm’s CCAR and other stress test 
results, which are reported periodically to the Board of 
Directors. In addition, stress testing results are 
incorporated into the Firm’s Risk Appetite framework, 
and are reported periodically to the Board Risk 
Committee. 
Profit and loss drawdowns 
Profit and loss drawdowns are used to highlight 
trading losses above certain levels of risk tolerance. A 
profit and loss drawdown is a decline in revenue from 
its year-to-date peak level.
Structural interest rate risk management 
The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s 
reported net income is important as interest rate risk 
represents one of the Firm’s significant market risks. 
Interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities 
which are included in VaR, but also from the Firm’s 
traditional banking activities, which include extension 
of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits, issuing 
debt, as well as the investment securities portfolio, and 
associated derivative instruments. Refer to the table 
on page 142 for a summary by LOB and Corporate 
identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk.
Governance
The CTC Risk Committee establishes the Firm’s 
interest rate risk management policy and related 
limits, which are subject to approval by the Board Risk 
Committee. Treasury and CIO, working in partnership 
with the LOBs, calculates the Firm’s structural interest 
rate risk profile and reviews it with senior 
management, including the CTC Risk Committee. In 
addition, oversight of structural interest rate risk is 
managed through a dedicated risk function reporting 
to the CTC CRO. This risk function is responsible for 
providing independent oversight and governance 
around assumptions and establishing and monitoring 
limits for structural interest rate risk, including limits 
related to Earnings-at-Risk and Economic Value 
Sensitivity. The Firm manages structural interest rate 
risk generally through its investment securities 
portfolio and interest rate derivatives.
Key risk drivers and risk management process
Structural interest rate risk can arise due to a variety of 
factors, including:
• Differences in timing among the maturity or 
repricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet 
instruments
• Differences in the amounts of assets, liabilities and 
off-balance sheet instruments that are maturing or 
repricing at the same time
• Differences in the amounts by which short-term and 
long-term market interest rates change (for 
example, changes in the slope of the yield curve)
• The impact of changes in the maturity of various 
assets, liabilities or off-balance sheet instruments as 
interest rates change
The Firm manages interest rate exposure related to its 
assets and liabilities on a consolidated, Firmwide 
basis. Business units transfer their interest rate risk to 
Treasury and CIO through funds transfer pricing, 
which takes into account the elements of interest rate 
exposure that can be risk-managed in financial 
markets. These elements include asset and liability 
balances and contractual rates of interest, contractual 
principal payment schedules, expected prepayment 
Management’s discussion and analysis

experience, interest rate reset dates and maturities, 
rate indices used for repricing, and any interest rate 
ceilings or floors for adjustable rate products.
Earnings-at-Risk
One way that the Firm evaluates its structural interest 
rate risk is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk 
estimates the Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given 
interest rate scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to 
a baseline, which includes net interest income and 
certain interest rate sensitive fees. The baseline uses 
market interest rates and, in the case of deposits, 
pricing assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of 
changes to this baseline for interest rate-sensitive 
assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and 
other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). These 
simulations primarily include retained and held-forsale loans, deposits, deposits with banks and financing 
activities, investment securities, long-term debt, 
related interest rate hedges, and funds transfer pricing 
of other positions in risk management VaR and other 
sensitivity-based measures as described on page 142. 
Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024, these 
simulations also include hedges of non-U.S. dollar 
foreign exchange exposures arising from capital 
investments. Refer to non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange 
risk on page 149 for more information.
Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential 
change to a baseline over the following 12 months 
utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios 
include a parallel shift involving changes to both shortterm and long-term rates by an equal amount; a 
steeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates 
constant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter 
yield curve involving increasing short-term rates and 
holding long-term rates constant or holding shortterm rates constant and decreasing long-term rates. 
These scenarios consider many different factors, 
including: 
• The impact on exposures as a result of 
instantaneous changes in interest rates from 
baseline rates.
• Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled 
prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but 
excluding assumptions about actions that could be 
taken by the Firm or its clients and customers in 
response to instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage 
prepayment assumptions are based on the interest 
rates used in the scenarios compared with 
underlying contractual rates, the time since 
origination, and other factors which are updated 
periodically based on historical experience. Deposit 
forecasts are a key assumption in the Firm’s 
earnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects certain 
assumptions relating to the Federal Reserve’s 
balance sheet policy (e.g., quantitative tightening 
and usage at the Reverse Repurchase Facility) that 
require management judgment. The amount of 
deposits that the Firm holds at any given time may 
be influenced by Federal Reserve actions, as well as 
broader monetary conditions and competition for 
deposits.
• The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit 
betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates 
paid could change upon a given change in market 
interest rates. Actual deposit rates paid may differ 
from the modeled assumptions, primarily due to 
customer behavior and competition for deposits.
The Firm performs sensitivity analyses of the 
assumptions used in earnings-at-risk scenarios, 
including with respect to deposit betas and forecasts 
of deposit balances, both of which are especially 
significant in the case of consumer deposits. The 
results of these sensitivity analyses are reported to the 
CTC Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee.
The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically 
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the 
composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in 
market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s 
simulation and other factors. In the second quarter of 
2024, the Firm updated certain deposit rates paid 
assumptions which take into account observed pricing 
and client and customer behavior during the most 
recent economic cycle. These updated deposit rates 
paid assumptions impacted the U.S. dollar scenarios, 
resulting in an increase in positive sensitivity in higher 
interest rate scenarios, and an increase in negative 
sensitivity in lower interest rate scenarios. 
The Firm’s earnings-at-risk sensitivities are measures 
of the Firm’s interest rate exposure. The Firm’s actual 
net interest income for the rate changes presented 
may differ as the earnings-at-risk scenarios are 
modelled as instantaneous changes and exclude any 
actions that could be taken by the Firm or its clients or 
customers in response to rate changes. Other 
significant assumptions in the earnings-at-risk 
scenarios, including mortgage prepayments and 
deposit rates paid, may also differ from actual results. 
The Firm’s forecast for net interest income is included 
in the Firm’s outlook on page 57.

(a) Reflects the simultaneous shift of U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar 
rates, and the inclusion of the hedges of non-U.S. dollar capital 
investments. This inclusion had no impact on total sensitivities 
but increased U.S. dollar and decreased non-U.S. dollar 
sensitivities. Subsequent to this change, non-U.S. dollar 
sensitivities were insignificant.
(b) At December 31, 2023, represents the total of the Firm’s U.S. 
dollar and non-U.S. dollar sensitivities as previously reported.
The change in the Firm’s sensitivities as of December 
31, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023, were 
primarily driven by Treasury and CIO balance sheet 
actions where the Firm added duration through 
investment securities activity, cash flow hedges of 
retained loans and fair value hedges of Firm debt. The 
impact on the sensitivities of the Treasury and CIO 
balance sheet actions were largely offset by the impact 
of deposits, primarily from the second quarter of 2024 
update of the deposit rates paid assumptions for 
certain consumer and wholesale deposit products. 
Additionally, the results as of December 31, 2024 
reflected the update to include hedges of the Firm’s 
non-U.S. dollar capital investments. Although total 
results were not impacted, these hedges increase U.S. 
dollar sensitivities and decrease non-U.S. dollar 
sensitivities. In the absence of these updates the

Economic Value Sensitivity
In addition to earnings-at-risk, which is measured as a 
sensitivity to a baseline of earnings over the next 12 
months, the Firm also measures Economic Value 
Sensitivity (“EVS”). EVS stress tests the longer-term 
economic value of equity by measuring the sensitivity 
of the Firm’s current balance sheet, primarily retained 
loans, deposits, debt and investment securities as well 
as related hedges, under various interest rate 
scenarios. The Firm's pricing and cash flow 
assumptions associated with deposits, as well as 
prepayment assumptions for loans and securities, are 
significant factors in the EVS measure. In accordance 
with the CTC interest rate risk management policy, the 
Firm has established limits on EVS as a percentage of 
TCE.
Certain assumptions used in the EVS measure may 
differ from those required in the fair value 
measurement note to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements. For example, certain assets and liabilities 
with no stated maturity, such as credit card 
receivables and deposits, have longer assumed 
durations in the EVS measure. Additional information 
on long-term debt and held to maturity investment 
securities is disclosed on page 201 in Note 2.

Non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk 
Non-U.S. dollar FX risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates affect the value of the Firm’s assets or 
liabilities or future results. The Firm has structural non-U.S. dollar FX exposures arising from capital investments, 
forecasted expense and revenue, the investment securities portfolio and non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt 
issuance. Treasury and CIO, working in partnership with the LOBs, primarily manage these risks on behalf of the 
Firm. Treasury and CIO may hedge certain of these risks using derivatives. Refer to Business Segment & Corporate 
Results on page 71 for additional information.
Other sensitivity-based measures
The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by 
assessing the potential impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to 
changes in relevant market variables. Refer to the predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on 
page 142 for additional information on the positions captured in other sensitivity-based measures.
The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk sensitive

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT 
The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be 
exposed to country risk resulting from financial, 
economic, political or other significant developments 
which adversely affect the value of the Firm’s 
exposures related to a particular country or set of 
countries. The Country Risk Management group 
actively monitors the various portfolios which may be 
impacted by these developments and measures the 
extent to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified 
given the Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to 
a country.
Organization and management
Country Risk Management is an independent risk 
management function that assesses and monitors 
exposure to country risk across the Firm. 
The Firm’s country risk management function includes 
the following activities:
• Maintaining policies, procedures and standards 
consistent with a comprehensive country risk 
framework
• Assigning sovereign ratings, assessing country risks 
and establishing risk tolerance relative to a country
• Measuring and monitoring country risk exposure 
and stress across the Firm
• Managing and approving country limits and 
reporting trends and limit breaches to senior 
management
• Developing surveillance tools, such as signaling 
models and ratings indicators, for early identification 
of potential country risk concerns
• Providing country risk scenario analysis
Sources and measurement
The Firm is exposed to country risk through its lending 
and deposits, investing, and market-making activities, 
whether cross-border or locally funded. Country 
exposure includes activity with both government and 
private-sector entities in a country. 
Under the Firm’s internal country risk management 
approach, attribution of exposure to an individual 
country is based on the country where the largest 
proportion of the assets of the counterparty, issuer, 
obligor or guarantor are located or where the largest 
proportion of its revenue is derived, which may be 
different than the domicile (i.e. legal residence) or 
country of incorporation. 
Individual country exposures reflect an aggregation of 
the Firm’s risk to an immediate default, with zero 
recovery, of the counterparties, issuers, obligors or 
guarantors attributed to that country. Activities which 
result in contingent or indirect exposure to a country 
are not included in the country exposure measure (for 
example, providing clearing services or secondary 
exposure to collateral on securities financing 
receivables).
Assumptions are sometimes required in determining 
the measurement and allocation of country exposure, 
particularly in the case of certain non-linear or index 
products, or where the nature of the counterparty, 
issuer, obligor or guarantor is not suitable for 
attribution to an individual country. The use of 
different measurement approaches or assumptions 
could affect the amount of reported country exposure.
Under the Firm’s internal country risk measurement 
framework:
• Deposits with banks are measured as the cash 
balances placed with central banks, commercial 
banks, and other financial institutions
• Lending exposures are measured at the total 
committed amount (funded and unfunded), net of 
the allowance for credit losses and eligible cash and 
marketable securities collateral received
• Securities financing exposures are measured at their 
receivable balance, net of eligible collateral received
• Debt and equity securities are measured at the fair 
value of all positions, including both long and short 
positions
• Counterparty exposure on derivative receivables is 
measured at the derivative’s fair value, net of the fair 
value of the eligible collateral received
• Credit derivatives exposure is measured at the net 
notional amount of protection purchased or sold for 
the same underlying reference entity, inclusive of the 
fair value of the derivative receivable or payable, 
reflecting the manner in which the Firm manages 
these exposures
The Firm’s internal country risk reporting differs from 
the reporting provided under the FFIEC bank 
regulatory requirements.
Management’s discussion and analysis

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

Stress testing
Stress testing is an important component of the Firm’s 
country risk management framework, which aims to 
estimate and limit losses arising from a country crisis 
by measuring the impact of adverse asset price 
movements to a country based on market shocks 
combined with counterparty specific assumptions. 
Country Risk Management periodically designs and 
runs tailored stress scenarios to test vulnerabilities to 
individual countries or sets of countries in response to 
specific or potential market events, sector 
performance concerns, sovereign actions and 
geopolitical risks. These tailored stress results are 
used to inform potential risk reduction across the 
Firm, as necessary.
Risk reporting
Country exposure and stress are measured and 
reported regularly, and used by Country Risk 
Management to identify trends and monitor high 
usages and breaches against limits. 
For country risk management purposes, the Firm may 
report exposure to jurisdictions that are not fully 
autonomous, including dependent territories and 
Special Administrative Regions (“SAR”) such as Hong 
Kong SAR, separately from the independent sovereign 
states with which they are associated.
The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 
exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of 
December 31, 2024, and their comparative exposures 
as of December 31, 2023. The top 20 country 
exposures represent the Firm’s largest total exposures 
by individual country. Country exposures may 
fluctuate from period to period due to a variety of 
factors, including client activity, market flows and 
liquidity management activities undertaken by the 
Firm. 
The increase in exposure to Germany when compared 
to December 31, 2023, was driven by an increase in 
cash placed with the central bank of Germany, 
predominantly due to client-driven market-making 
activities and higher client deposits.
The increase in exposure to Japan when compared to 
December 31, 2023, was driven by an increase in cash 
placed with the central bank of Japan as a result of 
client-driven market-making activities.
The Firm continues to monitor its exposure to Russia, 
which corresponds to cash placed with the central 
bank, but which excludes deposits placed on behalf of 
clients at the Deposit Insurance Agency of Russia. The 
Firm currently believes that its remaining exposure to 
Russia is not material. Refer to Note 30 on pages 310–
311 for information concerning Russian litigation.

CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT
Climate risk refers to the potential threats posed by 
climate change to the Firm and its clients, customers, 
operations and business strategy. Climate change is 
viewed as a driver of risk that may impact existing 
types of risks managed by the Firm. Climate risk is 
categorized into physical risk and transition risk.
Physical risk involves economic costs and financial 
losses due to a changing climate. Acute physical risk 
drivers include the increased frequency or severity of 
climate and weather events, such as floods, wildfires 
and tropical cyclones. Chronic physical risk drivers 
include more gradual shifts in the climate, such as sea 
level rise, persistent changes in precipitation levels 
and increases in average ambient temperatures.
Transition risk involves the financial and economic 
consequences of society’s shift toward a lower-carbon 
economy. Transition risk drivers include possible 
changes in public policy, adoption of new technologies 
and shifts in consumer preferences. Transition risks 
may also be influenced by changes in the physical 
climate.
Organization and management
The Firm has a Climate Risk Management function that 
is responsible for establishing and maintaining the 
Firmwide framework and strategy for managing 
climate risks that may impact the Firm.
Other responsibilities of Climate Risk Management 
include:
• Setting policies, standards, procedures and 
processes to support identification, escalation, 
monitoring and management of climate risk across 
the Firm
• Developing metrics, scenarios and stress testing 
mechanisms designed to assess the range of 
potential climate-related financial and economic 
impacts to the Firm
• Establishing a Firmwide climate risk data strategy 
and the supporting climate risk technology 
infrastructure
The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the 
identification, assessment and management of climate 
risks present in their business activities and for the 
adherence to applicable climate-related laws, rules 
and regulations.
Governance and oversight
The Firm’s framework and strategy for managing 
climate risk is integrated into the Firm’s risk 
governance structure. This framework allows for the 
escalation of significant climate risk-related issues to 
LOB Risk Committees. The Board Risk Committee also 
receives information on significant climate risks and 
climate-related initiatives, as appropriate.

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome 
resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes 
or systems; human factors; or external events 
impacting the Firm’s processes or systems. 
Operational Risk includes compliance, conduct, legal, 
and estimations and model risk. Operational risk is 
inherent in the Firm’s activities and can manifest itself 
in various ways, including fraudulent acts, business 
disruptions (including those caused by extraordinary 
events beyond the Firm's control), cyber attacks, 
inappropriate employee behavior, failure to comply 
with applicable laws, rules and regulations or failure of 
vendors or other third party providers to perform in 
accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk 
Management attempts to manage operational risk at 
appropriate levels in light of the Firm’s financial 
position, the characteristics of its businesses, and the 
markets and regulatory environments in which it 
operates. 
Operational Risk Management Framework
The Firm’s Compliance, Conduct, and Operational Risk 
(“CCOR”) Management Framework is designed to 
enable the Firm to govern, identify, measure, monitor 
and test, manage and report on the Firm’s operational 
risk. 
Operational Risk Governance
The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the 
management of operational risk. The Control 
Management Organization, which consists of control 
managers within each LOB and Corporate, is 
responsible for the day-to-day execution of the CCOR 
Framework. 
The Firm’s Global Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”) 
and FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk 
Appetite is responsible for defining the CCOR 
Management Framework and establishing the 
minimum standards for its execution. The LOB and 
Corporate aligned CCOR Lead Officers report to the 
Global CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and 
Qualitative Risk Appetite and are independent of the 
respective businesses or functions they oversee. The 
CCOR Management Framework is included in the Risk 
Governance and Oversight Policy that is reviewed and 
approved by the Board Risk Committee periodically.
Operational Risk Identification
The Firm utilizes a structured risk and control selfassessment process that is executed by the LOBs and 
Corporate. As part of this process, the LOBs and 
Corporate evaluate the effectiveness of their 
respective control environment to assess 
circumstances in which controls have failed, and to 
determine where remediation efforts may be required. 
The Firm’s Operational Risk and Compliance 
organization (“Operational Risk and Compliance”) 
provides oversight of and challenge to these 
evaluations and may also perform independent 
assessments of significant operational risk events and 
areas of concentrated or emerging risk.
Operational Risk Measurement
Operational Risk and Compliance performs an 
independent assessment of the operational risks 
inherent within the LOBs and Corporate, which 
includes evaluating the effectiveness of the control 
environments and reporting the results to senior 
management.
In addition, Operational Risk and Compliance assesses 
operational risks through quantitative means, 
including operational risk-based capital and 
estimation of operational risk losses under both 
baseline and stressed conditions. 
The primary component of the operational risk-based 
capital estimate is the Loss Distribution Approach 
(“LDA”) statistical model, which simulates the 
projected frequency and severity of operational risk 
losses based on historical data. The LDA model is used 
to estimate an aggregate operational risk loss over a 
one-year time horizon, at a 99.9% confidence level. 
The LDA model incorporates actual internal 
operational risk losses in the quarter following the 
period in which those losses were realized, and the 
calculation generally continues to reflect such losses 
even after the issues or business activities giving rise 
to the losses have been remediated or reduced.
As required under the Basel III capital framework, the 
Firm’s operational risk capital methodology, which 
uses the Advanced Measurement Approach (“AMA”), 
incorporates internal and external losses as well as 
management’s view of tail risk captured through 
operational risk scenario analysis, and evaluation of 
key business environment and internal control metrics. 
The Firm does not reflect the impact of insurance in its 
AMA estimate of operational risk capital. 
The Firm considers the impact of stressed economic 
conditions on operational risk losses and develops a 
forward looking view of material operational risk 
events that may occur in a stressed environment. The 
Firm’s operational risk stress testing framework is 
utilized in calculating results for the Firm’s CCAR and 
other stress testing processes. 
Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 97–107 for 
information related to operational risk RWA, and 
CCAR.
Operational Risk Monitoring and Testing
The results of risk assessments performed by 
Operational Risk and Compliance are used in 
connection with their independent monitoring and 
testing compliance of the LOBs and Corporate with 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

laws, rules and regulations. Through monitoring and 
testing, Operational Risk and Compliance 
independently identify areas of heightened operational 
risk and tests the effectiveness of controls within the 
LOBs and Corporate. 
Management of Operational Risk
The operational risk areas or issues identified through 
monitoring and testing are escalated to the LOBs and 
Corporate to be remediated through action plans, as 
needed, to mitigate operational risk. Operational Risk 
and Compliance may advise the LOBs and Corporate 
in the development and implementation of action 
plans.
Operational Risk Reporting
All employees of the Firm are expected to escalate 
risks appropriately. Risks identified by Operational 
Risk and Compliance are escalated to the appropriate 
LOB and Corporate Control Committees, as needed. 
Operational Risk and Compliance has established 
standards designed to ensure that consistent 
operational risk reporting and operational risk reports 
are produced on a Firmwide basis as well as by the 
LOBs and Corporate. Reporting includes the 
evaluation of key risk and performance indicators 
against established thresholds as well as the 
assessment of different types of operational risk 
against stated risk appetite. The standards establish 
escalation protocols to senior management and to the 
Board of Directors.
Insurance
One of the ways in which operational risk may be 
mitigated is through insurance maintained by the Firm. 
The Firm purchases insurance from commercial 
insurers and maintains a wholly-owned captive insurer, 
Park Assurance Company. Insurance may also be 
required by third parties with whom the Firm does 
business.
Subcategories and examples of operational risks
Operational risk can manifest itself in various ways. 
Operational risk subcategories include Compliance 
risk, Conduct risk, Legal risk, and Estimations and 
Model risk. Refer to pages 157, 158, 159 and 160, 
respectively for more information on Compliance, 
Conduct, Legal, and Estimations and Model risk. 
Details on other select examples of operational risks 
such as business and technology resiliency, payment 
fraud and third-party outsourcing, as well as 
cybersecurity, are provided below. 
Firmwide resiliency risk 
Disruptions of the Firm’s business and operations can 
occur due to forces beyond the Firm’s control such as 
the spread of infectious diseases or pandemics, severe 
weather, natural disasters, the effects of climate 
change, power or telecommunications loss, failure of a 
third party to provide expected services, cyberattacks, 
civil or political unrest or terrorism. The Firm’s 
resiliency framework is intended to enable the Firm to 
prepare for and adapt to changing conditions and 
withstand and recover from, and address adverse 
effects on its operations caused by, disruptions that 
may impact critical business functions and supporting 
assets, including its staff, technology, data and 
facilities, as well as those of third-party service 
providers. The framework includes governance, 
awareness training, planning and testing of recovery 
strategies, as well as strategic and tactical initiatives to 
identify, assess, and manage resiliency risks. The 
framework operates in accordance with the Firm’s 
overall approach to Operational Risk Management, 
including alignment with technology, cybersecurity, 
data, physical security, crisis management, real estate 
and outsourcing programs.
Payment fraud risk
Payment fraud risk is the risk of external and internal 
parties unlawfully obtaining personal monetary benefit 
through misdirected or otherwise improper payment. 
The Firm employs various controls for managing 
payment fraud risk as well as providing employee and 
client education and awareness trainings.
Third-party outsourcing risk
The Firm‘s Third-Party Oversight (“TPO”) and Interaffiliates Oversight (“IAO”) frameworks assist the LOBs 
and Corporate in selecting, documenting, onboarding, 
monitoring and managing their supplier relationships 
including services provided by affiliates. The 
objectives of the TPO framework are to hold suppliers 
and other third parties to an appropriate standard of 
operational performance and to mitigate key risks, 
including data loss and business disruptions. The 
Corporate Third-Party Oversight group is responsible 
for Firmwide training, monitoring, reporting and 
standards with respect to third-party outsourcing 
risks.

Cybersecurity risk
Cybersecurity risk is the risk of harm or loss resulting 
from misuse or abuse of technology or the 
unauthorized disclosure of data. 
Overview
Cybersecurity risk is an important and continuously 
evolving focus for the Firm. Significant resources are 
devoted to protecting and enhancing the security of 
computer systems, software, networks, storage 
devices, and other technology. The Firm’s security 
efforts are designed to protect against, among other 
things, cybersecurity attacks that can result in 
unauthorized access to confidential information, the 
destruction of data, disruptions to or degradations of 
service, the sabotaging of systems or other damage. 
The Firm has experienced, and expects that it will 
continue to experience, a higher volume and 
complexity of cyber attacks against the backdrop of 
heightened geopolitical tensions. The Firm has 
implemented measures and controls reasonably 
designed to address this evolving environment, 
including enhanced threat monitoring. In addition, the 
Firm continues to review and enhance its capabilities 
to address associated risks, such as those relating to 
the management of administrative access to systems.
Third parties with which the Firm does business, that 
facilitate the Firm’s business activities (e.g., vendors, 
supply chain, exchanges, clearing houses, central 
depositories, and financial intermediaries) or that the 
Firm has acquired are also sources of cybersecurity 
risk to the Firm. Third party incidents such as system 
breakdowns or failures, misconduct by the employees 
of such parties, or cyber attacks, including 
ransomware and supply-chain compromises, could 
have a material adverse effect on the Firm, including in 
circumstances in which an affected third party is 
unable to deliver a product or service to the Firm or 
where the incident delivers compromised software to 
the Firm or results in lost or compromised information 
of the Firm or its clients or customers.
Clients and customers are also sources of 
cybersecurity risk to the Firm and its information 
assets, particularly when their activities and systems 
are beyond the Firm’s own security and control 
systems. The Firm engages in periodic discussions 
with its clients, customers and other external parties 
concerning cybersecurity risks including opportunities 
to improve cybersecurity.
Risks from cybersecurity threats, including any 
previous cybersecurity events, have not materially 
affected the Firm or its business strategy, results of 
operations or financial condition. Notwithstanding the 
comprehensive approach that the Firm takes to 
address cybersecurity risk, the Firm may not be 
successful in preventing or mitigating a future 
cybersecurity incident that could have a material 
adverse effect on the Firm or its business strategy, 
results of operations or financial condition.
Organization and management 
The Global Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) 
reports to the Global Chief Information Officer, and is a 
member of key cybersecurity governance forums. The 
CISO leads the Global Cybersecurity and Technology 
Controls organization, which is responsible for 
identifying technology and cybersecurity risks and for 
implementing and maintaining controls to manage 
cybersecurity threats. The CISO and the members of 
senior management within Global Technology and the 
Cybersecurity and Technology Controls organizations 
all have relevant expertise and experience in 
cybersecurity and information technology risk 
management, including relevant experience at the 
Firm, at other financial services companies or in other 
highly-regulated industries.
The CISO is responsible for the Firm’s Information 
Security Program, which is designed to prevent, detect 
and respond to cyber attacks in order to help 
safeguard the confidentiality, integrity and availability 
of the Firm's infrastructure, resources and information. 
The program includes managing the Firm’s global 
cybersecurity operations centers, providing training, 
conducting cybersecurity event simulation exercises, 
implementing the Firm’s policies and standards 
relating to technology risk and cybersecurity 
management, and enhancing, as needed, the Firm’s 
cybersecurity capabilities. 
The Firm’s Information Security Program includes the 
following functions:
Cyber Operations, which is responsible for 
implementing and maintaining controls designed to 
detect and defend the Firm against cyber attacks, and 
includes a dedicated function for incident response 
and ongoing monitoring for cybersecurity threats and 
vulnerabilities, including those among the Firm’s thirdparty suppliers.
Technology Governance, Risk & Controls, which is 
responsible for operationalizing technology risk and 
control frameworks, analyzing regulatory 
developments that may impact the Firm, and 
developing control catalogs and assessments of 
controls, as well as overseeing governance and 
reporting of technology and cybersecurity risk.
Security Awareness, which provides awareness and 
training that reinforces information risk and security 
management practices and compliance with the Firm's 
policies, standards and practices. The training is 
mandatory for all employees globally on a periodic 
basis, and it is supplemented by Firmwide testing 
initiatives, including periodic phishing tests. The Firm 
also provides specialized security training to 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

employees in specific roles, such as application 
developers. The Firm’s Global Privacy Program 
requires all employees to take periodic training on 
data privacy that focuses on confidentiality and 
security, as well as responding to unauthorized access 
to or use of information.
Technology Resiliency, which establishes control 
requirements for planning and testing the prioritized 
recovery of technology services in the event of 
degradation or outage, including incident response 
planning, data backup and retention, and recovery 
readiness in support of the Firmwide Business 
Resiliency Program and operational risk management 
practices.
The Firm has a cybersecurity incident response plan 
designed to enable the Firm to respond to attempted 
cybersecurity incidents, coordinate as appropriate 
with law enforcement and other government agencies, 
notify clients and customers, as applicable, and 
recover from such incidents. In addition, the Firm 
actively partners with appropriate government and law 
enforcement agencies and peer industry forums, 
participating in discussions and simulations to assist in 
understanding the full spectrum of cybersecurity risks 
and in enhancing defenses and improving resiliency in 
the Firm’s operating environment.
Governance and oversight
The governance structure for the Global Cybersecurity 
and Technology Controls organization is designed to 
appropriately identify, escalate and mitigate 
cybersecurity risks. Cybersecurity risk management 
and its governance and oversight are integrated into 
the Firm’s operational risk management framework, 
including through the escalation of key risk and control 
issues to management and the development of risk 
mitigation plans for heightened risk and control issues. 
IRM independently assesses and challenges the 
activities and risk management practices of the Global 
Cybersecurity and Technology Controls organization 
related to the identification, assessment, 
measurement and mitigation of cybersecurity risk. As 
needed, the Firm engages third-party assessors or 
auditing firms with industry-recognized expertise on 
cybersecurity matters to review specific aspects of the 
Firm’s cybersecurity risk management framework, 
processes and controls.
The governance and oversight for cybersecurity risk 
management includes governance forums that inform 
management of key areas of concern regarding the 
prevention, detection, mitigation and remediation of 
cybersecurity risks. 
The Cybersecurity and Technology Controls Operating 
Committee (“CTOC”) is the principal management 
committee that oversees the Firm’s assessment and 
management of cybersecurity risk, including oversight 
of the implementation and maintenance of appropriate 
controls in support of the Firm’s Information Security 
Program. The membership of the CTOC includes 
senior representatives from the Global Cybersecurity 
and Technology Controls organization and relevant 
corporate functions, including IRM and Internal Audit. 
The CTOC escalates key operational risk and control 
issues, as appropriate, to the Global Technology 
Operating Committee (“GTOC”) or its business control 
committee or to the appropriate LOB and Corporate 
Control Committees. The GTOC is responsible for the 
governance of the Firmwide Global Technology 
organization, including oversight of Firmwide 
technology strategies, the delivery of technology and 
technology operations, the effective use of information 
technology resources, and monitoring and resolving 
key operational risk and control matters arising in the 
Global Technology organization.
As part of its oversight of management’s 
implementation and maintenance of the Firm’s risk 
management framework, the Firm’s Board of Directors 
receives periodic updates from the CIO, the CISO and 
senior members of the CTOC concerning 
cybersecurity matters. These updates generally 
include information regarding cybersecurity and 
technology developments, the Firm’s Information 
Security Program and recommended changes to that 
program, cybersecurity policies and practices, and 
ongoing initiatives to improve information security, as 
well as any significant cybersecurity incidents and the 
Firm's efforts to address those incidents. The Audit 
Committee and the Risk Committee assist the Board in 
this oversight.

COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT
Compliance risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is 
the risk of failing to comply with laws, rules, regulations 
or codes of conduct and standards of self-regulatory 
organizations. 
Overview
Each of the LOBs and Corporate hold primary 
ownership of and accountability for managing their 
compliance risk. The Firm’s Operational Risk and 
Compliance Organization (“Operational Risk and 
Compliance”), which is independent of the LOBs and 
Corporate, provides independent review, monitoring 
and oversight of business operations with a focus on 
compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations 
applicable to the delivery of the Firm’s products and 
services to clients and customers.
These compliance risks relate to a wide variety of laws, 
rules and regulations across the LOBs and Corporate, 
and jurisdictions, and include risks related to financial 
products and services, relationships and interactions 
with clients and customers, and employee activities. 
For example, compliance risks include those 
associated with anti-money laundering compliance, 
trading activities, market conduct, and complying with 
the laws, rules, and regulations related to the offering 
of products and services across jurisdictional borders. 
Compliance risk is also inherent in the Firm’s fiduciary 
activities, including the failure to exercise the 
applicable standard of care to act in the best interest 
of fiduciary clients and customers or to treat fiduciary 
clients and customers fairly.
Other functions provide oversight of significant 
regulatory obligations that are specific to their 
respective areas of responsibility.
Operational Risk and Compliance implements policies 
and standards designed to govern, identify, measure, 
monitor and test, manage, and report on compliance 
risk.
Governance and oversight
Operational Risk and Compliance is led by the Firm’s 
Global CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and 
Qualitative Risk Appetite.
The Firm maintains oversight and coordination of its 
compliance risk through the CCOR Management 
Framework. The Firm’s Global CCO and FRE for 
Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite also 
provides regular updates to the Board Risk Committee 
and the Audit Committee on significant compliance 
risk issues, as appropriate. 
Code of Conduct
The Firm has a Code of Conduct (the “Code”) that sets 
forth the Firm’s expectation that employees will 
conduct themselves with integrity, at all times. The 
Code provides the principles that help govern 
employee conduct with clients, customers, suppliers, 
vendors, shareholders, regulators, other employees, as 
well as with the markets and communities in which the 
Firm operates. The Code requires employees to 
promptly report any potential or actual violation of the 
Code, Firm policies, or laws, rules or regulations 
applicable to the Firm’s business. It also requires 
employees to report any illegal or unethical conduct, 
or conduct that violates the underlying principles of 
the Code, by any of the Firm’s employees, consultants, 
clients, customers, suppliers, contract or temporary 
workers, or business partners or agents. Training is 
assigned to newly hired employees after joining the 
Firm, and to current employees periodically thereafter. 
Employees are required to affirm their compliance with 
the Code annually. 
Employees can report any potential or actual violations 
of the Code through the Firm’s Conduct Hotline (the 
“Hotline”) by phone, mobile device or the internet. The 
Hotline is anonymous, where permitted by law, is 
available at all times globally, has translation services, 
and is administered by an outside service provider. 
The Code prohibits retaliation against anyone who 
raises an issue or concern in good faith or assists with 
an inquiry or investigation. Periodically, the Audit 
Committee receives reports on the Code of Conduct 
program.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

CONDUCT RISK MANAGEMENT
Conduct risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the 
risk that any action or misconduct by an employee 
could lead to unfair client or customer outcomes, 
impact the integrity of the markets in which the Firm 
operates, harm employees or the Firm, or compromise 
the Firm’s reputation.
Overview
Each LOB and Corporate is accountable for identifying 
and managing its conduct risk to provide appropriate 
engagement, ownership and sustainability of a culture 
consistent with the Firm’s Business Principles. The 
Business Principles serve as a guide for how 
employees are expected to conduct themselves. With 
the Business Principles serving as a guide, the Firm’s 
Code sets out the Firm’s expectations for each 
employee and provides information and resources to 
help employees conduct business ethically and in 
compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations 
everywhere the Firm operates. Refer to Compliance 
Risk Management on page 157 for further discussion of 
the Code.
Governance and oversight
The Firm’s oversight and coordination of conduct risk 
is managed in the same manner as Compliance risk. 
Refer to Compliance Risk Management on page 157 for 
further information.
Conduct risk management encompasses various 
aspects of people management practices throughout 
the employee life cycle, including recruiting, 
onboarding, training and development, performance 
management, promotion and compensation 
processes. Each LOB, Treasury and CIO, and each 
designated corporate function completes an 
assessment of conduct risk periodically, reviews 
metrics and issues which may involve conduct risk, 
and provides conduct education as appropriate. 
Management’s discussion and analysis

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

LEGAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Legal risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk 
of loss primarily caused by the actual or alleged failure 
to meet legal obligations that arise from the rule of law 
in jurisdictions in which the Firm operates, agreements 
with clients and customers, and products and services 
offered by the Firm. 
Overview
The global Legal function (“Legal”) provides legal 
services and advice to the Firm. Legal is responsible 
for managing the Firm’s exposure to legal risk by:
• managing actual and potential litigation and 
enforcement matters, including internal reviews and 
investigations related to such matters
• advising on products and services, including 
contract negotiation and documentation
• advising on offering and marketing documents and 
new business initiatives
• managing dispute resolution
• interpreting existing laws, rules and regulations, and 
advising on changes to them
• advising on advocacy in connection with 
contemplated and proposed laws, rules and 
regulations, and 
• providing legal advice to the LOBs, Corporate and 
the Board. 
Legal selects, engages and manages outside counsel 
for the Firm on all matters in which outside counsel is 
engaged. In addition, Legal advises the Firm’s Conflicts 
Office which reviews the Firm’s wholesale transactions 
that may have the potential to create conflicts of 
interest for the Firm. 
Governance and oversight
The Firm’s General Counsel reports to the CEO and is a 
member of the Operating Committee, the Firmwide 
Risk Committee and the Firmwide Control Committee. 
The Firm’s General Counsel and other members of 
Legal report on significant legal matters to the Firm’s 
Board of Directors and to the Audit Committee. 
Legal serves on and advises various committees and 
advises the Firm’s LOBs and Corporate on potential 
reputation risk issues.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

ESTIMATIONS AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT
Estimations and Model risk, a subcategory of 
operational risk, is the potential for adverse 
consequences from decisions based on incorrect or 
misused estimation outputs. 
The Firm uses models and other analytical and 
judgment-based estimations, including those based 
upon machine learning or artificial intelligence 
techniques, across various businesses and functions. 
The estimation methods are of varying levels of 
sophistication and are used for many purposes, such 
as the valuation of positions and measurement of risk, 
assessing regulatory capital requirements, conducting 
stress testing, evaluating the allowance for credit 
losses and making business decisions. A dedicated 
independent function, Model Risk Governance and 
Review (“MRGR”), defines and governs the Firm’s 
policies relating to the management of model risk and 
risks associated with certain analytical and judgmentbased estimations, such as those used in risk 
management, budget forecasting and capital planning 
and analysis. 
Model risks are owned by the users of the models 
within the LOBs and Corporate based on the specific 
purposes of such models. Users and developers of 
models are responsible for developing, implementing 
and testing their models, as well as referring models to 
MRGR for review and approval. Once models have 
been approved, model users and developers are 
responsible for maintaining a robust operating 
environment, and must monitor and evaluate the 
performance of the models on an ongoing basis. 
Model users and developers may seek to enhance 
models in response to changes in the relevant 
portfolios and in product and market developments, as 
well as to capture improvements in available modeling 
techniques and systems capabilities. 
Models are tiered based on an internal standard 
according to their complexity, the exposure associated 
with the model and the Firm’s reliance on the model. 
This tiering is subject to the approval of MRGR. In its 
review of a model, MRGR considers whether the model 
is suitable for the specific purposes for which it will be 
used. When reviewing a model, MRGR analyzes and 
challenges the model methodology and the 
reasonableness of model assumptions, and may 
perform or require additional testing, including backtesting of model outcomes. Model reviews are 
approved by the appropriate level of management 
within MRGR based on the relevant model tier.
Under the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk 
Management Policy, MRGR reviews and approves new 
models, as well as material changes to existing 
models, prior to their use. In certain circumstances, 
exceptions may be granted to the Firm’s policy to 
allow a model to be used prior to review or approval. 
MRGR may also require the user to take appropriate 
actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in 
the interim. These actions will depend on the model 
and may include, for example, limitation of trading 
activity.
While models are inherently imprecise, the degree of 
imprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the 
market or economic environment. This is particularly 
true when the current and forecasted environments 
are significantly different from the historical 
environments upon which the models were developed. 
This increased uncertainty may necessitate a greater 
degree of judgment and analytics to inform any 
adjustments that the Firm may make to model outputs 
than would otherwise be the case. In addition, the Firm 
may experience increased uncertainty in its estimates 
if assets acquired differ from those used to develop 
the models. 
Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the 
Firm on pages 161–164 and Note 2 for a summary of 
model-based valuations and other valuation 
techniques.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM 
JPMorganChase’s accounting policies and use of 
estimates are integral to understanding its reported 
results. The Firm’s most complex accounting 
estimates require management’s judgment to 
ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and 
liabilities. The Firm has established policies and 
control procedures intended to ensure that estimation 
methods, including any judgments made as part of 
such methods, are well-controlled, independently 
reviewed and applied consistently from period to 
period. The methods used and judgments made 
reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or 
liabilities and the related business and risk 
management strategies, which may vary across the 
Firm’s businesses and portfolios. In addition, the 
policies and procedures are intended to ensure that 
the process for changing methodologies occurs in an 
appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates 
for determining the carrying value of its assets and 
liabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief 
description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates 
involving significant judgments.
Allowance for credit losses
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents 
management’s estimate of expected credit losses over 
the remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial 
assets measured at amortized cost and certain offbalance sheet lending-related commitments. The 
allowance for credit losses generally comprises:
• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the 
Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and riskrated),
• The allowance for lending-related commitments, 
and
• The allowance for credit losses on investment 
securities.
The allowance for credit losses involves significant 
judgment on a number of matters including 
development and weighting of macroeconomic 
forecasts, incorporation of historical loss experience, 
assessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk 
ratings, valuation of collateral, and the determination 
of remaining expected life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 
13 for further information on these judgments as well 
as the Firm’s policies and methodologies used to 
determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses.
One of the most significant judgments involved in 
estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses 
relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to 
estimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast 
period within the Firm’s methodology. The eightquarter forecast incorporates hundreds of 
macroeconomic variables (“MEVs”) that are relevant 
for exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit 
losses being driven primarily by a subset of less than 
twenty variables. The specific variables that have the 
greatest effect on the modeled losses vary by portfolio 
and geography.
• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include 
regional U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. HPI.
• Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. 
unemployment, U.S. real GDP, U.S. equity prices, U.S. 
interest rates, U.S. corporate credit spreads, oil 
prices, U.S. commercial real estate prices and U.S. 
HPI.
Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of 
economic conditions could significantly affect its 
estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at 
the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes in 
the estimate from one reporting period to the next.
As a result of the First Republic acquisition, the Firm 
recorded an allowance for credit losses for the loans 
acquired and lending-related commitments assumed 
as of May 1, 2023. Due to differences in risk rating 
methodologies for the First Republic portfolio and the 
ongoing integration of products and systems, the 
allowance for credit losses for the acquired wholesale 
portfolio was initially measured based on similar risk 
characteristics from other facilities underwritten by 
the Firm. Starting in the second quarter of 2024, the 
acquired portfolio was incorporated into the Firm's 
modeled credit loss estimates and is now reflected in 
the wholesale sensitivity analysis below. Refer to Note 
34 for additional information on the First Republic 
acquisition. 
It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any 
one factor or input might affect the overall allowance 
for credit losses because management considers a 
wide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the 
allowance for credit losses. Changes in the factors and 
inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and 
may not be consistent across all geographies or 
product types, and changes in factors and inputs may 
be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in 
one factor or input may offset deterioration in others.
To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate 
macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the 
modeled credit losses determined using its central 
and relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which 
are two of the five scenarios considered in estimating 
the allowances for loan losses and lending-related 
commitments. The central and relative adverse 
scenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but 
differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of 
those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period. 
For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario 
shown on page 137 and in Note 13, the Firm’s relative 
adverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

unemployment rate, averaging approximately 2.1% 
higher over the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak 
difference of approximately 3.0% in the fourth quarter 
of 2025.
This analysis is not intended to estimate expected 
future changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a 
number of reasons, including:
• The allowance as of December 31, 2024, reflects 
credit losses beyond those estimated under the 
central scenario due to the weight placed on the 
adverse scenarios.
• The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both 
interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this 
analysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more 
severe changes in macroeconomic variables. 
• Expectations of future changes in portfolio 
composition and borrower behavior can significantly 
affect the allowance for credit losses.
To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates 
to macroeconomic forecasts as of December 31, 2024, 
the Firm compared the modeled estimates under its 
relative adverse scenario to its central scenario. 
Without considering offsetting or correlated effects in 
other qualitative components of the Firm’s allowance 
for credit losses, the comparison between these two 
scenarios for the exposures below reflect the following 
differences:
• An increase of approximately $850 million for 
residential real estate loans and lending-related 
commitments
• An increase of approximately $3.7 billion for credit 
card loans
• An increase of approximately $4.1 billion for 
wholesale loans and lending-related commitments
This analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss 
estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in 
the overall allowance for credit losses as it does not 
reflect any potential changes in other adjustments to 
the quantitative calculation, which would also be 
influenced by the judgment management applies to 
the modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the 
uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime 
loss estimates based on then-current circumstances 
and conditions.
Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic 
conditions are inherently uncertain, the Firm believes 
that its process to consider the available information 
and associated risks and uncertainties is appropriately 
governed and that its estimates of expected credit 
losses were reasonable and appropriate for the period 
ended December 31, 2024.
Fair value
JPMorganChase carries a portion of its assets and 
liabilities at fair value. The majority of such assets and 
liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring 
basis, including derivatives, structured note products 
and certain securities financing agreements. Certain 
assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a 
nonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage, home 
equity and other loans, where the carrying value is 
based on the fair value of the underlying collateral.
Assets measured at fair value 
The following table includes the Firm’s assets 
measured at fair value and the portion of such assets 
that are classified within level 3 of the fair value 
hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for further information.

Management’s discussion and analysis

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

Valuation
Details of the Firm’s processes for determining fair 
value are set out in Note 2. Estimating fair value 
requires the application of judgment. The type and level 
of judgment required is largely dependent on the 
amount of observable market information available to 
the Firm. For instruments valued using internally 
developed valuation models and other valuation 
techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and 
are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value 
hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are 
more significant than those required when estimating 
the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 
and 2.
In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument 
within level 3, management must first determine the 
appropriate valuation model or other valuation 
technique to use. Second, the lack of observability of 
certain significant inputs requires management to 
assess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation 
inputs including, for example, transaction details, yield 
curves, interest rates, prepayment speeds, default 
rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such as 
commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of 
comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and 
credit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of 
the valuation of level 3 instruments, including 
unobservable inputs used.
For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, 
management judgment must be applied to assess the 
appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect 
counterparty credit quality, the Firm’s creditworthiness, 
market funding rates, liquidity considerations, 
unobservable parameters, and for portfolios that meet 
specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. 
The judgments made are typically affected by the type 
of product and its specific contractual terms, and the 
level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a 
whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and 
uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider 
variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly 
for positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a 
further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by 
the Firm.
Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs 
or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss 
recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while 
the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate 
and consistent with those of other market participants, 
the methods and assumptions used reflect 
management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s 
businesses and portfolios.
The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions 
in the determination of fair value. The use of 
methodologies or assumptions different than those 
used by the Firm could result in a different estimate of 
fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for a 
detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process and 
hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for 
individual financial instruments.
Goodwill impairment 
Under U.S. GAAP, goodwill must be allocated to 
reporting units and tested for impairment at least 
annually. The Firm’s process and methodology used to 
conduct goodwill impairment testing is described in 
Note 15.
Management applies significant judgment when testing 
goodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with 
each business combination is allocated to the related 
reporting units for goodwill impairment testing.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Firm 
reviewed current economic conditions, estimated 
market cost of equity, as well as actual business results 
and projections of business performance. Based on 
such reviews, the Firm has concluded that goodwill was 
not impaired as of December 31, 2024. For each of the 
reporting units, fair value exceeded carrying value by at 
least 10% and there was no indication of a significant 
risk of goodwill impairment based on current 
projections and valuations. 
The projections for the Firm’s reporting units are 
consistent with management’s current business outlook 
assumptions in the short term, and the Firm’s best 
estimates of long-term growth and return on equity in 
the longer term. Where possible, the Firm uses thirdparty and peer data to benchmark its assumptions and 
estimates.
Refer to Note 15 for additional information on goodwill, 
including the goodwill impairment assessment as of 
December 31, 2024.
Credit card rewards liability
JPMorganChase offers credit cards with various 
rewards programs which allow cardholders to earn 
rewards points based on their account activity and the 
terms and conditions of the rewards program. 
Generally, there are no limits on the points that an 
eligible cardholder can earn, nor do the points expire, 
and the points can be redeemed for a variety of 
rewards, including cash (predominantly in the form of 
account credits), gift cards and travel. The Firm 
maintains a rewards liability which represents the 
estimated cost of rewards points earned and expected 
to be redeemed by cardholders. The liability is accrued 
as the cardholder earns the benefit and is reduced when 
the cardholder redeems points. This liability was $14.4 
billion and $13.2 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and 
other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. The 
increase in the liability was driven by continued growth 
in rewards points earned on higher spend and 
promotional offers outpacing redemptions throughout 
2024.
The rewards liability is sensitive to redemption rate 
(“RR”) and cost per point (“CPP”) assumptions. The RR 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

assumption is used to estimate the number of points 
earned by customers that will be redeemed over the life 
of the account. The CPP assumption is used to estimate 
the cost of future point redemptions. These 
assumptions are evaluated periodically considering 
historical actuals, cardholder redemption behavior and 
management judgment. Updates to these assumptions 
will impact the rewards liability. As of December 31, 
2024, a combined increase of 25 basis points in RR and 
1 basis point in CPP would increase the rewards liability 
by approximately $442 million.
Income taxes 

various jurisdictions in which it operates, including U.S. 
federal, state and local, and non-U.S. jurisdictions. 
These laws are often complex and may be subject to 
different interpretations. To determine the financial 
statement impact of accounting for income taxes, 
including the provision for income tax expense and 
unrecognized tax benefits, JPMorganChase must make 
assumptions and judgments about how to interpret and 
apply these complex tax laws to numerous transactions 
and business events, as well as make judgments 
regarding the timing of when certain items may affect 
taxable income in the U.S. and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.
JPMorganChase’s interpretations of tax laws around the 
world are subject to review and examination by the 
various taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where the 
Firm operates, and disputes may occur regarding its 
view on a tax position. These disputes over 
interpretations with the various taxing authorities may 
be settled by audit, administrative appeals or 
adjudication in the court systems of the tax jurisdictions 
in which the Firm operates. JPMorganChase regularly 
reviews whether it may be assessed additional income 
taxes as a result of the resolution of these matters, and 
the Firm records additional unrecognized tax benefits, 
as appropriate. In addition, the Firm may revise its 
estimate of income taxes due to changes in income tax 
laws, legal interpretations, and business strategies. It is 
possible that revisions in the Firm’s estimate of income 
taxes may materially affect the Firm’s results of 
operations in any reporting period.
Deferred taxes arise from differences between assets 
and liabilities measured for financial reporting versus 
income tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets are 
recognized if, in management’s judgment, their 
realizability is determined to be more likely than not. 
Deferred taxes are measured using enacted tax rates 
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in 
which those temporary differences are expected to be 
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a 
change in tax rates is recognized within the provision 
for income taxes in the period enacted.
The Firm has also recognized deferred tax assets in 
connection with certain tax attributes, including net 
operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and foreign tax 
credit (“FTC”) carryforwards. The Firm performs regular 
reviews to ascertain whether its deferred tax assets are 
realizable. These reviews include management’s 
estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable 
income, including foreign source income, and may 
incorporate various tax planning strategies, including 
strategies that may be available to utilize NOLs and 
FTCs before they expire. In connection with these 
reviews, if it is determined that a deferred tax asset is 
not realizable, a valuation allowance is established. The 
valuation allowance may be reversed in a subsequent 
reporting period if the Firm determines that, based on 
revised estimates of future taxable income or changes 
in tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not that 
all or part of the deferred tax asset will become 
realizable. As of December 31, 2024, management has 
determined it is more likely than not that the Firm will 
realize its deferred tax assets, net of the existing 
valuation allowance.
The Firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as 
necessary when new information becomes available, 
including changes in tax law and regulations, and 
interactions with taxing authorities. Uncertain tax 
positions that meet the more-likely-than-not 
recognition threshold are measured to determine the 
amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax 
position is measured at the largest amount of benefit 
that management believes is more likely than not to be 
realized upon settlement. It is possible that the 
reassessment of JPMorganChase’s unrecognized tax 
benefits may have a material impact on its effective 
income tax rate in the period in which the reassessment 
occurs. Although the Firm believes that its estimates 
are reasonable, the final tax amount could be different 
from the amounts reflected in the Firm’s income tax 
provisions and accruals. To the extent that the final 
outcome of these amounts is different than the amounts 
recorded, such differences will generally impact the 
Firm’s provision for income taxes in the period in which 
such a determination is made.
The Firm’s provision for income taxes is composed of 
current and deferred taxes. The current and deferred 
tax provisions are calculated based on estimates and 
assumptions that could differ from the actual results 
reflected in income tax returns filed during the 
subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns 
are generally recorded in the period when the tax 
returns are filed and the global tax implications are 
known, which could impact the Firm’s effective tax rate.

taxes.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
From time to time, the Firm has made and will make 
forward-looking statements. These statements can be 
identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to 
historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements 
often use words such as “anticipate,” “target,” “expect,” 
“estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “believe,” or other 
words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements 
provide JPMorganChase’s current expectations or 
forecasts of future events, circumstances, results or 
aspirations. JPMorganChase’s disclosures in this 2024 
Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements within

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

Management of JPMorgan Chase & Co. 
(“JPMorganChase” or the “Firm”) is responsible for 
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control 
over financial reporting. Internal control over financial 
reporting is a process designed by, or under the 
supervision of, the Firm’s principal executive and 
principal financial officers, or persons performing 
similar functions, and effected by JPMorganChase’s 
Board of Directors, management and other personnel, 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of 
financial statements for external purposes in 
accordance with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).
JPMorganChase’s internal control over financial 
reporting includes those policies and procedures that 
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records, that, in 
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the Firm’s assets; (2) 
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are 
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that 
receipts and expenditures of the Firm are being made 
only in accordance with authorizations of 
JPMorganChase’s management and directors; and (3) 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or 
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or 
disposition of the Firm’s assets that could have a 
material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over 
financial reporting may not prevent or detect 
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of 
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk 
that controls may become inadequate because of 
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance 
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
Management has completed an assessment of the 
effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over financial 
reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making the 
assessment, management used the “Internal Control — 
Integrated Framework” (“COSO 2013”) promulgated by 
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the 
Treadway Commission (“COSO”).
Based upon the assessment performed, management 
concluded that as of December 31, 2024, 
JPMorganChase’s internal control over financial 
reporting was effective based upon the COSO 2013 
framework. Additionally, based upon management’s 
assessment, the Firm determined that there were no 
material weaknesses in its internal control over financial 
reporting as of December 31, 2024.
The effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over 
financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, has been 
audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an 
independent registered public accounting firm, as 
stated in their report which appears herein.

Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of 
JPMorgan Chase & Co.:
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal 
Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated 
balance sheets of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its 
subsidiaries (the “Firm”) as of December 31, 2024 and 
2023, and the related consolidated statements of 
income, comprehensive income, changes in 
stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three 
years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including 
the related notes (collectively referred to as the 
“consolidated financial statements”). We also have 
audited the Firm’s internal control over financial 
reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria 
established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements 
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, 
the financial position of the Firm as of December 31, 
2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its 
cash flows for each of the three years in the period 
ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with 
accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America. Also in our opinion, the Firm 
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal 
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 
2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – 
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
Basis for Opinions
The Firm’s management is responsible for these 
consolidated financial statements, for maintaining 
effective internal control over financial reporting, and for 
its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control 
over financial reporting, included in the accompanying 
Management’s report on internal control over financial 
reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on 
the Firm’s consolidated financial statements and on the 
Firm’s internal control over financial reporting based on 
our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered 
with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be 
independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with 
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules 
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the 
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that 
we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the consolidated financial 
statements are free of material misstatement, whether 
due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal 
control over financial reporting was maintained in all 
material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements 
included performing procedures to assess the risks of 
material misstatement of the consolidated financial 
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and 
performing procedures that respond to those risks. 
Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, 
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the 
consolidated financial statements. Our audits also 
included evaluating the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as 
evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated 
financial statements. Our audit of internal control over 
financial reporting included obtaining an understanding 
of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the 
risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and 
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of 
internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits 
also included performing such other procedures as we 
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe 
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our 
opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over 
Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a 
process designed to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the 
preparation of financial statements for external 
purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over 
financial reporting includes those policies and 
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of 
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of 
the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles, and that 
receipts and expenditures of the company are being 
made only in accordance with authorizations of 
management and directors of the company; and 
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention 
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a 
material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over 
financial reporting may not prevent or detect 
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of 
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk 
that controls may become inadequate because of 
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance 
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are 
matters arising from the current period audit of the 
consolidated financial statements that were 
communicated or required to be communicated to the 
audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or 
disclosures that are material to the consolidated 
financial statements and (ii) involved our especially 
challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The 
communication of critical audit matters does not alter 
in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by 
communicating the critical audit matters below, 
providing separate opinions on the critical audit 
matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which 
they relate.
Allowance for Loan Losses – Portfolio-based 
component of Wholesale Loan and Credit Card Loan 
Portfolios 
As described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial 
statements, the allowance for loan losses for the 
portfolio-based component of the wholesale and 
credit card loan portfolios was $22.0 billion on total 
portfolio-based retained loans of $919.3 billion at 
December 31, 2024. The Firm’s allowance for loan 
losses represents management’s estimate of expected 
credit losses over the remaining expected life of the 
Firm's loan portfolios and considers expected future 
changes in macroeconomic conditions. The portfoliobased component of the Firm’s allowance for loan 
losses for the wholesale and credit card retained loan 
portfolios begins with a quantitative calculation of 
expected credit losses over the expected life of the 
loan by applying credit loss factors to the estimated 
exposure at default. The credit loss factors applied are 
determined based on the weighted average of five 
internally developed macroeconomic scenarios that 
take into consideration the Firm's economic outlook as 
derived through forecast macroeconomic variables, 
the most significant of which are U.S. unemployment 
and U.S. real gross domestic product. This quantitative 
calculation is further adjusted to take into 
consideration model imprecision, emerging risk 
assessments, trends and other subjective factors that 
are not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss 
estimate.
The principal considerations for our determination that 
performing procedures relating to the allowance for 
loan losses for the portfolio-based component of the 
wholesale and credit card loan portfolios is a critical 
audit matter are (i) the significant judgment and 
estimation by management in the forecast of 
macroeconomic variables, specifically U.S. 
unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product, 
as the Firm’s forecasts of economic conditions 
significantly affect its estimate of expected credit 
losses at the balance sheet date, (ii) the significant 
judgment and estimation by management in 
determining the quantitative calculation utilized in 
their credit loss estimates and the adjustments to take 
into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk 
assessments, trends and other subjective factors that 
are not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss 
estimate, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor 
judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing 
procedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained 
relating to the credit loss estimates and the 
appropriateness of the adjustments to the credit loss 
estimates, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of 
professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.
Addressing the matter involved performing 
procedures and evaluating audit evidence in 
connection with forming our overall opinion on the 
consolidated financial statements. These procedures 
included testing the effectiveness of controls relating 
to the Firm’s allowance for loan losses, including 
controls over model validation and generation of 
macroeconomic scenarios. These procedures also 
included, among others, testing management’s 
process for estimating the allowance for loan losses, 
which involved (i) evaluating the appropriateness of 
the models and methodologies used in quantitative 
calculations; (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of 
forecasts of U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross 
domestic product; (iii) testing the completeness and 
accuracy of data used in the estimate; and (iv) 
evaluating the reasonableness of management’s 
adjustments to the quantitative output for the impacts 
of model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, 
trends and other subjective factors that are not yet 
otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate. These 
procedures also included the use of professionals with 
specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating 
the appropriateness of certain models, methodologies 
and macroeconomic variables.
Fair Value of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments
As described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated 
financial statements, the Firm carries $1.5 trillion of its 
assets and $586.2 billion of its liabilities at fair value on 
a recurring basis. Included in these balances are $10.9 
billion of trading assets and $51.8 billion of liabilities 
measured at fair value on a recurring basis, collectively 
financial instruments, which are classified as level 3 as 
they contain one or more inputs to valuation which are 
unobservable and significant to their fair value 
measurement. The Firm utilized internally developed 
valuation models and unobservable inputs to estimate 
fair value of the level 3 financial instruments. The 
unobservable inputs used by management to estimate 
the fair value of certain of these financial instruments 
include interest rate volatility, equity volatility, 
Bermudan switch value and correlation relating to 
interest rates, interest rate-to-foreign exchange, 
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

equity prices, equity-to-foreign exchange and equityto-interest rate.
The principal considerations for our determination that 
performing procedures relating to the fair value of 
certain level 3 financial instruments is a critical audit 
matter are (i) the significant judgment and estimation 
by management in determining the inputs to estimate 
fair value, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor 
judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing 
procedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained 
related to the fair value of these financial instruments, 
and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of 
professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.
Addressing the matter involved performing 
procedures and evaluating audit evidence in 
connection with forming our overall opinion on the 
consolidated financial statements. These procedures 
included testing the effectiveness of controls relating 
to the Firm’s determination of the fair value, including 
controls over models, inputs, and data. These 
procedures also included, among others, the 
involvement of professionals with specialized skill and 
knowledge to assist in developing an independent 
estimate of fair value for a sample of these financial 
instruments and comparing management’s estimate 
to the independently developed estimate of fair value. 
Developing the independent estimate involved testing 
the completeness and accuracy of data provided by 
management, developing independent inputs and, as 
appropriate, evaluating and utilizing management’s 
aforementioned unobservable inputs.

JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Consolidated statements of cash flows

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

Note 1 – Basis of presentation
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorganChase” or the 
“Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated 
under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading financial 
services firm based in the U.S., with operations 
worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, 
financial services for consumers and small businesses, 
commercial banking, financial transaction processing 
and asset management. Refer to Note 32 for further 
discussion of the Firm's reportable business 
segments.
The accounting and financial reporting policies of 
JPMorganChase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. 
GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies 
conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines 
prescribed by regulatory authorities.
Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the 
accounts of JPMorganChase and other entities in 
which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All 
material intercompany balances and transactions have 
been eliminated.
Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary 
capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorganChase 
and are not included on the Consolidated balance 
sheets.
The Firm determines whether it has a controlling 
financial interest in an entity by first evaluating 
whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a 
variable interest entity. 
Voting interest entities
Voting interest entities are entities that have sufficient 
equity and provide the equity investors voting rights 
that enable them to make significant decisions relating 
to the entity’s operations. For these types of entities, 
the Firm’s determination of whether it has a controlling 
interest is primarily based on the amount of voting 
equity interests held. Entities in which the Firm has a 
controlling financial interest, through ownership of the 
majority of the entities’ voting equity interests, or 
through other contractual rights that give the Firm 
control, are consolidated by the Firm.
Investments in companies in which the Firm has 
significant influence over operating and financing 
decisions (but does not own a majority of the voting 
equity interests) are accounted for (i) in accordance 
with the equity method of accounting, or (ii) at fair 
value if the fair value option was elected. These 
investments are generally included in other assets, 
with income or loss included in noninterest revenue.
Certain Firm-sponsored asset management funds are 
structured as limited partnerships or limited liability 
companies. For many of these entities, the Firm is the 
general partner or managing member, but the nonaffiliated partners or members have the ability to 
remove the Firm as the general partner or managing 
member without cause (i.e., kick-out rights), based on 
a simple majority vote, or the non-affiliated partners or 
members have rights to participate in important 
decisions. Accordingly, the Firm does not consolidate 
these voting interest entities. However, in the limited 
cases where the non-managing partners or members 
do not have substantive kick-out or participating 
rights, the Firm evaluates the funds as VIEs and 
consolidates the funds if the Firm is the general 
partner or managing member and has both power and 
a potentially significant interest. 
The Firm’s investment companies and asset 
management funds have investments in both publiclyheld and privately-held entities, including investments 
in buyouts, growth equity and venture opportunities. 
These investments are accounted for under 
investment company guidelines and, accordingly, 
irrespective of the percentage of equity ownership 
interests held, are carried on the Consolidated balance 
sheets at fair value, and are recorded in other assets, 
with income or loss included in noninterest revenue. If 
consolidated, the Firm retains the accounting under 
such specialized investment company guidelines.
Variable interest entities 
VIEs are entities that, by design, either (1) lack 
sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its 
activities without additional subordinated financial 
support from other parties, or (2) have equity investors 
that do not have the ability to make significant 
decisions relating to the entity’s operations through 
voting rights, or do not have the obligation to absorb 
the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive 
the residual returns of the entity.
The most common type of VIE is an SPE. SPEs are 
commonly used in securitization transactions in order 
to isolate certain assets and distribute the cash flows 
from those assets to investors. The basic SPE 
structure involves a company selling assets to the SPE; 
the SPE funds the purchase of those assets by issuing 
securities to investors. The legal documents that 
govern the transaction specify how the cash earned on 
the assets must be allocated to the SPE’s investors 
and other parties that have rights to those cash flows. 
SPEs are generally structured to insulate investors 
from claims on the SPE’s assets by creditors of other 
entities, including the creditors of the seller of the 
assets. 
The primary beneficiary of a VIE (i.e., the party that has 
a controlling financial interest) is required to 
consolidate the assets and liabilities of the VIE. The 
Notes to consolidated financial statements
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

primary beneficiary is the party that has both (1) the 
power to direct the activities of the VIE that most 
significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; 
and (2) through its interests in the VIE, the obligation 
to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from 
the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
To assess whether the Firm has the power to direct the 
activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the 
VIE’s economic performance, the Firm considers all 
the facts and circumstances, including its role in 
establishing the VIE and its ongoing rights and 
responsibilities. This assessment includes, first, 
identifying the activities that most significantly impact 
the VIE’s economic performance; and second, 
identifying which party, if any, has power over those 
activities. In general, the parties that make the most 
significant decisions affecting the VIE (such as asset 
managers, collateral managers, servicers, or owners of 
call options or liquidation rights over the VIE’s assets) 
or have the right to unilaterally remove those decisionmakers are deemed to have the power to direct the 
activities of a VIE.
To assess whether the Firm has the obligation to 
absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits 
from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the 
VIE, the Firm considers all of its economic interests, 
including debt and equity investments, servicing fees, 
and derivatives or other arrangements deemed to be 
variable interests in the VIE. This assessment requires 
that the Firm apply judgment in determining whether 
these interests, in the aggregate, are considered 
potentially significant to the VIE. Factors considered in 
assessing significance include: the design of the VIE, 
including its capitalization structure; subordination of 
interests; payment priority; relative share of interests 
held across various classes within the VIE’s capital 
structure; and the reasons why the interests are held 
by the Firm.
The Firm performs on-going reassessments of: (1) 
whether entities previously evaluated under the 
majority voting-interest framework have become VIEs, 
based on certain events, and are therefore subject to 
the VIE consolidation framework; and (2) whether 
changes in the facts and circumstances regarding the 
Firm’s involvement with a VIE cause the Firm’s 
consolidation conclusion to change.
Refer to Note 14 for further discussion of Firmsponsored VIEs.
Revenue recognition 
Interest income 
The Firm recognizes interest income on loans, debt 
securities, and other debt instruments, generally on a 
level-yield basis, based on the underlying contractual 
rate. Refer to Note 7 for further information.
Revenue from contracts with customers 
JPMorganChase recognizes noninterest revenue from 
certain contracts with customers, in investment 
banking fees, deposit-related fees, asset management 
fees, commissions and other fees, and components of 
card income, when the Firm’s related performance 
obligations are satisfied. Refer to Note 6 for further 
discussion of the Firm’s revenue from contracts with 
customers. 
Principal transactions revenue 
JPMorganChase carries a portion of its assets and 
liabilities at fair value. Changes in fair value are 
reported primarily in principal transactions revenue. 
Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for further discussion of fair 
value measurement. Refer to Note 6 for further 
discussion of principal transactions revenue. 
Use of estimates in the preparation of consolidated 
financial statements
The preparation of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements requires management to make estimates 
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 
assets and liabilities, revenue and expense, and 
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual 
results could be different from these estimates.
Foreign currency translation
JPMorganChase revalues assets, liabilities, revenue 
and expense denominated in non-U.S. currencies into 
U.S. dollars using applicable exchange rates.
Gains and losses relating to translating functional 
currency financial statements for U.S. reporting are 
included in the Consolidated statements of 
comprehensive income. Gains and losses relating to 
nonfunctional currency transactions, including nonU.S. operations where the functional currency is the 
U.S. dollar, are reported in the Consolidated 
statements of income.
Offsetting assets and liabilities
U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative 
receivables and derivative payables with the same 
counterparty and the related cash collateral 
receivables and payables on a net basis on the 
Consolidated balance sheets when a legally 
enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. 
GAAP also permits securities sold and purchased 
under repurchase agreements and securities 
borrowed or loaned under securities loan agreements 
to be presented net when specified conditions are met, 
including the existence of a legally enforceable master 
netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such 
balances where it has determined that the specified 
conditions are met.
The Firm uses master netting agreements to mitigate 
counterparty credit risk in certain transactions, 
including derivative contracts, resale, repurchase, 
securities borrowed and securities loaned 
Notes to consolidated financial statements

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

agreements. A master netting agreement is a single 
agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple 
transactions governed by that agreement to be 
terminated or accelerated and settled through a single 
payment in a single currency in the event of a default 
(e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment 
or securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin 
when due). Upon the exercise of derivatives 
termination rights by the non-defaulting party (i) all 
transactions are terminated, (ii) all transactions are 
valued and the positive values of “in the money” 
transactions are netted against the negative values of 
“out of the money” transactions and (iii) the only 
remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties 
to pay the netted termination amount. Upon exercise 
of default rights under repurchase agreements and 
securities loan agreements in general (i) all 
transactions are terminated and accelerated, (ii) all 
values of securities or cash held or to be delivered are 
calculated, and all such sums are netted against each 
other and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is 
of one of the parties to pay the netted termination 
amount.
Typical master netting agreements for these types of 
transactions also often contain a collateral/margin 
agreement that provides for a security interest in, or 
title transfer of, securities or cash collateral/margin to 
the party that has the right to demand margin (the 
“demanding party”). The collateral/margin agreement 
typically requires a party to transfer collateral/margin 
to the demanding party with a value equal to the 
amount of the margin deficit on a net basis across all 
transactions governed by the master netting 
agreement, less any threshold. The collateral/margin 
agreement grants to the demanding party, upon 
default by the counterparty, the right to set-off any 
amounts payable by the counterparty against any 
posted collateral or the cash equivalent of any posted 
collateral/margin. It also grants to the demanding 
party the right to liquidate collateral/margin and to 
apply the proceeds to an amount payable by the 
counterparty.

derivative instruments. Refer to Note 11 for further

agreements. 
Statements of cash flows
For JPMorganChase’s Consolidated statements of 
cash flows, cash is defined as those amounts included 
in cash and due from banks and deposits with banks 
on the Consolidated balance sheets.
Accounting standard adopted January 1, 2024
Equity Method and Joint Ventures: Accounting for 
Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the 
Proportional Amortization Method 
The guidance expanded the types of tax-oriented 
investments, beyond affordable housing tax credit 
investments, that the Firm can elect on a program by 
program basis, to be accounted for using the 
proportional amortization method. This method 
requires the cost of eligible investments, within an 
elected program, to be amortized in proportion to the 
tax benefits received with the resulting amortization 
reported directly in income tax expense, which aligns 
with the associated tax credits and other tax benefits. 
Eligible investments must meet certain criteria, 
including that substantially all of the return is from 
income tax credits and other income tax benefits.
This guidance was adopted on January 1, 2024 under 
the modified retrospective method. The adoption of 
this guidance resulted in a change to the classification 
and timing of the amortization associated with certain 
of the Firm's alternative energy tax-oriented 
investments. As a result of the adoption, the 
amortization of these investments that was previously 
recognized in other income is now recognized in 
income tax expense. The change in accounting 
resulted in a decrease to retained earnings of $161 
million and increased the Firm’s income tax expense 
and the effective tax rate by approximately $450 
million and two percentage points, respectively, in the 
first quarter of 2024, with no material impact to net 
income.
The guidance requires additional disclosure for all 
investments that generate income tax credits and 
other income tax benefits from a tax-oriented 
investment program for which the Firm has elected to 
apply the proportional amortization method. The 
guidance also requires a reevaluation of eligible 
investments when significant modifications or events 
occur that result in a change in the nature of the 
investment or a change in the Firm's relationship with 
the underlying project.
Refer to Notes 6, 14 and 25 for additional information.
Accounting standards adopted January 1, 2023
Derivatives and Hedging: Fair Value Hedging – 
Portfolio Layer Method
The adoption of this guidance expanded the ability to 
hedge a portfolio of fixed-rate assets in a qualifying 
hedge accounting relationship. As permitted by the 
guidance, the Firm elected to transfer HTM securities 
to AFS and designated those securities in a portfolio 
layer method hedge upon adoption. The adoption 
impact of the transfer on retained earnings was not 
material.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

Financial Instruments – Credit Losses: Troubled 
Debt Restructurings (“TDRs”) 
The adoption of this guidance eliminated the 
requirement to measure the allowance for TDRs using 
a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) methodology and 
allowed the option of a non-DCF portfolio-based 
approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers. 
The Firm elected this option for all portfolios of 
modified loans to troubled borrowers except 
collateral-dependent loans and nonaccrual risk-rated 
loans, for which the Firm elected to continue applying 
a DCF methodology. The adoption of this guidance 
under the modified retrospective method on January 1, 
2023, resulted in a $446 million increase to retained 
earnings.

Note 2 – Fair value measurement
JPMorganChase carries a portion of its assets and 
liabilities at fair value. These assets and liabilities are 
predominantly carried at fair value on a recurring basis 
(i.e., assets and liabilities that are measured and 
reported at fair value on the Firm’s Consolidated 
balance sheets). Certain assets, liabilities and 
unfunded lending-related commitments are measured 
at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, they are 
not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are 
subject to fair value adjustments only in certain 
circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of 
impairment).
Fair value is defined as the price that would be 
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in 
an orderly transaction between market participants at 
the measurement date. Fair value is based on quoted 
market prices or inputs, where available. If prices or 
quotes are not available, fair value is based on 
valuation models and other valuation techniques that 
consider relevant transaction characteristics (such as 
maturity) and use, as inputs, observable or 
unobservable market parameters, including yield 
curves, interest rates, volatilities, prices (such as 
commodity, equity or debt prices), correlations, 
foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Fair value 
may also incorporate valuation adjustments. 
The level of precision in estimating unobservable 
market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of 
gain or loss recorded for a particular position. 
Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation 
methods are appropriate and consistent with those of 
other market participants, the methods and 
assumptions used reflect management judgment and 
may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. 
The Firm uses various methodologies and 
assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use 
of different methodologies or assumptions by other 
market participants compared with those used by the 
Firm could result in the Firm deriving a different 
estimate of fair value at the reporting date. 
Valuation process 
Risk-taking functions are responsible for providing fair 
value estimates for assets and liabilities carried on the 
Consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The Firm’s 
Valuation Control Group (“VCG”), which is part of the 
Firm’s Finance function and independent of the risktaking functions, is responsible for verifying these 
estimates and determining any fair value adjustments 
that may be required to ensure that the Firm’s 
positions are recorded at fair value. In addition, the 
Firm’s Valuation Governance Forum (“VGF”), which is 
composed of senior finance and risk executives, is 
responsible for overseeing the management of risks 
arising from valuation activities conducted across the 
Firm. The Firmwide VGF is chaired by the Firmwide 
head of the VCG (under the direction of the Firm’s 
Controller), and includes sub-forums covering the CIB, 
CCB, AWM and certain corporate functions including 
Treasury and CIO. 
Price verification process 
The VCG verifies fair value estimates provided by the 
risk-taking functions by leveraging independently 
derived prices, valuation inputs and other market data, 
where available. Where independent prices or inputs 
are not available, the VCG performs additional review 
to ensure the reasonableness of the estimates. The 
additional review may include evaluating the limited 
market activity including client unwinds, 
benchmarking valuation inputs to those used for 
similar instruments, decomposing the valuation of 
structured instruments into individual components, 
comparing expected to actual cash flows, reviewing 
profit and loss trends, and reviewing trends in 
collateral valuation. There are also additional levels of 
management review for more significant or complex 
positions.
The VCG determines any valuation adjustments that 
may be required to the estimates provided by the risktaking functions. No adjustments to quoted prices are 
applied for instruments classified within level 1 of the 
fair value hierarchy (refer to the discussion of the fair 
value hierarchy on page 182 for further information). 
For other positions, judgment is required to assess the 
need for valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect 
liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, 
and, for certain portfolios that meet specified criteria, 
the size of the net open risk position. The 
determination of such adjustments follows a 
consistent framework across the Firm:
• Liquidity valuation adjustments are considered 
where an observable external price or valuation 
parameter exists but is of lower reliability, potentially 
due to lower market activity. Liquidity valuation 
adjustments are made based on current market 
conditions. Factors that may be considered in 
determining the liquidity adjustment include 
analysis of: (1) the estimated bid-offer spread for the 
instrument being traded; (2) alternative pricing 
points for similar instruments in active markets; and 
(3) the range of reasonable values that the price or 
parameter could take. 
• The Firm manages certain portfolios of financial 
instruments on the basis of net open risk exposure 
and, as permitted by U.S. GAAP, has elected to 
estimate the fair value of such portfolios on the basis 
of a transfer of the entire net open risk position in an 
orderly transaction. Where this is the case, valuation 
adjustments may be necessary to reflect the cost of 
exiting a larger-than-normal market-size net open 
risk position. Where applied, such adjustments are 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

based on factors that a relevant market participant 
would consider in the transfer of the net open risk 
position, including the size of the adverse market 
move that is likely to occur during the period 
required to sufficiently reduce the net open risk 
position. 
• Uncertainty adjustments related to unobservable 
parameters may be made when positions are valued 
using prices or input parameters to valuation models 
that are unobservable due to a lack of market 
activity or because they cannot be implied from 
observable market data. Such prices or parameters 
must be estimated and are, therefore, subject to 
management judgment. Adjustments are made to 
reflect the uncertainty inherent in the resulting 
valuation estimate. 
• Where appropriate, the Firm also applies 
adjustments to its estimates of fair value in order to 
appropriately reflect counterparty credit quality 
(CVA), the Firm’s own creditworthiness (DVA) and 
the impact of funding (FVA), using a consistent 
framework across the Firm. Refer to Credit and 
funding adjustments on page 198 of this Note for 
more information on such adjustments.
Valuation model review and approval 
If prices or quotes are not available for an instrument 
or a similar instrument, fair value is generally 
determined using valuation models that consider 
relevant transaction terms such as maturity and use as 
inputs market-based or independently sourced 
parameters. Where this is the case the price 
verification process described above is applied to the 
inputs in those models. 
Under the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk 
Management Policy, MRGR reviews and approves new 
models, as well as material changes to existing 
models, prior to implementation in the operating 
environment. In certain circumstances exceptions may 
be granted to the Firm’s policy to allow a model to be 
used prior to review or approval. MRGR may also 
require the user to take appropriate actions to mitigate 
the model risk if it is to be used in the interim. These 
actions will depend on the model and may include, for 
example, limitation of trading activity. 
Fair value hierarchy 
A three-level fair value hierarchy has been established 
under U.S. GAAP for disclosure of fair value 
measurements. The fair value hierarchy is based on 
the observability of inputs to the valuation of an asset 
or liability as of the measurement date. The three 
levels are defined as follows. 
• Level 1 – inputs to the valuation methodology are 
quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or 
liabilities in active markets. 
• Level 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology 
include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities 
in active markets, and inputs that are observable for 
the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for 
substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
• Level 3 – one or more inputs to the valuation 
methodology are unobservable and significant to the 
fair value measurement. 
A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair 
value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input 
that is significant to the fair value measurement.

Derivatives
Actively traded derivatives, e.g., exchange-traded derivatives, 
that are valued using quoted prices.
Level 1
Derivatives that are valued using models such as the BlackScholes option pricing model, simulation models, or a 
combination of models that may use observable or 
unobservable valuation inputs as well as considering the 
contractual terms.
The key valuation inputs used will depend on the type of 
derivative and the nature of the underlying instruments and may 
include equity prices, commodity prices, foreign exchange 
rates, volatilities, correlations, CDS spreads, recovery rates and 
prepayment speed.
Level 2 or 3
In addition, specific inputs used for derivatives that are valued 
based on models with significant unobservable inputs are as 
follows:
Interest rate and FX exotic derivatives specific inputs include:
• Interest rate curve
• Interest rate volatility
• Interest rate spread volatility
• Bermudan switch value
• Interest rate correlation
• Interest rate-FX correlation
• Foreign exchange correlation
Credit derivatives specific inputs include:
• Credit correlation between the underlying debt instruments
Equity derivatives specific inputs include:

Level 3
Private equity direct 
investments
Fair value is estimated using all available information; the range 
of potential inputs include:
Level 2 or 3
• Transaction prices
• Trading multiples of comparable public companies
• Operating performance of the underlying portfolio company
• Adjustments as required, since comparable public 
companies are not identical to the company being valued, 
and for company-specific issues including lack of liquidity
• Additional available inputs relevant to the investment

Valued using observable market information, where available.
Level 2 or 3
In the absence of observable market information, valuations are 
based on the fair value of the underlying assets held by the VIE.
Structured notes (included 
in deposits, short-term 
borrowings and long-term 
debt)
Valuations are based on discounted cash flow analyses that 
consider the embedded derivative and the terms and payment 
structure of the note.
The embedded derivative features are considered using models 
such as the Black-Scholes option pricing model, simulation 
models, or a combination of models that may use observable or 
unobservable valuation inputs, depending on the embedded 
derivative. The specific inputs used vary according to the nature 
of the embedded derivative features, as described in the 
discussion above regarding derivatives valuation. Adjustments 
are then made to this base valuation to reflect the Firm’s own 
credit risk (DVA). Refer to page 198 of this Note.
Level 2 or 3
(a) Excludes certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient.

(a) At December 31, 2024 and 2023, included total U.S. GSE obligations of $120.1 billion and $78.5 billion, respectively, which were mortgagerelated.
(b) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net realizable value” is a term 
defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities 
inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the 
Firm’s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying 
value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in 
fair value. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure 
information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented.

(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not 
required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At both December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair values of these investments, which include 
certain hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $1.0 billion, primarily reported in other assets.
(e) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral 
received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, 
including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.

Level 3 valuations
The Firm has established well-structured processes for 
determining fair value, including for instruments where 
fair value is estimated using significant unobservable 
inputs (level 3). Refer to pages 181–185 of this Note for 
further information on the Firm’s valuation process and 
a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value 
for individual financial instruments. 
Estimating fair value requires the application of 
judgment. The type and level of judgment required is 
largely dependent on the amount of observable market 
information available to the Firm. For instruments 
valued using internally developed valuation models and 
other valuation techniques that use significant 
unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within 
level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to 
estimate fair value are more significant than those 
required when estimating the fair value of instruments 
classified within levels 1 and 2. 
In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument 
within level 3, management must first determine the 
appropriate valuation model or other valuation 
technique to use. Second, due to the lack of 
observability of significant inputs, management must 
assess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation 
inputs including transaction details, yield curves, 
interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates, 
volatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, 
equity or debt prices), valuations of comparable 
instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. 
The following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3 
financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to 
measure the fair value of those financial instruments, 
the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values 
for those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic 
averages of such inputs. While the determination to 
classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the 
significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall 
fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments 
typically include observable components (that is, 
components that are actively quoted and can be 
validated to external sources) in addition to the 
unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 
inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm 
manages the risk of the observable components of level 
3 financial instruments using securities and derivative 
positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair 
value hierarchy. 
The range of values presented in the table is 
representative of the highest and lowest level input 
used to value the significant groups of instruments 
within a product/instrument classification. Where 
provided, the weighted averages of the input values 
presented in the table are calculated based on the fair 
value of the instruments that the input is being used to 
value. 
In the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and 
arithmetic average values do not reflect the degree of 
input uncertainty or an assessment of the 
reasonableness of the Firm’s estimates and 
assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of 
the various instruments held by the Firm and the 
relative distribution of instruments within the range of 
characteristics. For example, two option contracts may 
have similar levels of market risk exposure and 
valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly 
different implied volatility levels because the option 
contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike 
prices. The input range and weighted and arithmetic 
average values will therefore vary from period-toperiod and parameter-to-parameter based on the 
characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at 
each balance sheet date.

Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs 
The following discussion provides a description of the 
impact on a fair value measurement of a change in each 
unobservable input in isolation, and the 
interrelationship between unobservable inputs, where 
relevant and significant. The impact of changes in 
inputs may not be independent, as a change in one 
unobservable input may give rise to a change in another 
unobservable input. Where relationships do exist 
between two unobservable inputs, those relationships 
are discussed below. Relationships may also exist 
between observable and unobservable inputs (for 
example, as observable interest rates rise, 
unobservable prepayment rates decline); such 
relationships have not been included in the discussion 
below. In addition, for each of the individual 
relationships described below, the inverse relationship 
would also generally apply. 
The following discussion also provides a description of 
attributes of the underlying instruments and external 
market factors that affect the range of inputs used in 
the valuation of the Firm’s positions. 
Yield – The yield of an asset is the interest rate used to 
discount future cash flows in a discounted cash flow 
calculation. An increase in the yield, in isolation, would 
result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. 
Credit spread – The credit spread is the amount of 
additional annualized return over the market interest 
rate that a market participant would demand for taking 
exposure to the credit risk of an instrument. The credit 
spread for an instrument forms part of the discount rate 
used in a discounted cash flow calculation. Generally, 
an increase in the credit spread would result in a 
decrease in a fair value measurement. 
The yield and the credit spread of a particular 
mortgage-backed security primarily reflect the risk 
inherent in the instrument. The yield is also impacted by 
the absolute level of the coupon paid by the instrument 
(which may not correspond directly to the level of 
inherent risk). Therefore, the range of yield and credit 
spreads reflects the range of risk inherent in various 
instruments owned by the Firm. The risk inherent in 
mortgage-backed securities is driven by the 
subordination of the security being valued and the 
characteristics of the underlying mortgages within the 
collateralized pool, including borrower FICO scores, 
LTV ratios for residential mortgages and the nature of 
the property and/or any tenants for commercial 
mortgages. For corporate debt securities, obligations of 
U.S. states and municipalities and other similar 
instruments, credit spreads reflect the credit quality of 
the obligor and the tenor of the obligation. 
Prepayment speed – The prepayment speed is a 
measure of the voluntary unscheduled principal 
repayments of a prepayable obligation in a 
collateralized pool. Prepayment speeds generally 
decline as borrower delinquencies rise. An increase in 
prepayment speeds, in isolation, would result in a 
decrease in a fair value measurement of assets valued 
at a premium to par and an increase in a fair value 
measurement of assets valued at a discount to par. 
Prepayment speeds may vary from collateral pool to 
collateral pool, and are driven by the type and location 
of the underlying borrower, and the remaining tenor of 
the obligation as well as the level and type (e.g., fixed or 
floating) of interest rate being paid by the borrower. 
Typically collateral pools with higher borrower credit 
quality have a higher prepayment rate than those with 
lower borrower credit quality, all other factors being 
equal. 
Conditional default rate – The conditional default rate is 
a measure of the reduction in the outstanding collateral 
balance underlying a collateralized obligation as a 
result of defaults. While there is typically no direct 
relationship between conditional default rates and 
prepayment speeds, collateralized obligations for which 
the underlying collateral has high prepayment speeds 
will tend to have lower conditional default rates. An 
increase in conditional default rates would generally be 
accompanied by an increase in loss severity and an 
increase in credit spreads. An increase in the 
conditional default rate, in isolation, would result in a 
decrease in a fair value measurement. Conditional 
default rates reflect the quality of the collateral 
underlying a securitization and the structure of the 
securitization itself. Based on the types of securities 
owned in the Firm’s market-making portfolios, 
conditional default rates are most typically at the lower 
end of the range presented. 
Loss severity – The loss severity (the inverse concept is 
the recovery rate) is the expected amount of future 
realized losses resulting from the ultimate liquidation of 
a particular loan, expressed as the net amount of loss 
relative to the outstanding loan balance. An increase in 
loss severity is generally accompanied by an increase in 
conditional default rates. An increase in the loss 
severity, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair 
value measurement. 
The loss severity applied in valuing a mortgage-backed 
security depends on factors relating to the underlying 
mortgages, including the LTV ratio, the nature of the 
lender’s lien on the property and other instrumentspecific factors.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

Correlation – Correlation is a measure of the 
relationship between the movements of two variables. 
Correlation is a pricing input for a derivative product 
where the payoff is driven by one or more underlying 
risks. Correlation inputs are related to the type of 
derivative (e.g., interest rate, credit, equity, foreign 
exchange and commodity) due to the nature of the 
underlying risks. When parameters are positively 
correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in an 
increase in the other parameter. When parameters are 
negatively correlated, an increase in one parameter will 
result in a decrease in the other parameter. An increase 
in correlation can result in an increase or a decrease in a 
fair value measurement. Given a short correlation 
position, an increase in correlation, in isolation, would 
generally result in a decrease in a fair value 
measurement.
The level of correlation used in the valuation of 
derivatives with multiple underlying risks depends on a 
number of factors including the nature of those risks. 
For example, the correlation between two credit risk 
exposures would be different than that between two 
interest rate risk exposures. Similarly, the tenor of the 
transaction may also impact the correlation input, as 
the relationship between the underlying risks may be 
different over different time periods. Furthermore, 
correlation levels are dependent on market conditions 
and could have a relatively wide range of levels within or 
across asset classes over time, particularly in volatile 
market conditions. 
Volatility – Volatility is a measure of the variability in 
possible returns for an instrument, parameter or market 
index given how much the particular instrument, 
parameter or index changes in value over time. 
Volatility is a pricing input for options, including equity 
options, commodity options, and interest rate options. 
Given a long position in an option, an increase in 
volatility, in isolation, would generally result in an 
increase in a fair value measurement. 
The level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular 
option-based derivative depends on a number of 
factors, including the nature of the risk underlying the 
option (e.g., the volatility of a particular equity security 
may be significantly different from that of a particular 
commodity index), the tenor of the derivative as well as 
the strike price of the option. 
Bermudan switch value – The switch value is the 
difference between the overall value of a Bermudan 
swaption, which can be exercised at multiple points in 
time, and its most expensive European swaption and 
reflects the additional value that the multiple exercise 
dates provide the holder. Switch values are dependent 
on market conditions and can vary greatly depending 
on a number of factors, such as the tenor of the 
underlying swap as well as the strike price of the option. 
An increase in switch value, in isolation, would generally 
result in an increase in a fair value measurement.
Interest rate curve – The interest rate curve represents 
the relationship of interest rates over differing tenors. 
The interest rate curve is used to set interest rate and 
foreign exchange derivative cash flows and is also a 
pricing input used in the discounting of any derivative 
cash flow. 
Forward price – The forward price is the price at which 
the buyer agrees to purchase the asset underlying a 
forward contract on the predetermined future delivery 
date, and is such that the value of the contract is zero at 
inception. 
The forward price is used as an input in the valuation of 
certain derivatives and depends on a number of factors 
including interest rates, the current price of the 
underlying asset, and the expected income to be 
received and costs to be incurred by the seller as a 
result of holding that asset until the delivery date. An 
increase in the forward can result in an increase or a 
decrease in a fair value measurement. 
Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements 
The following tables include a rollforward of the 
Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including 
changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified 
by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for 
the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. 
When a determination is made to classify a financial 
instrument within level 3, the determination is based on 
the significance of the unobservable inputs to the 
overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 
financial instruments typically include, in addition to the 
unobservable or level 3 components, observable 
components (that is, components that are actively 
quoted and can be validated to external sources); 
accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below 
include changes in fair value due in part to observable 
factors that are part of the valuation methodology. The 
Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 
3 financial instruments using securities and derivative 
positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair 
value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk 
management instruments are not included below, the 
gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the 
effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related 
to such level 3 instruments.

(a) Level 3 assets at fair value as a percentage of total Firm assets at fair value (including assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis) 
were 2% at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. Level 3 liabilities at fair value as a percentage of total Firm liabilities at fair value (including 
liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis) were 9% at December 31, 2024, and 8% at both December 31, 2023 and 2022.
(b) All level 3 derivatives are presented on a net basis, irrespective of the underlying counterparty.
(c) Primarily reported in principal transactions revenue, except for changes in fair value for CCB mortgage loans and lending-related commitments 
originated with the intent to sell, and mortgage loan purchase commitments, which are reported in mortgage fees and related income.
(d) Realized gains/(losses) on AFS securities are reported in investment securities gains/(losses). Unrealized gains/(losses) are reported in OCI. 
Realized and unrealized gains/(losses) recorded on level 3 AFS securities were not material for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 
2022.

Level 3 analysis
Consolidated balance sheets changes 
The following describes significant changes to level 3 
assets since December 31, 2023, for those items 
measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Refer to 
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a 
nonrecurring basis on page 199 for further information 
on changes impacting items measured at fair value on a 
nonrecurring basis. 
For the year ended December 31, 2024
Level 3 assets were $23.8 billion at December 31, 2024, 
reflecting an increase of $127 million from December 31, 
2023.
The increase for the year ended December 31, 2024 was 
driven by:
• $599 million increase in MSRs.
• $586 million increase in other assets primarily due to 
purchases,
offset by:
• $472 million decrease in gross derivative receivables 
due to sales and settlements predominantly offset by 
gains, purchases and net transfers.
• $663 million decrease in non-trading loans due to 
sales and settlements largely offset by gains, 
purchases and net transfers.

Credit and funding adjustments – derivatives
Derivatives are generally valued using models that use 
as their basis observable market parameters. These 
market parameters generally do not consider factors 
such as counterparty nonperformance risk, the Firm’s 
own credit quality, and funding costs. Therefore, it is 
generally necessary to make adjustments to the base 
estimate of fair value to reflect these factors.
CVA represents the adjustment, relative to the 
relevant benchmark interest rate, necessary to reflect 
counterparty nonperformance risk. The Firm 
estimates CVA using a scenario analysis to estimate 
the expected positive credit exposure across all of the 
Firm’s existing positions with each counterparty, and 
then estimates losses based on the probability of 
default and estimated recovery rate as a result of a 
counterparty credit event considering contractual 
factors designed to mitigate the Firm’s credit 
exposure, such as collateral and legal rights of offset. 
The key inputs to this methodology are (i) the 
probability of a default event occurring for each 
counterparty, as derived from observed or estimated 
CDS spreads; and (ii) estimated recovery rates implied 
by CDS spreads, adjusted to consider the differences 
in recovery rates as a derivative creditor relative to 
those reflected in CDS spreads, which generally reflect 
senior unsecured creditor risk.
FVA represents the adjustment to reflect the impact of 
funding and is recognized where there is evidence that 
a market participant in the principal market would 
incorporate it in a transfer of the instrument. The 
Firm’s FVA framework, applied to uncollateralized 
(including partially collateralized) over-the-counter 
(“OTC”) derivatives incorporates key inputs such as: (i) 
the expected funding requirements arising from the 
Firm’s positions with each counterparty and collateral 
arrangements; and (ii) the estimated market funding 
cost in the principal market which, for derivative 
liabilities, considers the Firm’s credit risk (DVA). For 
collateralized derivatives, the fair value is estimated by 
discounting expected future cash flows at the relevant 
overnight indexed swap rate given the underlying 
collateral agreement with the counterparty, and 
therefore a separate FVA is not necessary.
The following table provides the impact of credit and 
funding adjustments on principal transactions revenue 
in the respective periods, excluding the effect of any 
associated hedging activities. The FVA presented 
below includes the impact of the Firm’s own credit 
quality on the inception value of liabilities as well as the 
impact of changes in the Firm’s own credit quality over 
time.

Valuation adjustments on fair value option elected 
liabilities
The valuation of the Firm’s liabilities for which the fair 
value option has been elected requires consideration 
of the Firm’s own credit risk. DVA on fair value option 
elected liabilities reflects changes (subsequent to the 
issuance of the liability) in the Firm’s probability of 
default and LGD, which are estimated based on 
changes in the Firm’s credit spread observed in the 
bond market. Realized (gains)/losses due to DVA for 
fair value option elected liabilities are reported in 
principal transactions revenue. Unrealized (gains)/
losses are reported in OCI. Refer to page 196 in this 
Note and Note 24 for further information.

Equity securities without readily determinable fair values 
The Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), 
plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (i.e., 
measurement alternative), with such changes recognized in other income. 
In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if 
deemed necessary to arrive at the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to 
reflect the different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the 
Firm’s valuation techniques for private equity direct investments. 
The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held as 
of December 31, 2024 and 2023, that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments 
recorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are 
included in the nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.

Included in other assets above is the Firm’s interest in approximately 18.6 million Visa Class B-2 common shares 
("Visa B-2 shares") and 37.2 million Visa Class B common shares (“Visa B shares”) reflected in the Firm's principal 
investment portfolio as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
The Visa B shares were redenominated to Visa Class B-1 common shares (“Visa B-1 shares”) on January 24, 2024. 
On April 8, 2024, Visa commenced an initial exchange offer for any and all outstanding Visa B-1 shares. On May 6, 
2024, the Firm announced that Visa had accepted the Firm’s tender of its 37.2 million Visa B-1 shares in exchange 
for a combination of Visa B-2 shares and Visa Class C common shares (“Visa C shares”), resulting in an initial gain of 
$8.0 billion based on the fair value of the Visa C shares. In addition, the second quarter of 2024 also reflected other 
Visa-related activity, including the fair value changes of the Visa C shares and derivative instruments, as well as 
dividends, resulting in the $7.9 billion net gain on Visa shares in the quarter. As of September 30, 2024, the Firm had 
disposed of all of its Visa C shares through sales in the second and third quarters of 2024 and through a $1.0 billion 
contribution to the Firm’s Foundation in the second quarter of 2024. 
The Visa B-2 shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and are convertible into Visa Class A common shares 
(“Visa A shares”) at a specified conversion rate upon final resolution of certain litigation matters involving Visa. The 
conversion rate of Visa B-2 shares to Visa A shares was 1.5430 at December 31, 2024 and may be adjusted by Visa 
depending on developments related to the litigation matters. The outcome of those litigation matters, and the effect 
that the resolution of those matters may have on the conversion rate, is unknown. Accordingly, as of December 31, 
2024, there is significant uncertainty regarding when the transfer restrictions on Visa B-2 shares may be terminated 
and what the final conversion rate for the Visa B-2 shares will be. As a result of these considerations, as well as 
differences in voting rights, Visa B-2 shares are not considered to be similar to Visa A shares, and are held at their 
nominal carryover basis. 
Separately, in connection with sales of Visa B shares prior to 2024, the Firm has entered into derivative instruments 
with the purchasers of the shares under which the Firm retains the risk associated with changes in the conversion 
rate. Under the terms of the derivative instruments, the Firm will (a) make or receive payments based on subsequent 
changes in the conversion rate and (b) make periodic interest payments to the purchasers of the Visa B shares. The 
payments under the derivative instruments will continue as long as the Visa B-2 shares associated with the 
previously sold Visa B shares remain subject to transfer restrictions. The derivative instruments are accounted for at 
fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology based upon the Firm’s estimate of the timing and magnitude of 
final resolution of the litigation matters. The derivative instruments are recorded in trading liabilities, and changes in 
fair value are recognized in other income. The notional amount of shares associated with those derivative 
instruments has been adjusted as a result of the Visa exchange offer. As of December 31, 2024, the Firm held 
derivative instruments associated with 11.6 million Visa B-2 shares related to Visa B share sales prior to 2024, which 
are all subject to similar terms and conditions.

Additional disclosures about the fair value of 
financial instruments that are not carried on the 
Consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair 
value of certain financial instruments, which are 
included in the following table. However, this table 
does not include other items, such as nonfinancial 
assets, intangible assets, certain financial instruments, 
and customer relationships. In the opinion of 
management, these items, in the aggregate, add 
significant value to JPMorganChase.
Financial instruments for which carrying value 
approximates fair value 
Certain financial instruments that are not carried at fair 
value on the Consolidated balance sheets are carried 
at amounts that approximate fair value, due to their 
short-term nature and generally negligible credit risk. 
These instruments include cash and due from banks, 
deposits with banks, federal funds sold, securities 
purchased under resale agreements and securities 
borrowed, short-term receivables and accrued interest 
receivable, short-term borrowings, federal funds 
purchased, securities loaned and sold under 
repurchase agreements, accounts payable, and 
accrued liabilities. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires that 
the fair value of deposit liabilities with no stated 
maturity (i.e., demand, savings and certain money 
market deposits) be equal to their carrying value; 
recognition of the inherent funding value of these 
instruments is not permitted. 
The following table presents, by fair value hierarchy classification, the carrying values and estimated fair values at 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, of financial assets and liabilities, excluding financial instruments that are carried at 
fair value on a recurring basis, and their classification within the fair value hierarchy.

(a) Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of the underlying loans (including 
principal, contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, 
prepayment rates, and primary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of 
the underlying collateral. Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s 
expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is 
generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect 
the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value.

Note 3 – Fair value option
The fair value option provides an option to elect fair 
value for selected financial assets, financial liabilities, 
unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan 
commitments.
The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments 
at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate 
income statement volatility caused by the differences 
between the measurement basis of elected 
instruments (e.g., certain instruments that otherwise 
would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the 
associated risk management arrangements that are 
accounted for on a fair value basis, as well as to better 
reflect those instruments that are managed on a fair 
value basis. 
The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following 
instruments: 
• Loans purchased or originated as part of 
securitization warehousing activity, subject to 
bifurcation accounting, or managed on a fair value 
basis, including lending-related commitments
• Certain securities financing agreements
• Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial 
assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, 
which would otherwise be required to be separately 
accounted for as a derivative instrument 
• Structured notes and other hybrid instruments, 
which are predominantly financial instruments that 
contain embedded derivatives, that are issued or 
transacted as part of client-driven activities 
• Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by 
CIB’s consolidated securitization trusts where the 
underlying assets are carried at fair value

Determination of instrument-specific credit risk for 
items for which the fair value option was elected 
The following describes how the gains and losses that 
are attributable to changes in instrument-specific 
credit risk, were determined. 
• Loans and lending-related commitments: For 
floating-rate instruments, all changes in value are 
attributed to instrument-specific credit risk. For 
fixed-rate instruments, an allocation of the changes 
in value for the period is made between those 
changes in value that are interest rate-related and 
changes in value that are credit-related. Allocations 
are generally based on an analysis of borrowerspecific credit spread and recovery information, 
where available, or benchmarking to similar entities 
or industries. 
• Long-term debt: Changes in value attributable to 
instrument-specific credit risk were derived 
principally from observable changes in the Firm’s 
credit spread as observed in the bond market. 
• Securities financing agreements: Generally, for these 
types of agreements, there is a requirement that 
collateral be maintained with a market value equal to 
or in excess of the principal amount loaned; as a 
result, there would be no adjustment or an 
immaterial adjustment for instrument-specific credit 
risk related to these agreements. 
Difference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding 
The following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining 
contractual principal balance outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, for loans, long-term debt and longterm beneficial interests for which the fair value option has been elected.

(b) There were no performing loans that were ninety days or more past due as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
(c) Includes loans insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies less than 90 days past due.
(d) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests. Unlike 
principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal 
at maturity, nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of 
principal at maturity, but for structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature 
embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principalprotected notes.
(e) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity 
or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date.
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair value 
option was elected was $12.2 billion and $9.7 billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $50 million and 
$97 million, respectively. Refer to Note 28 for further information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related 
financial instruments.

Note 4 – Credit risk concentrations
Concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of 
clients, counterparties or customers are engaged in 
similar business activities or activities in the same 
geographic region, or when they have similar 
economic features that would cause their ability to 
meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected 
by changes in economic conditions.
JPMorganChase regularly monitors various segments 
of its credit portfolios to assess potential credit risk 
concentrations and to obtain additional collateral 
when deemed necessary and permitted under the 
Firm’s agreements. Senior management is significantly 
involved in the credit approval and review process, and 
risk levels are adjusted as needed to reflect the Firm’s 
risk appetite.
In the Firm’s consumer portfolio, concentrations are 
managed primarily by product and by U.S. geographic 
region, with a key focus on trends and concentrations 
at the portfolio level, where potential credit risk 
concentrations can be remedied through changes in 
underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. Refer to 
Note 12 for additional information on the geographic 
composition of the Firm’s consumer loan portfolios. In 
the wholesale portfolio, credit risk concentrations are 
evaluated primarily by industry and monitored 
regularly on both an aggregate portfolio level and on 
an individual client or counterparty basis. 
The Firm’s wholesale exposure is managed through 
loan syndications and participations, loan sales, 
securitizations, credit derivatives, master netting 
agreements, collateral and other risk-reduction 
techniques. Refer to Note 12 for additional information 
on loans. 
The Firm does not believe that its exposure to any 
particular loan product or industry segment results in 
a significant concentration of credit risk. 
Terms of loan products and collateral coverage are 
included in the Firm’s assessment when extending 
credit and establishing its allowance for credit losses. 
Refer to Note 13 for additional information on the 
allowance for credit losses.

Note 5 – Derivative instruments 
Derivative contracts derive their value from underlying 
asset prices, indices, reference rates, other inputs or a 
combination of these factors and may expose 
counterparties to risks and rewards of an underlying 
asset or liability without having to initially invest in, own 
or exchange the asset or liability. JPMorganChase 
makes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses 
derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. 
Predominantly all of the Firm’s derivatives are entered 
into for market-making or risk management purposes. 
Market-making derivatives 
The majority of the Firm’s derivatives are entered into 
for market-making purposes. Clients use derivatives to 
mitigate or modify interest rate, credit, foreign 
exchange, equity and commodity risks. The Firm 
actively manages the risks from its exposure to these 
derivatives by entering into other derivative contracts 
or by purchasing or selling other financial instruments 
that partially or fully offset the exposure from client 
derivatives. 
Risk management derivatives 
The Firm manages certain market and credit risk 
exposures using derivative instruments, including 
derivatives in hedge accounting relationships and other 
derivatives that are used to manage risks associated 
with specified assets and liabilities. 
The Firm generally uses interest rate derivatives to 
manage the risk associated with changes in interest 
rates. Fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or 
depreciate in market value as interest rates change. 
Similarly, interest income and expense increase or 
decrease as a result of variable-rate assets and 
liabilities resetting to current market rates, and as a 
result of the repayment and subsequent origination or 
issuance of fixed-rate assets and liabilities at current 
market rates. Gains and losses on the derivative 
instruments related to these assets and liabilities are 
expected to substantially offset this variability. 
Foreign currency derivatives are used to manage the 
foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign 
currency–denominated (i.e., non-U.S. dollar) assets and 
liabilities and forecasted transactions, as well as the 
Firm’s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries 
or branches whose functional currencies are not the 
U.S. dollar. As a result of fluctuations in foreign 
currencies, the U.S. dollar–equivalent values of the 
foreign currency–denominated assets and liabilities or 
the forecasted revenues or expenses increase or 
decrease. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments 
related to these foreign currency–denominated assets 
or liabilities, or forecasted transactions, are expected to 
substantially offset this variability. 
Commodities derivatives are used to manage the price 
risk of certain commodities inventories. Gains or losses 
on these derivative instruments are expected to 
substantially offset the depreciation or appreciation of 
the related inventory. 
Credit derivatives are used to manage the counterparty 
credit risk associated with loans and lending-related 
commitments. Credit derivatives compensate the 
purchaser when the entity referenced in the contract 
experiences a credit event, such as bankruptcy or a 
failure to pay an obligation when due. Credit derivatives 
primarily consist of CDS. Refer to the Credit derivatives 
section on pages 222–224 of this Note for a further 
discussion of credit derivatives. 
Refer to the risk management derivatives gains and 
losses table on page 221 and the hedge accounting 
gains and losses tables on pages 218–221 of this Note 
for more information about risk management 
derivatives. 
Derivative counterparties and settlement types 
The Firm enters into OTC derivatives, which are 
negotiated and settled bilaterally with the derivative 
counterparty. The Firm also enters into, as principal, 
certain ETD such as futures and options, and OTCcleared derivative contracts with CCPs. ETD contracts 
are generally standardized contracts traded on an 
exchange and cleared by the CCP, which is the Firm’s 
counterparty from the inception of the transactions. 
OTC-cleared derivatives are traded on a bilateral basis 
and then novated to the CCP for clearing. 
Derivative clearing services 
The Firm provides clearing services for clients in which 
the Firm acts as a clearing member at certain 
exchanges and clearing houses. The Firm does not 
reflect the clients’ derivative contracts in its 
Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 28 for 
further information on the Firm’s clearing services. 
Accounting for derivatives 
All free-standing derivatives that the Firm executes for 
its own account are required to be recorded on the 
Consolidated balance sheets at fair value. 
As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm nets derivative 
assets and liabilities, and the related cash collateral 
receivables and payables, when a legally enforceable 
master netting agreement exists between the Firm and 
the derivative counterparty. Refer to Note 1 for further 
discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities. The 
accounting for changes in value of a derivative depends 
on whether or not the transaction has been designated 
and qualifies for hedge accounting. Derivatives that are 
not designated as hedges are reported and measured 
at fair value through earnings. The tabular disclosures 
on pages 213–221 of this Note provide additional 
information on the amount of, and reporting for, 
derivative assets, liabilities, gains and losses. Refer to 
Notes 2 and 3 for a further discussion of derivatives 
embedded in structured notes. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

Derivatives designated as hedges 
The Firm applies hedge accounting to certain 
derivatives executed for risk management purposes – 
generally interest rate, foreign exchange and 
commodity derivatives. However, JPMorganChase 
does not seek to apply hedge accounting to all of the 
derivatives associated with the Firm’s risk 
management activities. For example, the Firm does 
not apply hedge accounting to purchased CDS used to 
manage the credit risk of loans and lending-related 
commitments, because of the difficulties in qualifying 
such contracts as hedges. For the same reason, the 
Firm does not apply hedge accounting to certain 
interest rate, foreign exchange, and commodity 
derivatives used for risk management purposes. 
To qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be 
highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the 
exposure being hedged. In addition, for a derivative to 
be designated as a hedge, the risk management 
objective and strategy must be documented. Hedge 
documentation must identify the derivative hedging 
instrument, the asset or liability or forecasted 
transaction and type of risk to be hedged, and how the 
effectiveness of the derivative is assessed 
prospectively and retrospectively. To assess 
effectiveness, the Firm uses statistical methods such 
as regression analysis, nonstatistical methods such as 
dollar-value comparisons of the change in the fair 
value of the derivative to the change in the fair value or 
cash flows of the hedged item, and qualitative 
comparisons of critical terms and the evaluation of any 
changes in those terms. The extent to which a 
derivative has been, and is expected to continue to be, 
highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value 
or cash flows of the hedged item must be assessed 
and documented at least quarterly. If it is determined 
that a derivative is not highly effective at hedging the 
designated exposure, hedge accounting is 
discontinued. 
There are three types of hedge accounting 
designations: fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and 
net investment hedges. JPMorganChase uses fair 
value hedges primarily to hedge fixed-rate long-term 
debt, AFS securities and certain commodities 
inventories. For qualifying fair value hedges, the 
changes in the fair value of the derivative, and in the 
value of the hedged item for the risk being hedged, are 
recognized in earnings. Certain amounts excluded 
from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded in 
OCI and recognized in earnings over the life of the 
derivative. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then 
the adjustment to the hedged item continues to be 
reported as part of the basis of the hedged item and, 
for interest-bearing financial instruments, is amortized 
to earnings as a yield adjustment. Derivative amounts 
affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the 
classification of the hedged item – primarily net 
interest income and principal transactions revenue. 
The Firm employs the portfolio layer method to 
manage the interest rate risk of portfolios of fixed-rate 
assets. Throughout the life of the open hedge, basis 
adjustments are maintained at the portfolio level and 
are only allocated to individual assets under certain 
circumstances. These include instances where the 
portfolio amount falls below the hedged layer 
amounts, or in cases of voluntary de-designation.
JPMorganChase uses cash flow hedges primarily to 
hedge the exposure to variability in forecasted cash 
flows from floating-rate assets and liabilities and 
foreign currency–denominated revenue and expense. 
For qualifying cash flow hedges, changes in the fair 
value of the derivative are recorded in OCI and 
recognized in earnings as the hedged item affects 
earnings. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are 
recognized consistent with the classification of the 
hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue, net 
interest income and compensation expense. If the 
hedge relationship is terminated, then the change in 
value of the derivative recorded in AOCI is recognized 
in earnings when the cash flows that were hedged 
affect earnings. For hedge relationships that are 
discontinued because a forecasted transaction is 
expected to not occur according to the original hedge 
forecast, any related derivative values recorded in 
AOCI are immediately recognized in earnings. 
JPMorganChase uses net investment hedges to 
protect the value of the Firm’s net investments in 
certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose 
functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. For 
qualifying net investment hedges, changes in the fair 
value of the derivatives due to changes in spot foreign 
exchange rates are recorded in OCI as translation 
adjustments. Amounts excluded from the assessment 
of effectiveness are recorded directly in earnings.

Derivatives netting
The following tables present, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, gross and net derivative receivables and payables 
by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from the 
same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has obtained an 
appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been 
either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those 
derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables. 
In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables 
and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts 
mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net 
presentation: 
• collateral that consists of liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are 
shown separately as "Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets" in the tables, up to the fair value 
exposure amount. For the purpose of this disclosure, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the 
definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule; 
• the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty 
level, as of the date presented, which is excluded from the tables; and 
• collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion 
has not been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from the 
tables.

Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features
In addition to the specific market risks introduced by each derivative contract type, derivatives expose 
JPMorganChase to credit risk — the risk that derivative counterparties may fail to meet their payment obligations 
under the derivative contracts and the collateral, if any, held by the Firm proves to be of insufficient value to cover 
the payment obligation. It is the policy of JPMorganChase to actively pursue, where possible, the use of legally 
enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements to mitigate derivative counterparty credit risk 
inherent in derivative receivables.
While derivative receivables expose the Firm to credit risk, derivative payables expose the Firm to liquidity risk, as 
the derivative contracts typically require the Firm to post cash or securities collateral with counterparties as the fair 
value of the contracts moves in the counterparties’ favor or upon specified downgrades in the Firm’s and its 
subsidiaries’ respective credit ratings. Certain derivative contracts also provide for termination of the contract, 
generally upon a downgrade of either the Firm or the counterparty, at the fair value of the derivative contracts. The 
following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared 
derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings 
downgrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at December 31, 
2024 and 2023.

The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at December 31, 2024 and 
2023, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that 
may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be 
posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined rating threshold is breached. A downgrade by a single 
rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another 
major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional 
initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payment requirements. The liquidity 
impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies 
referred to in the derivative contract.

Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset
In certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the 
economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in 
contemplation of the initial transfer. The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing 
transactions as described in Note 11, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and 
a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative 
was outstanding was not material at December 31, 2024 and 2023.

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of the benchmark (e.g., Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”)) interest rate risk of fixed-rate long-term 
debt and AFS securities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income. 
(b) Includes the amortization of income/expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied to the hedged item. 
Excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged items.
(c) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. 
Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in foreign currency rates and the income statement impact 
of excluded components were recorded primarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income.
(d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
(net realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.
(e) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such 
as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-currency basis spreads. Excluded components may impact 
earnings either through amortization of the initial amount over the life of the derivative or through fair value changes recognized in the 
current period. 
(f) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization approach, predominantly 
cross-currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative.

(a) Excludes physical commodities with a carrying value of $6.2 billion and $5.6 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, to which the 
Firm applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus 
recognizing unrealized gains and losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to 
net income in future periods.
(b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments related to foreign currency 
hedges will not reverse through the income statement in future periods. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying amount excluded for 
AFS securities was $28.7 billion and $19.3 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying amount excluded for long-term 
debt was $518 million and zero, respectively.
(c) Carrying amount represents the amortized cost, net of allowance if applicable. At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amortized 
cost of the portfolio layer method closed portfolios was $72.8 billion and $83.9 billion, of which $41.2 billion and $68.0 billion was designated 
as hedged, respectively. The amount designated as hedged is the sum of the notional amounts of all outstanding layers in each portfolio, 
which includes both spot starting and forward starting layers. At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the cumulative amount of basis 
adjustments was $(1.7) billion and $(165) million, which is comprised of $(1.2) billion and $73 million for active hedging relationships, and 
$(566) million and $(238) million for discontinued hedging relationships, respectively. Refer to Note 10 for additional information.
(d) Positive (negative) amounts related to assets represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will reduce (increase) net interest 
income in future periods. Positive (negative) amounts related to liabilities represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will 
increase (reduce) net interest income in future periods.
(e) Represents basis adjustments existing on the balance sheet date associated with hedged items that have been de-designated from 
qualifying fair value hedging relationships.

The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the years ended 2024, 2023 and 
2022.
Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $(1.6) billion (after-tax) of net losses recorded in AOCI 
at December 31, 2024, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have 
been terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized 
in earnings is approximately seven years, corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash 
flows. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is 
approximately seven years. The Firm’s longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing 
activities.

Credit derivatives 
Credit derivatives are financial instruments whose 
value is derived from the credit risk associated with 
the debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) 
and which allow one party (the protection purchaser) 
to transfer that risk to another party (the protection 
seller). Credit derivatives expose the protection 
purchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection 
seller, as the protection seller is required to make 
payments under the contract when the reference 
entity experiences a credit event, such as a 
bankruptcy, a failure to pay its obligation or a 
restructuring. The seller of credit protection receives a 
premium for providing protection but has the risk that 
the underlying instrument referenced in the contract 
will be subject to a credit event. 
The Firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in 
the credit derivatives market and uses these 
derivatives for two primary purposes. First, in its 
capacity as a market-maker, the Firm actively 
manages a portfolio of credit derivatives by 
purchasing and selling credit protection, 
predominantly on corporate debt obligations, to meet 
the needs of customers. Second, as an end-user, the 
Firm uses credit derivatives to manage credit risk 
associated with lending exposures (loans and 
unfunded commitments) in its wholesale and 
consumer businesses and derivatives counterparty 
exposures in its wholesale businesses, and to manage 
the credit risk arising from certain financial 
instruments in the Firm’s market-making businesses. 
Following is a summary of various types of credit 
derivatives. 
Credit default swaps 
Credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a 
single reference entity (“single-name”), broad-based 
index or portfolio. The Firm purchases and sells 
protection on both single- name and index-reference 
obligations. Single-name CDS and index CDS 
contracts are either OTC or OTC-cleared derivative 
contracts. Single-name CDS are used to manage the 
default risk of a single reference entity, while index 
CDS contracts are used to manage the credit risk 
associated with the broader credit markets or credit 
market segments. Like the S&P 500 and other market 
indices, a CDS index consists of a portfolio of CDS 
across many reference entities. New series of CDS 
indices are periodically established with a new 
underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect 
changes in the credit markets. If one of the reference 
entities in the index experiences a credit event, then 
the reference entity that defaulted is removed from the 
index. CDS can also be referenced against specific 
portfolios of reference names or against customized 
exposure levels: for example, to provide protection 
against the first $1 million of realized credit losses in a 
$10 million portfolio of exposure. Such structures are 
commonly known as tranche CDS. 
For both single-name CDS contracts and index CDS 
contracts, upon the occurrence of a credit event, under 
the terms of a CDS contract neither party to the CDS 
contract has recourse to the reference entity. The 
protection purchaser has recourse to the protection 
seller for the difference between the face value of the 
CDS contract and the fair value of the reference 
obligation at settlement of the credit derivative 
contract, also known as the recovery value. The 
protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt 
instrument of the underlying reference entity in order 
to receive amounts due under the CDS contract when 
a credit event occurs. 
Credit-related notes 
A credit-related note is a funded derivative with a 
credit risk component where the issuer of the creditrelated note purchases from the note investor credit 
protection on a reference entity or an index. Under the 
contract, the investor pays the issuer the par value of 
the note at the inception of the transaction, and in 
return, the issuer makes periodic payments to the 
investor, based on the credit risk of the referenced 
entity. The issuer also repays the investor the par value 
of the note at maturity unless the reference entity (or 
one of the entities that makes up a reference index) 
experiences a specified credit event. If a credit event 
occurs, the issuer is not obligated to repay the par 
value of the note, but rather, the issuer pays the 
investor the difference between the par value of the 
note and the fair value of the defaulted reference 
obligation at the time of settlement. Neither party to 
the credit-related note has recourse to the defaulting 
reference entity.
The following tables present a summary of the notional 
amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes 
the Firm sold and purchased as of December 31, 2024 
and 2023. Upon a credit event, the Firm as a seller of 
protection would typically pay out a percentage of the 
full notional amount of net protection sold, as the 
amount actually required to be paid on the contracts 
takes into account the recovery value of the reference 
obligation at the time of settlement. The Firm manages 
the credit risk on contracts to sell protection by 
purchasing protection with identical or similar 
underlying reference entities. Other purchased 
protection referenced in the following tables includes 
credit derivatives bought on related, but not identical, 
reference positions (including indices, portfolio 
coverage and other reference points) as well as 
protection purchased by CIB through credit-related 
notes. Other purchased protection also includes credit 
protection against certain loans in the retained lending 
portfolio through the issuance of credit derivatives and 
credit-related notes. 
Notes to consolidated financial statements

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such 
derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit 
event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of 
which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.

Note 6 – Noninterest revenue and noninterest expense
Noninterest revenue
The Firm records noninterest revenue from certain 
contracts with customers in investment banking fees, 
deposit-related fees, asset management fees, 
commissions and other fees, and components of card 
income. The related contracts are often terminable on 
demand and the Firm has no remaining obligation to 
deliver future services. For arrangements with a fixed 
term, the Firm may commit to deliver services in the 
future. Revenue associated with these remaining 
performance obligations typically depends on the 
occurrence of future events or underlying asset values, 
and is not recognized until the outcome of those 
events or values are known.
Investment banking fees 
This revenue category includes debt and equity 
underwriting and advisory fees. As an underwriter, the 
Firm helps clients raise capital via public offering and 
private placement of various types of debt and equity 
instruments. Underwriting fees are primarily based on 
the issuance price and quantity of the underlying 
instruments, and are recognized as revenue typically 
upon execution of the client’s transaction. The Firm 
also manages and syndicates loan arrangements. 
Credit arrangement and syndication fees, included 
within debt underwriting fees, are recorded as revenue 
after satisfying certain retention, timing and yield 
criteria. 
The Firm also provides advisory services by assisting 
its clients with mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, 
restructuring and other complex transactions. 
Advisory fees are recognized as revenue typically 
upon execution of the client’s transaction.

Principal transactions 
Principal transactions revenue is driven by many 
factors, including: 
• the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between 
the price at which a market participant is willing and 
able to sell an instrument to the Firm and the price at 
which another market participant is willing and able 
to buy it from the Firm, and vice versa; and 
• realized and unrealized gains and losses on financial 
instruments and commodities transactions, 
including those accounted for under the fair value 
option, primarily used in client-driven marketmaking activities. 
– Realized gains and losses result from the sale of 
instruments, closing out or termination of 
transactions, or interim cash payments. 
– Unrealized gains and losses result from changes in 
valuation. 
In connection with its client-driven market-making 
activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity 
instruments, derivatives and commodities, including 
physical commodities inventories and financial 
instruments that reference commodities. 
Principal transactions revenue also includes realized 
and unrealized gains and losses related to: 
• derivatives designated in qualifying hedge 
accounting relationships, primarily fair value hedges 
of commodity and foreign exchange risk; 
• derivatives used for specific risk management 
purposes, primarily to mitigate credit, foreign 
exchange and interest rate risks.
Refer to Note 5 for further information on the income 
statement classification of gains and losses from 
derivatives activities. 
In the financial commodity markets, the Firm transacts 
in OTC derivatives (e.g., swaps, forwards, options) and 
ETD that reference a wide range of underlying 
commodities. In the physical commodity markets, the 
Firm primarily purchases and sells precious and base 
metals, natural gas, and may hold other commodities 
inventories under financing and other arrangements 
with clients. 
The following table presents all realized and unrealized 
gains and losses recorded in principal transactions 
revenue. This table excludes interest income and 
interest expense on trading assets and liabilities, 
which are an integral part of the overall performance of 
the Firm’s client-driven market-making activities in 
CIB and fund deployment activities in Treasury and 
CIO. Refer to Note 7 for further information on interest 
income and interest expense. 
Trading revenue is presented primarily by instrument 
type. The Firm’s client-driven market-making 
businesses generally utilize a variety of instrument 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

types in connection with their market-making and 
related risk-management activities; accordingly, the 
trading revenue presented in the table below is not 
representative of the total revenue of any individual 
LOB.

Lending- and deposit-related fees 
Lending-related fees include fees earned from loan 
commitments, standby letters of credit, financial 
guarantees, and other loan-servicing activities. 
Deposit-related fees include fees earned from 
performing cash management activities, and providing 
overdraft and other deposit account services. Depositrelated fees also include the impact of credits earned 
by clients that reduce such fees. Lending- and depositrelated fees are recognized over the period in which 
the related service is provided. Refer to Note 28 for 
further information on lending-related commitments.

2023 as the commitments were generally short term. Refer to 
Note 34 for additional information.
Lending- and deposit-related fees are earned by CCB, 
CIB and AWM. 
Asset management fees
Investment management fees include fees associated 
with assets the Firm manages on behalf of its clients, 
including investors in Firm-sponsored funds and 
owners of separately managed investment accounts. 
Management fees are typically based on the value of 
assets under management and are collected and 
recognized at the end of each period over which the 
management services are provided and the value of 
the managed assets is known. The Firm also receives 
performance-based management fees, which are 
earned based on exceeding certain benchmarks or 
other performance targets and are accrued and 
recognized when the probability of reversal is remote, 
typically at the end of the related billing period.
All other asset management fees include commissions 
earned on the sales or distribution of mutual funds to 
clients. These fees are recorded as revenue at the time 
the service is rendered or, in the case of certain 
distribution fees, based on the underlying fund’s asset 
value or investor redemption activity.

from brokerage and custody services, and other 
products.
Brokerage commissions represents commissions 
earned when the Firm acts as a broker, by facilitating 
its clients’ purchases and sales of securities and other 
financial instruments. Brokerage commissions are 
collected and recognized as revenue upon occurrence 
of the client transaction. The Firm reports certain costs 
paid to third-party clearing houses and exchanges net 
against commission revenue.
Administration fees predominantly include fees for 
custody, funds services, securities lending and 
securities clearance. These fees are recorded as 
revenue over the period in which the related service is 
provided.

Mortgage fees and related income
This revenue category reflects CCB’s Home Lending 
production and net mortgage servicing revenue. 
Production revenue includes fees and income 
recognized as earned on mortgage loans originated 
with the intent to sell, and the impact of risk 
management activities associated with the mortgage 
pipeline and warehouse loans. Production revenue 
also includes gains and losses on sales and lower of 
cost or fair value adjustments on mortgage loans heldfor-sale (excluding certain repurchased loans insured 
by U.S. government agencies), and changes in the fair 
value of financial instruments measured under the fair 
value option. Net mortgage servicing revenue includes 
operating revenue earned from servicing third-party 
mortgage loans, which is recognized over the period in 
which the service is provided; changes in the fair value 
of MSRs; the impact of risk management activities 
associated with MSRs; and gains and losses on 
securitization of excess mortgage servicing. Net 
mortgage servicing revenue also includes gains and 
losses on sales and lower of cost or fair value 
adjustments of certain repurchased loans insured by 
U.S. government agencies. 
Refer to Note 15 for further information on risk 
management activities and MSRs. 
Net interest income from mortgage loans is recorded 
in interest income. 
Card income
This revenue category includes interchange and other 
income from credit and debit card transactions; and 
fees earned from processing card transactions for 
merchants, both of which are recognized when 
purchases are made by a cardholder and presented 
net of certain transaction-related costs. Card income 
also includes account origination costs and annual 
fees, which are deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over a 12-month period.
Certain credit card products offer the cardholder the 
ability to earn points based on account activity, which 
the cardholder can choose to redeem for cash and 
non-cash rewards. The cost to the Firm related to 
these proprietary rewards programs varies based on 
multiple factors including the terms and conditions of 
the rewards programs, cardholder activity, cardholder 
reward redemption rates and cardholder reward 
selections. The Firm maintains a liability for its 
obligations under its rewards programs and reports 
the current-period cost as a reduction of card income. 
Credit card revenue sharing agreements 
The Firm has contractual agreements with numerous 
co-brand partners that grant the Firm exclusive rights 
to issue co-branded credit card products and market 
them to the customers of such partners. These 
partners endorse the co-brand credit card programs 
and provide their customer or member lists to the 
Firm. The partners may also conduct marketing 
activities and provide rewards redeemable under their 
own loyalty programs that the Firm will grant to cobrand credit cardholders based on account activity. 
The terms of these agreements generally range from 
five to ten years.
The Firm typically makes payments to the co-brand 
credit card partners based on the cost of partners’ 
marketing activities and loyalty program rewards 
provided to credit cardholders, new account 
originations and sales volumes. Payments to partners 
based on marketing efforts undertaken by the 
partners are expensed by the Firm as incurred and 
reported as marketing expense. Payments for partner 
loyalty program rewards are reported as a reduction of 
card income when incurred. Payments to partners 
based on new credit card account originations are 
accounted for as direct loan origination costs and are 
deferred and recognized as a reduction of card income 
on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period. 
Payments to partners based on sales volumes are 
reported as a reduction of card income when the 
related interchange income is earned.

Note 7 – Interest income and interest expense
Interest income and interest expense are recorded in 
the Consolidated statements of income and classified 
based on the nature of the underlying asset or liability.
Interest income and interest expense includes the 
current-period interest accruals for financial 
instruments measured at fair value, except for 
derivatives and certain financial instruments 
containing embedded derivatives; for those 
instruments, all changes in fair value including any 
interest elements, are primarily reported in principal 
transactions revenue. For financial instruments that 
are not measured at fair value, the related interest is 
included within interest income or interest expense, as 
applicable. Interest income and interest expense also 
includes the effect of derivatives that qualify for hedge 
accounting where applicable.
Interest income on loans and securities include the 
amortization and accretion of purchase premiums and 
discounts, as well as net deferred fees and costs on 
loans. These amounts are deferred in loans and 
investment securities, respectively, and recognized on 
a level-yield basis.
Refer to Notes 5, 10, 11, 12, and 20 for further 
information on accounting for interest income and 
interest expense related to hedge accounting, 
investment securities, securities financing activities 
(i.e., securities purchased or sold under resale or 
repurchase agreements; securities borrowed; and 
securities loaned), loans and long-term debt, 
respectively.

Note 8 – Pension and other postretirement 
employee benefit plans 
The Firm has various defined benefit pension plans and 
OPEB plans that provide benefits to its employees in the 
U.S. and certain non-U.S. locations. Substantially all the 
defined benefit pension plans are closed to new 
participants. The principal defined benefit pension plan 
in the U.S., which covered substantially all U.S. 
employees, was closed to new participants and frozen 
for existing participants on January 1, 2020, (and 
January 1, 2019 for new hires on or after December 2, 
2017). Interest credits continue to accrue to 
participants’ accounts based on their accumulated 
balances.
The Firm maintains funded and unfunded 
postretirement benefit plans that provide medical and 
life insurance for certain eligible employees and retirees 
as well as their dependents covered under these 
programs. None of these plans have a material impact 
on the Firm’s Consolidated Financial Statements. 
The Firm also provides a qualified defined contribution 
plan in the U.S. and maintains other similar 
arrangements in certain non-U.S. locations. The most 
significant of these plans is the JPMorgan Chase 401(k) 
Savings Plan (“the 401(k) Savings Plan”), which covers 
substantially all U.S. employees. Employees can 
contribute to the 401(k) Savings Plan on a pretax and/or 
Roth 401(k) after-tax basis. The Firm makes annual 
matching and pay credit contributions to the 401(k) 
Savings Plan on behalf of eligible participants. 
The following table presents the pretax benefit obligations, plan assets, the net funded status, and the amounts 
recorded in AOCI on the Consolidated balance sheets for the Firm’s significant defined benefit pension and OPEB 
plans.

The weighted-average discount rate used to value the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, was 
5.49% and 5.16%, respectively.
Gains and losses
Gains or losses resulting from changes in the benefit 
obligation and the fair value of plan assets are recorded 
in OCI. Amortization of net gains or losses are 
recognized as part of the net periodic benefit cost over 
subsequent periods, if, as of the beginning of the year, 
the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the 
projected benefit obligation or the fair value of the plan 
assets. Amortization is generally over the average 
expected remaining lifetime of plan participants, given 
the frozen status of most plans. For the year ended 
December 31, 2024, the net loss was attributable to 
lower than expected returns on plan assets, partially 
offset by projected benefit obligation net gains 
primarily related to changes in the discount rate. For the 
year ended December 31, 2023, the net gain was 
attributable to market-driven increases in the fair value 
of plan assets, partially offset by changes in the 
discount rate and interest crediting rate.
The following table presents the net periodic benefit costs reported in the Consolidated statements of income for the

benefit costs for the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.

 2.54 %
Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets

 3.68 %
Plan assumptions
The Firm’s expected long-term rate of return is a 
blended weighted average, by asset allocation of the 
projected long-term returns for the various asset 
classes, taking into consideration local market 
conditions and the specific allocation of plan assets. 
Returns on asset classes are developed using a 
forward-looking approach and are not strictly based 
on historical returns, with consideration given to 
current market conditions and the portfolio mix of 
each plan. 
The discount rates used in determining the benefit 
obligations are generally provided by the Firm’s 
actuaries, with the Firm’s principal defined benefit 
pension plan using a rate that was selected by 
reference to the yields on portfolios of bonds with 
maturity dates and coupons that closely match the 
plan’s projected annual cash flows. 
Investment strategy and asset allocation
The assets of the Firm’s defined benefit pension plans 
are held in various trusts and are invested in welldiversified portfolios of equity and fixed income 
securities, cash and cash equivalents, and alternative 
investments. The Firm regularly reviews the asset 
allocations and asset managers, as well as other 
factors that could impact the portfolios, which are 
rebalanced when deemed necessary. As of December 
31, 2024, the approved asset allocation ranges by 
asset class for the Firm’s principal defined benefit plan 
are 41-100% debt securities, 0-40% equity securities, 
0-1% real estate, and 0-8% alternatives.
Assets held by the Firm’s defined benefit pension and 
OPEB plans do not include securities issued by 
JPMorganChase or its affiliates, except through 
indirect exposures through investments in exchange 
traded funds, mutual funds and collective investment 
funds managed by third-parties. The defined benefit 
pension and OPEB plans hold investments that are 
sponsored or managed by affiliates of JPMorganChase 
in the amount of $1.8 billion as of both December 31, 
2024 and 2023. 
Fair value measurement of the plans’ assets and liabilities

Note 9 – Employee share-based incentives
Employee share-based awards
In 2024, 2023 and 2022, JPMorganChase granted 
long-term share-based awards to certain employees 
under its LTIP, as amended and restated effective May 
18, 2021, and subsequently amended effective May 21, 
2024. Under the terms of the LTIP, as of December 31, 
2024, 81 million shares of common stock were 
available for issuance through May 2028. The LTIP is 
the only active plan under which the Firm is currently 
granting share-based incentive awards. In the 
following discussion, the LTIP constitutes the Firm’s 
share-based incentive plans. 
RSUs are awarded at no cost to the recipient upon 
their grant. Generally, RSUs are granted annually and 
vest at a rate of 50% after two years and 50% after 
three years and are converted into shares of common 
stock as of the vesting date. In addition, RSUs typically 
include full-career eligibility provisions, which allow 
employees to continue to vest upon voluntary 
termination based on age and/or service-related 
requirements, subject to post-employment and other 
restrictions. All RSU awards are subject to forfeiture 
until vested and contain clawback provisions that may 
result in cancellation under certain specified 
circumstances. Predominantly all RSUs entitle the 
recipient to receive cash payments equivalent to any 
dividends paid on the underlying common stock 
during the period the RSUs are outstanding. 
Performance share units (“PSUs”) are granted 
annually, and approved by the Firm’s Board of 
Directors, to members of the Firm’s Operating 
Committee under the variable compensation program. 
PSUs are subject to the Firm’s achievement of 
specified performance criteria over a three-year 
period. The number of awards that vest can range from 
zero to 150% of the grant amount. In addition, 
dividends that accrue during the vesting period are 
reinvested in dividend equivalent share units. PSUs 
and the related dividend equivalent share units are 
converted into shares of common stock after vesting.
Once the PSUs and dividend equivalent share units 
have vested, the shares of common stock that are 
delivered, after applicable tax withholding, must be 
retained for an additional holding period, for a total 
combined vesting and holding period of approximately 
five to eight years from the grant date depending on 
regulations in certain countries. 
Under the LTI Plans, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) 
were granted with an exercise price equal to the fair 
value of JPMorganChase’s common stock on the grant 
date. SARs expire ten years after the grant date. There 
were no grants of SARs in 2024, 2023 or 2022. 
The Firm separately recognizes compensation 
expense for each tranche of each award, net of 
estimated forfeitures, as if it were a separate award 
with its own vesting date. Generally, for each tranche 
granted, compensation expense is recognized on a 
straight-line basis from the grant date until the vesting 
date of the respective tranche, provided that the 
employees will not become full-career eligible during 
the vesting period. For awards with full-career 
eligibility provisions and awards granted with no future 
substantive service requirement, the Firm accrues the 
estimated value of awards expected to be awarded to 
employees as of the grant date without giving 
consideration to the impact of post-employment 
restrictions. For each tranche granted to employees 
who will become full-career eligible during the vesting 
period, compensation expense is recognized on a 
straight-line basis from the grant date until the earlier 
of the employee’s full-career eligibility date or the 
vesting date of the respective tranche. 
The Firm’s policy for issuing shares upon settlement of 
employee share-based incentive awards is to issue 
either new shares of common stock or treasury shares. 
During 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Firm settled all of its 
employee share-based awards by issuing treasury 
shares. 
Refer to Note 23 for further information on the 
classification of share-based awards for purposes of 
calculating earnings per share.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

RSUs, PSUs and SARs activity 
Generally, compensation expense for RSUs and PSUs is measured based on the number of units granted multiplied 
by the stock price at the grant date, and for SARs, is measured at the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation 
model. Compensation expense for these awards is recognized in net income as described previously. The following 
table summarizes JPMorganChase’s RSUs, PSUs and SARs activity for 2024.

of SARs exercised during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, was $24 million and $75 million, 
respectively.
Compensation expense
The Firm recognized the following noncash

cost is expected to be amortized into compensation 
expense over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years. 
The Firm does not capitalize any compensation 
expense related to share-based compensation awards 
to employees. 
Tax benefits
Income tax benefits (including tax benefits from 
dividends or dividend equivalents) related to sharebased incentive arrangements recognized in the 
Firm’s Consolidated statements of income for the 
years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, were 
$1.0 billion, $836 million and $901 million, respectively.

Note 10 – Investment securities
Investment securities consist of debt securities that are 
classified as AFS or HTM. Debt securities classified as 
trading assets are discussed in Note 2. Predominantly 
all of the Firm’s AFS and HTM securities are held by 
Treasury and CIO in connection with its asset-liability 
management activities.
AFS securities are carried at fair value on the 
Consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains and 
losses, after any applicable hedge accounting 
adjustments or allowance for credit losses, are 
reported in AOCI. The specific identification method is 
used to determine realized gains and losses on AFS 
securities, which are included in investment securities 
gains/(losses) on the Consolidated statements of 
income. HTM securities, which the Firm has the intent 
and ability to hold until maturity, are carried at 
amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses, on 
the Consolidated balance sheets.
For both AFS and HTM securities, purchase discounts 
or premiums are generally amortized into interest 
income on a level-yield basis over the contractual life of 
the security. However, premiums on certain callable 
debt securities are amortized to the earliest call date.

(a) Represents the amount of portfolio layer method basis adjustments related to AFS securities hedged in a closed portfolio. Under U.S. GAAP 
portfolio layer method basis adjustments are not allocated to individual securities, however the amounts impact the unrealized gains or 
losses in the table for the types of securities being hedged. Refer to Note 1 and Note 5 for additional information.
(b) The Firm purchased $4.7 billion, $4.1 billion and $33.7 billion of HTM securities for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, 
respectively.
(c) Effective January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted the portfolio layer method hedge accounting guidance which permitted a transfer of HTM 
securities to AFS upon adoption. The Firm transferred obligations of U.S. states and municipalities with a carrying value of $7.1 billion 
resulting in the recognition of $38 million net pre-tax unrealized losses in AOCI. This transfer was a non-cash transaction. Refer to Note 24 for 
additional information.
(d) The amortized cost of investment securities is reported net of allowance for credit losses of $152 million, $128 million and $96 million at 
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
(e) Excludes $3.7 billion and $2.8 billion of accrued interest receivable at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, included in accrued interest 
and accounts receivable on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm generally does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on 
accrued interest receivable, consistent with its policy to write them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income. The Firm 
did not reverse through interest income any accrued interest receivable for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

At December 31, 2024, the investment securities 
portfolio consisted of debt securities with an average 
credit rating of AA+ (based upon external ratings 
where available, and where not available, based 
primarily upon internal risk ratings). Risk ratings are 
used to identify the credit quality of securities and 
differentiate risk within the portfolio. The Firm’s 
internal risk ratings generally align with the qualitative 
characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet 
financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in 
the economic environment) defined by S&P and 
Moody’s, however the quantitative characteristics 
(e.g., probability of default (“PD”) and loss given default 
(“LGD”)) may differ as they reflect internal historical 
experiences and assumptions. Risk ratings are 
assigned at acquisition, reviewed on a regular and 
ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and 
adjusted as necessary over the life of the investment 
for updated information affecting the issuer’s ability to 
fulfill its obligations.
AFS securities impairment 
The following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses by aging category for AFS securities at 
December 31, 2024 and 2023. The tables exclude U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and U.S. GSE 
and government agency MBS with unrealized losses of $5.3 billion and $4.6 billion, at December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
respectively; changes in the value of these securities are generally driven by changes in interest rates rather than 
changes in their credit profile given the explicit or implicit guarantees provided by the U.S. government.

AFS securities are considered impaired if the fair value 
is less than the amortized cost. 
The Firm recognizes impairment losses in earnings if 
the Firm has the intent to sell the debt security, or if it 
is more likely than not that the Firm will be required to 
sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized 
cost. In these circumstances the impairment loss is 
recognized in investment securities gains/(losses) in 
the Consolidated Statements of Income and is equal to 
the full difference between the amortized cost (net of 
allowance if applicable) and the fair value of the 
security. 
For impaired debt securities that the Firm has the 
intent and ability to hold, the securities are evaluated 
to determine if a credit loss exists. If it is determined 
that a credit loss exists, that loss is recognized as an 
allowance for credit losses through the provision for 
credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of 
Income, limited by the amount of impairment. Any 
impairment on debt securities that the Firm has the 
intent and ability to hold not due to credit losses is 
recorded in OCI. 
Factors considered in evaluating credit losses include 
adverse conditions specifically related to the industry, 
geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or 
underlying collateral of a security; and payment 
structure of the security. 
When assessing securities issued in a securitization 
for credit losses, the Firm estimates cash flows 
considering relevant market and economic data, 
underlying loan-level data, and structural features of 
the securitization, such as subordination, excess 
spread, overcollateralization or other forms of credit 
enhancement, and compares the losses projected for 
the underlying collateral (“pool losses”) against the 
level of credit enhancement in the securitization 
structure to determine whether these features are 
sufficient to absorb the pool losses, or whether a credit 
loss exists. 
For beneficial interests in securitizations that are rated 
below “AA” at their acquisition, or that can be 
contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in such a 
way that the Firm would not recover substantially all of 
its recorded investment, the Firm evaluates 
impairment for credit losses when there is an adverse 
change in expected cash flows. 
HTM securities – credit risk
Allowance for credit losses
The allowance for credit losses on HTM securities 
represents expected credit losses over the remaining 
expected life of the securities.
The allowance for credit losses on HTM obligations of 
U.S. states and municipalities and commercial 
mortgage-backed securities is calculated by applying 
statistical credit loss factors (estimated PD and LGD) 
to the amortized cost. The credit loss factors are 
derived using a weighted average of five internally 
developed eight-quarter macroeconomic scenarios, 
followed by a single year straight-line interpolation to 
revert to long run historical information for periods 
beyond the forecast period. Refer to Note 13 for further 
information on the eight-quarter macroeconomic 
forecast. 
The allowance for credit losses on HTM collateralized 
loan obligations and U.S. residential mortgage-backed 
securities is calculated as the difference between the 
amortized cost and the present value of the cash flows 
expected to be collected, discounted at the security’s 
effective interest rate. These cash flow estimates are 
developed based on expectations of underlying 
collateral performance derived using the eight-quarter 
macroeconomic forecast and the single year straightline interpolation, as well as considering the structural 
features of the security. 
The application of different inputs and assumptions 
into the calculation of the allowance for credit losses is 
subject to significant management judgment, and 
emphasizing one input or assumption over another, or 
considering other inputs or assumptions, could affect 
the estimate of the allowance for credit losses on HTM 
securities. 
Credit quality indicator
The primary credit quality indicator for HTM securities 
is the risk rating assigned to each security. At both 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, all HTM securities were 
rated investment grade and were current and 
accruing, with approximately 99% rated at least AA+ 
(based upon external ratings where available, and 
where not available, based primarily upon internal risk 
ratings).
Allowance for credit losses on investment securities
The allowance for credit losses on investment 
securities was $152 million, $128 million and 
$96 million as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, 
respectively, which included a cumulative-effect 
adjustment to retained earnings related to the transfer 
of HTM securities to AFS for the year ended 
December 31, 2023.

(a) Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted based on the amortized cost of 
each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of 
related hedging derivatives, including closed portfolio hedges. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield 
excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected 
maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call 
date.
(b) For purposes of this table, the amortized cost of available-for-sale securities excludes the allowance for credit losses of $49 million and the 
portfolio layer fair value hedge basis adjustments of $(1.2) billion at December 31, 2024. The amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities also 
excludes the allowance for credit losses of $103 million at December 31, 2024.
(c) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual 
maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately eight years for agency residential 
MBS, six years for agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations, and five years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage 
obligations.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

Note 11 – Securities financing activities
JPMorganChase enters into resale, repurchase, 
securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements 
(collectively, “securities financing agreements”) 
primarily to finance the Firm’s inventory positions, 
acquire securities to cover short sales, accommodate 
customers’ financing needs, settle other securities 
obligations and to deploy the Firm’s excess cash. 
Securities financing agreements are treated as 
collateralized financings on the Firm’s Consolidated 
balance sheets. Where appropriate under applicable 
accounting guidance, securities financing agreements 
with the same counterparty are reported on a net 
basis. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the 
offsetting of assets and liabilities. Fees received and 
paid in connection with securities financing 
agreements are recorded over the life of the 
agreement in interest income and interest expense on 
the Consolidated statements of income. 
The Firm has elected the fair value option for certain 
securities financing agreements. Refer to Note 3 for 
further information regarding the fair value option. The 
securities financing agreements for which the fair 
value option has been elected are reported within 
securities purchased under resale agreements, 
securities loaned or sold under repurchase 
agreements, and securities borrowed on the 
Consolidated balance sheets. Generally, for 
agreements carried at fair value, current-period 
interest accruals are recorded within interest income 
and interest expense, with changes in fair value 
reported in principal transactions revenue. However, 
for financial instruments containing embedded 
derivatives that would be separately accounted for in 
accordance with accounting guidance for hybrid 
instruments, all changes in fair value, including any 
interest elements, are reported in principal 
transactions revenue. 
Securities financing agreements not elected under the 
fair value option are measured at amortized cost. As a 
result of the Firm’s credit risk mitigation practices 
described below, the Firm did not hold any allowance 
for credit losses with respect to resale and securities 
borrowed arrangements as of December 31, 2024 and 
2023.
Credit risk mitigation practices
Securities financing agreements expose the Firm 
primarily to credit and liquidity risk. To manage these 
risks, the Firm monitors the value of the underlying 
securities (predominantly high-quality securities 
collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S. 
GSEs and government agencies MBS) that it has 
received from or provided to its counterparties 
compared to the value of cash proceeds and 
exchanged collateral, and either requests additional 
collateral or returns securities or collateral when 
appropriate. Margin levels are initially established 
based upon the counterparty, the type of underlying 
securities, and the permissible collateral, and are 
monitored on an ongoing basis. 
In resale and securities borrowed agreements, the 
Firm is exposed to credit risk to the extent that the 
value of the securities received is less than initial cash 
principal advanced and any collateral amounts 
exchanged. In repurchase and securities loaned 
agreements, credit risk exposure arises to the extent 
that the value of underlying securities advanced 
exceeds the value of the initial cash principal received, 
and any collateral amounts exchanged. 
Additionally, the Firm typically enters into master 
netting agreements and other similar arrangements 
with its counterparties, which provide for the right to 
liquidate the underlying securities and any collateral 
amounts exchanged in the event of a counterparty 
default. It is also the Firm’s policy to take possession, 
where possible, of the securities underlying resale and 
securities borrowed agreements. Refer to Note 29 for 
further information regarding assets pledged and 
collateral received in securities financing agreements.
Notes to consolidated financial statements

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

The table below summarizes the gross and net 
amounts of the Firm’s securities financing agreements, 
as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. When the Firm has 
obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a 
master netting agreement with a counterparty and 
where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP 
are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance 
sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities 
financing agreements with the same counterparty. In 
addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash 
collateral with its counterparty to reduce the economic 
exposure with the counterparty, but such collateral is 
not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet 
presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an 
appropriate legal opinion with respect to the 
counterparty master netting agreement, such 
collateral, along with securities financing balances that 
do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under 
U.S. GAAP, is presented in the table below as 
“Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance 
sheets,” and reduces the “Net amounts” presented. 
Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or 
obtained, the securities financing balances are 
presented gross in the “Net amounts” below. In 
transactions where the Firm is acting as the lender in a 
securities-for-securities lending agreement and 
receives securities that can be pledged or sold as 
collateral, the Firm recognizes the securities received 
at fair value within other assets and the obligation to 
return those securities within accounts payable and 
other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Note 12 – Loans
Loan accounting framework
The accounting for a loan depends on management’s 
strategy for the loan. The Firm accounts for loans 
based on the following categories:
• Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment 
(i.e., “retained”)
• Loans held-for-sale
• Loans at fair value
The following provides a detailed accounting 
discussion of the Firm’s loans by category:
Loans held-for-investment
Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment, 
including PCD, are recorded at amortized cost, 
reflecting the principal amount outstanding, net of the 
following: unamortized deferred loan fees, costs, 
premiums or discounts; charge-offs; collection of cash; 
and foreign exchange. Credit card loans also include 
billed finance charges and fees.
Interest income
Interest income on performing loans held-forinvestment is accrued and recognized as interest 
income at the contractual rate of interest. Purchase 
price discounts or premiums, as well as net deferred 
loan fees or costs, are recognized in interest income 
over the contractual life of the loan as an adjustment of 
yield.
The Firm classifies accrued interest on loans, including 
accrued but unbilled interest on credit card loans, in 
accrued interest and accounts receivables on the 
Consolidated balance sheets. For credit card loans, 
accrued interest once billed is then recognized in the 
loan balances, with the related allowance recorded in 
the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the 
allowance for credit losses on accrued interest on 
credit card loans are recognized in the provision for 
credit losses and charge-offs are recognized by 
reversing interest income. For other loans, the Firm 
generally does not recognize an allowance for credit 
losses on accrued interest receivables, consistent with 
its policy to write them off no later than 90 days past 
due by reversing interest income. 
Nonaccrual loans 
Nonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of 
interest has been suspended. Loans (other than credit 
card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. 
government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual 
status and considered nonperforming when full 
payment of principal and interest is not expected, 
regardless of delinquency status, or when principal 
and interest has been in default for a period of 90 days 
or more, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the 
process of collection. A loan is determined to be past 
due when the minimum payment is not received from 
the borrower by the contractually specified due date or 
for certain loans (e.g., residential real estate loans), 
when a monthly payment is due and unpaid for 30 
days or more. Finally, collateral-dependent loans are 
typically maintained on nonaccrual status. 
On the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all 
interest accrued but not collected is reversed against 
interest income. In addition, the amortization of 
deferred amounts is suspended. Interest income on 
nonaccrual loans may be recognized as cash interest 
payments are received (i.e., on a cash basis) if the 
recorded loan balance is deemed fully collectible; 
however, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate 
collectibility of the recorded loan balance, all interest 
cash receipts are applied to reduce the carrying value 
of the loan (the cost recovery method). For consumer 
loans, application of this policy typically results in the 
Firm recognizing interest income on nonaccrual 
consumer loans on a cash basis.
A loan may be returned to accrual status when 
repayment is reasonably assured and there has been 
demonstrated performance under the terms of the 
loan or, if applicable, the terms of the restructured 
loan. 
As permitted by regulatory guidance, credit card loans 
are generally exempt from being placed on nonaccrual 
status; accordingly, interest and fees related to credit 
card loans continue to accrue until the loan is charged 
off or paid in full. 
Allowance for loan losses 
The allowance for loan losses represents the 
estimated expected credit losses in the held-forinvestment loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
and is recognized on the balance sheet as a contra 
asset, which brings the amortized cost to the net 
carrying value. Changes in the allowance for loan 
losses resulting from lending-related activity, 
macroeconomic variables, changes in credit and other 
inputs are recorded in the provision for credit losses 
on the Firm’s Consolidated statements of income. 
Refer to Note 13 for further information on the Firm’s 
accounting policies for the allowance for loan losses. 
Charge-offs 
Consumer loans are generally charged off or charged 
down to the lower of the amortized cost or the net 
realizable value of the underlying collateral (i.e., fair 
value less estimated costs to sell), with an offset to the 
allowance for loan losses, upon reaching specified 
stages of delinquency in accordance with standards 
established by the FFIEC. Residential real estate loans, 
unmodified credit card loans and scored business 
banking loans are generally charged off no later than 
180 days past due. Scored auto and closed-end 
consumer loans, including modified credit card 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

accounts placed on a fixed payment plan, are charged 
off no later than 120 days past due. 
Certain consumer loans are charged off or charged 
down to their net realizable value earlier than the 
FFIEC charge-off standards in the following 
circumstances: 
• Loans modified to borrowers experiencing financial 
difficulty that are determined to be collateraldependent. 
• Loans to borrowers who have experienced an event 
that suggests a loss is either known or highly certain 
are subject to accelerated charge-off standards 
(e.g., residential real estate and auto loans are 
charged off or charged down within 60 days of 
receiving notification of a bankruptcy filing). 
• Auto loans upon repossession of the automobile. 
Other than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm 
typically does not recognize charge-offs on the 
government-guaranteed portion of loans. 
Wholesale loans are charged off when it is highly 
certain that a loss has been realized. The 
determination of whether to recognize a charge-off 
includes many factors, including the prioritization of 
the Firm’s claim in bankruptcy, expectations of the 
workout/restructuring of the loan and valuation of the 
borrower’s equity or the loan collateral. 
When a loan is charged down to the lower of its 
amortized cost or the estimated net realizable value of 
the underlying collateral, the determination of the fair 
value of the collateral depends on the type of collateral 
(e.g., securities, real estate). In cases where the 
collateral is in the form of liquid securities, the fair 
value is based on quoted market prices or broker 
quotes. For illiquid securities or other financial assets, 
the fair value of the collateral is generally estimated 
using a discounted cash flow model. 
For residential real estate loans, collateral values are 
based upon external valuation sources. When it 
becomes likely that a borrower is either unable or 
unwilling to pay, the Firm utilizes a broker’s price 
opinion, appraisal and/or an automated valuation 
model of the home based on an exterior-only valuation 
(“exterior opinions”), which is then updated at least 
every 12 months, or more frequently depending on 
various market factors. As soon as practicable after 
the Firm receives the property in satisfaction of a debt 
(e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession), the 
Firm generally obtains an appraisal based on an 
inspection that includes the interior of the home 
(“interior appraisals”). Exterior opinions and interior 
appraisals are discounted based upon the Firm’s 
experience with actual liquidation values as compared 
with the estimated values provided by exterior 
opinions and interior appraisals, considering statespecific factors. 
For commercial real estate loans, collateral values are 
generally based on appraisals from internal and 
external valuation sources. Collateral values are 
typically updated every six to twelve months, either by 
obtaining a new appraisal or by performing an internal 
analysis, in accordance with the Firm’s policies. The 
Firm also considers both borrower- and marketspecific factors, which may result in obtaining 
appraisal updates or broker price opinions at more 
frequent intervals.
Loans held-for-sale 
Loans held-for-sale are measured at the lower of cost 
or fair value, with valuation changes recorded in 
noninterest revenue. For consumer loans, the 
valuation is performed on a portfolio basis. For 
wholesale loans, the valuation is performed on an 
individual loan basis. 
Interest income on loans held-for-sale is accrued and 
recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. 
Loan origination fees or costs and purchase price 
discounts or premiums are deferred in a contra loan 
account until the related loan is sold. The deferred fees 
or costs and discounts or premiums are an adjustment 
to the basis of the loan and therefore are included in 
the periodic determination of the lower of cost or fair 
value adjustments and/or the gain or loss recognized 
at the time of sale. 
Because these loans are recognized at the lower of 
cost or fair value, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses 
and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. 
However, loans held-for-sale are subject to the Firm’s 
nonaccrual policies. 
Loans at fair value 
Loans for which the fair value option has been elected 
are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value 
recorded in noninterest revenue. 
Interest income on these loans is accrued and 
recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. 
Changes in fair value are recognized in noninterest 
revenue. Loan origination fees are recognized upfront 
in noninterest revenue. Loan origination costs are 
recognized in the associated expense category as 
incurred. 
Because these loans are recognized at fair value, the 
Firm’s allowance for loan losses and charge-off 
policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans at 
fair value are subject to the Firm’s nonaccrual policies. 
Refer to Note 3 for further information on the Firm’s 
elections of fair value accounting under the fair value 
option. Refer to Note 2 and Note 3 for further 
information on loans carried at fair value and classified 
as trading assets. 
Notes to consolidated financial statements

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

Loan classification changes 
Loans in the held-for-investment portfolio that 
management decides to sell are transferred to the 
held-for-sale portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value 
on the date of transfer. Credit-related losses are 
charged against the allowance for loan losses; noncredit related losses such as those due to changes in 
interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates are 
recognized in noninterest revenue. 
In the event that management decides to retain a loan 
in the held-for-sale portfolio, the loan is transferred to 
the held-for-investment portfolio at amortized cost on 
the date of transfer. These loans are subsequently 
assessed for impairment based on the Firm’s 
allowance methodology. Refer to Note 13 for a further 
discussion of the methodologies used in establishing 
the Firm’s allowance for loan losses. 
Loan modifications 
The Firm seeks to modify certain loans in conjunction 
with its loss mitigation activities. Through the 
modification, JPMorganChase grants one or more 
concessions to a borrower who is experiencing 
financial difficulty in order to minimize the Firm’s 
economic loss and avoid foreclosure or repossession 
of the collateral, and to ultimately maximize payments 
received by the Firm from the borrower. The 
concessions granted vary by program and by 
borrower-specific characteristics, and may include 
interest rate reductions, term extensions, other-thaninsignificant payment delays or principal forgiveness. 
Loans, except for credit card loans, reported as FDMs 
are generally placed on nonaccrual status, although in 
many cases such loans were already on nonaccrual 
status prior to modification. These loans may be 
returned to performing status (the accrual of interest is 
resumed) if the following criteria are met: (i) the 
borrower has performed under the modified terms for 
a minimum of six months and/or six payments, and (ii) 
the Firm has an expectation that repayment of the 
modified loan is reasonably assured based on, for 
example, the borrower’s debt capacity and level of 
future earnings, collateral values, LTV ratios, and other 
current market considerations. In certain limited and 
well-defined circumstances in which the loan is current 
at the modification date, such loans are not placed on 
nonaccrual status at the time of modification. 
The allowance for credit losses associated with FDMs 
is measured using the Firm’s established allowance 
methodology, which considers the expected default 
rates for the modified loans. Refer to Note 13 for 
further discussion. 
Foreclosed property 
The Firm acquires property from borrowers through 
loan restructurings, workouts, and foreclosures. 
Property acquired may include real property (e.g., 
residential real estate, land, and buildings) and other 
commercial and personal property (e.g., automobiles, 
aircraft, railcars, and ships). 
The Firm recognizes foreclosed property upon 
receiving assets in satisfaction of a loan (e.g., by taking 
legal title or physical possession). For loans 
collateralized by real property, the Firm generally 
recognizes the asset received at foreclosure sale or 
upon the execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure 
transaction with the borrower. Foreclosed assets are 
reported in other assets on the Consolidated balance 
sheets and initially recognized at fair value less 
estimated costs to sell. Each quarter the fair value of 
the acquired property is reviewed and adjusted, if 
necessary, to the lower of cost or fair value. 
Subsequent adjustments to fair value are charged/
credited to noninterest revenue. Operating expense, 
such as real estate taxes and maintenance, are 
charged to other expense. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

Loan portfolio 
The Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to 
determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each 
portfolio segment the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk 
characteristics of each loan class.

Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality 
indicator for consumer loans. Loans that are more than 
30 days past due provide an early warning of 
borrowers who may be experiencing financial 
difficulties and/or who may be unable or unwilling to 
repay the loan. As the loan continues to age, it 
becomes more clear whether the borrower is likely to 
be unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of residential 
real estate loans, late-stage delinquencies (greater 
than 150 days past due) are a strong indicator of loans 
that will ultimately result in a foreclosure or similar 
liquidation transaction. In addition to delinquency 
rates, other credit quality indicators for consumer 
loans vary based on the class of loan, as follows: 
• For residential real estate loans, the current 
estimated LTV ratio, or the combined LTV ratio in 
the case of junior lien loans, is an indicator of the 
potential loss severity in the event of default. 
Additionally, LTV or combined LTV ratios can 
provide insight into a borrower’s continued 
willingness to pay, as the delinquency rate of highLTV loans tends to be greater than that for loans 
where the borrower has equity in the collateral. The 
geographic distribution of the loan collateral also 
provides insight as to the credit quality of the 
portfolio, as factors such as the regional economy, 
home price changes and specific events such as 
natural disasters, will affect credit quality. The 
borrower’s current or “refreshed” FICO score is a 
secondary credit quality indicator for certain loans, 
as FICO scores are an indication of the borrower’s 
credit payment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower 
with a low FICO score (less than 660) is considered 
to be of higher risk than a loan to a borrower with a 
higher FICO score. Further, a loan to a borrower with 
a high LTV ratio and a low FICO score is at greater 
risk of default than a loan to a borrower that has both 
a high LTV ratio and a high FICO score.
• For scored auto and business banking loans, 
geographic distribution is an indicator of the credit 
performance of the portfolio. Similar to residential 
real estate loans, geographic distribution provides 
insights into the portfolio performance based on 
regional economic activity and events.

(a) Individual delinquency classifications include mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies which were not material at December 31, 
2024 and 2023.
(b) Excludes mortgage loans that are 30 or more days past due insured by U.S. government agencies which were not material at December 31, 
2024 and 2023. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee.
(c) Purchased loans are included in the year in which they were originated.
Approximately 38% of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans. The 
lien position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm’s allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have been 
converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period. That is 
primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the 
minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving period.

(a) Includes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged down to the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell. The 
Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not 
reaffirmed by the borrower (“Chapter 7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual loans, regardless of their delinquency status. At December 31, 2024, 
approximately 8% of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due.
(b) Mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies excluded from nonaccrual loans were not material at December 31, 2024 and 2023.
(c) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered 
collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value 
of the underlying collateral improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.
(d) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $160 million and $180 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
respectively.
(e) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at 
a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to 
the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans 
considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.
(f)
Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.
(g) Includes residential real estate loans, primarily held in LLCs in AWM that did not have a refreshed FICO score. These loans have been included in a FICO 
band based on management’s estimation of the borrower’s credit quality.
(h) Included U.S. government-guaranteed loans as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
(i)
Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.

Loan modifications 
The Firm grants certain modifications of residential 
real estate loans to borrowers experiencing financial 
difficulty. The Firm's proprietary modification 
programs as well as government programs, including 
U.S. GSE programs, that generally provide various 
modifications to borrowers experiencing financial 
difficulty including, but not limited to, interest rate 
reductions, term extensions, other-than-insignificant 
payment deferral and principal forgiveness that would 
otherwise have been required under the terms of the 
original agreement, are considered FDMs. 
In addition, the Firm offers trial modifications of 
residential real estate loans, which generally include a 
three-month trial payment period during which the 
borrower makes monthly payments under the 
proposed modified loan terms. Loans in a trial 
payment period continue to age and accrue interest in 
accordance with the original contractual terms. At the 
completion of a trial period, the loan modification is 
considered permanent.
Financial effects of FDMs
For the year ended December 31, 2024, retained 
residential real estate FDMs were $206 million. The 
financial effects of the FDMs, which were 
predominantly in the form of term extensions and 
interest rate reductions, included extending the 
weighted-average life of the loans by 15 years, and 
reducing the weighted-average contractual interest 
rate from 7.53% to 5.44% for the year ended 
December 31, 2024. 
For the year ended December 31, 2023, retained 
residential real estate FDMs were $136 million. The 
financial effects of the FDMs, which were 
predominantly in the form of term extensions and 
interest rate reductions, included extending the 
weighted-average life of the loans by 20 years, and 
reducing the weighted-average contractual interest 
rate from 7.21% to 4.44% for the year ended 
December 31, 2023. 
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no 
additional commitments to lend to borrowers 
experiencing financial difficulty whose loans have been 
modified as FDMs.
For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
loans subject to a trial modification, where the terms of 
the loans have not been permanently modified, and 
Chapter 7 loans were not material.
Payment status of FDMs

the default were $93 million. Retained residential real 
estate FDMs that defaulted during the year ended 
December 31, 2023 and that were reported as FDMs 
on or after January 1, 2023, the date that the Firm 
adopted the changes to the TDR accounting guidance 
were not material. Refer to Note 1 for further 
information.

Nature and extent of TDRs
For periods ending prior to January 1, 2023, 
modifications of residential real estate loans where the 
Firm granted concessions to borrowers who were 
experiencing financial difficulty were generally 
accounted for and reported as TDRs. Loans with shortterm or other insignificant modifications that were not 
considered concessions were not TDRs. For the year 
ended December 31, 2022, new TDRs were $362 
million, and there were no additional commitments to 
lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans 
were modified in TDRs. 
The Firm’s proprietary modification programs as well 
as government programs, including U.S. GSE 
programs, generally provide various concessions to 
financially troubled borrowers including, but not 
limited to, interest rate reductions, term or payment 
extensions and delays of principal and/or interest 
payments that would otherwise have been required 
under the terms of the original agreement. 
The following table provides information about how 
residential real estate loans were modified in TDRs 
during the period presented. This table excludes loans

(a) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In 
accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans 
that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged 
down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their 
underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the 
underlying collateral improves subsequent to charge down, the 
related allowance may be negative.
(b) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis 
was not material for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 
2023.
(c) The geographic regions presented in this table are ordered 
based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at 
December 31, 2024.
Loan modifications 
The Firm grants certain modifications of auto and 
other loans to borrowers experiencing financial 
difficulty.
For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
retained auto and other FDMs were not material. 
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no 
additional commitments to lend to borrowers 
modified as FDMs.
For periods ending prior to January 1, 2023, 
modifications of auto and other loans where the Firm 
granted concessions to borrowers who were 
experiencing financial difficulty were generally 
accounted for and reported as TDRs. Loans with shortterm or other insignificant modifications that were not 
considered concessions were not TDRs. For the year 
ended December 31, 2022, auto and other TDRs were 
not material.

Credit card loan portfolio
The credit card portfolio segment includes credit card 
loans originated and purchased by the Firm. 
Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality 
indicator for credit card loans as they provide an early 
warning that borrowers may be experiencing 
difficulties (30 days past due); information on those 
borrowers that have been delinquent for a longer 
period of time (90 days past due) is also considered. In 
addition to delinquency rates, the geographic 
distribution of the loans provides insight as to the 
credit quality of the portfolio based on the regional 
economy.
While the borrower’s credit score is another general 
indicator of credit quality, the Firm does not view 
credit scores as a primary indicator of credit quality 
because the borrower’s credit score tends to be a 
lagging indicator. The distribution of such scores 
provides a general indicator of credit quality trends 
within the portfolio; however, the score does not 
capture all factors that would be predictive of future 
credit performance. Refreshed FICO score 
information, which is obtained at least quarterly, for a 
statistically significant random sample of the credit 
card portfolio is indicated in other credit quality 
indicators. FICO is considered to be the industry 
benchmark for credit scores.
The Firm generally originates new credit card 
accounts to prime consumer borrowers. However, 
certain cardholders’ FICO scores may decrease over 
time, depending on the performance of the cardholder 
and changes in the credit score calculation.

Loan modifications 
The Firm grants certain modifications of credit card loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. These 
modifications may involve placing the customer’s credit card account on a fixed payment plan, generally for 60 
months, which typically includes reducing the interest rate on the credit card account. If the borrower does not 
make the contractual payments when due under the modified payment terms, the credit card loan continues to age 
and will be charged-off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy. In most cases, the Firm does not 
reinstate the borrower's line of credit.

Defaults of FDMs
Retained credit card FDMs that defaulted during the 
year ended December 31, 2024 and that were reported 
as FDMs in the twelve months prior to the default were 
not material. Retained credit card FDMs that defaulted 
during the year ended December 31, 2023 and that 
were reported as FDMs on or after January 1, 2023, the 
date that the Firm adopted the changes to the TDR 
accounting guidance were not material. Refer to Note 1 
for further information.
For credit card loans modified as FDMs, payment 
default is deemed to have occurred when the borrower 
misses two consecutive contractual payments. 
Defaulted modified credit card loans remain in the 
modification program and continue to be charged off 
in accordance with the Firm’s standard charge-off 
policy.
Financial effects of TDRs and defaults 
For periods ending prior to January 1, 2023, 
modifications of credit card loans where the Firm 
granted concessions to borrowers who were 
experiencing financial difficulty were generally 
accounted for and reported as TDRs. The Firm granted 
concessions for most of the credit card loans under 
long-term programs. These concessions involved 
placing the customer’s credit card account on a fixed 
payment plan, generally for 60 months, and typically 
included reducing the interest rate on the credit card 
account. Substantially all modifications under the 
Firm’s long-term programs were considered to be 
TDRs. Loans with short-term or other insignificant 
modifications that were not considered concessions 
were not reported as TDRs.
The following table provides information about the 
financial effects of the concessions granted on credit 
card loans modified in TDRs and defaults for the 
periods presented. For the period disclosed, new 
enrollments were less than 1% of total retained credit 
card loans.

For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment 
default was deemed to have occurred when the 
borrower missed two consecutive contractual 
payments. Defaulted modified credit card loans 
remained in the modification program and continued 
to be charged of in accordance with the Firm’s 
standard charge-off policy.

Wholesale loan portfolio
Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of 
clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional 
clients to small businesses and high-net-worth 
individuals.
The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans 
is the internal risk rating assigned to each loan. Risk 
ratings are used to identify the credit quality of loans 
and differentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk ratings 
on loans consider the PD and the LGD. The PD is the 
likelihood that a loan will default. The LGD is the 
estimated loss on the loan that would be realized upon 
the default of the borrower and takes into 
consideration collateral and structural support for 
each credit facility. 
Management considers several factors to determine 
an appropriate internal risk rating, including the 
obligor’s debt capacity and financial flexibility, the 
level of the obligor’s earnings, the amount and sources 
for repayment, the level and nature of contingencies, 
management strength, and the industry and 
geography in which the obligor operates. The Firm’s 
internal risk ratings generally align with the qualitative 
characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet 
financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in 
the economic environment) defined by S&P and 
Moody’s, however the quantitative characteristics 
(e.g., PD and LGD) may differ as they reflect internal 
historical experiences and assumptions. The Firm 
generally considers internal ratings with qualitative 
characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as 
investment grade, and these ratings have a lower PD 
and/or lower LGD than non-investment grade ratings. 
Noninvestment-grade ratings are further classified as 
noncriticized and criticized, and the criticized portion 
is further subdivided into performing and nonaccrual 
loans, representing management’s assessment of the 
collectibility of principal and interest. Criticized loans 
have a higher PD than noncriticized loans. The Firm’s 
definition of criticized aligns with the U.S. banking 
regulatory definition of criticized exposures, which 
consist of special mention, substandard and doubtful 
categories. Refer to Note 1 for additional information. 
Risk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing 
basis by Credit Risk Management and are adjusted as 
necessary for updated information affecting the 
obligor’s ability to fulfill its obligations.
As noted above, the risk rating of a loan considers the 
industry in which the obligor conducts its operations. 
As part of the overall credit risk management 
framework, the Firm focuses on the management and 
diversification of its industry and client exposures, with 
particular attention paid to industries with an actual or 
potential credit concern. Refer to Note 4 for further 
detail on industry concentrations.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, additional unfunded commitments on modified loans to borrowers experiencing 
financial difficulty were $1.8 billion at each period in Commercial and industrial, and $69 million and $4 million, 
respectively, in Other loan class. Additional commitments on modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial 
difficulty whose loans have been modified as FDMs in Secured by real estate were not material at each period.
Nature and extent of TDRs
Prior to January 1, 2023, certain loan modifications were considered TDRs. These loan modifications provided 
various concessions to borrower who were experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other 
insignificant modifications that were not considered concessions were not TDRs nor were loans for which the Firm 
elected to suspend TDR accounting guidance under the option provided by the CARES Act.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, new TDRs were $801 million. New TDRs for the year ended December 31, 
2022 reflected extended maturity dates and covenant waivers primarily in the Commercial and Industrial loan class. 
For the year ended December 31, 2022, the impact of these modifications resulting in new TDRs was not material to 
the Firm. 
As a result of the elimination of the requirement to assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves 
a concession, the population of loans considered FDMs is greater than the population previously considered TDRs.

Note 13 – Allowance for credit losses
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents 
management's estimate of expected credit losses over 
the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial 
assets measured at amortized cost and certain offbalance sheet lending-related commitments. The 
allowance for credit losses generally comprises:
• the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s 
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated), 
• the allowance for lending-related commitments, 
which is presented on the Consolidated balance 
sheets in accounts payable and other liabilities, and 
• the allowance for credit losses on investment 
securities, which is reflected in investment securities 
on the Consolidated balance sheets.
The income statement effect of all changes in the 
allowance for credit losses is recognized in the 
provision for credit losses. 
Determining the appropriateness of the allowance for 
credit losses is complex and requires significant 
judgment by management about the effect of matters 
that are inherently uncertain. At least quarterly, the 
allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the CRO, the 
CFO and the Controller of the Firm. Subsequent 
evaluations of credit exposures, considering the 
macroeconomic conditions, forecasts and other factors 
then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the 
allowance for credit losses in future periods. 
The Firm’s policies used to determine its allowance for 
loan losses and its allowance for lending-related 
commitments are described in the following 
paragraphs. Refer to Note 10 for a description of the 
policies used to determine the allowance for credit 
losses on investment securities. 
Methodology for allowances for loan losses and 
lending-related commitments
The allowance for loan losses and allowance for 
lending-related commitments represents expected 
credit losses over the remaining expected life of 
retained loans and lending-related commitments that 
are not unconditionally cancellable. The Firm does not 
record an allowance for future draws on unconditionally 
cancellable lending-related commitments (e.g., credit 
cards). Expected losses related to accrued interest on 
credit card loans are considered in the Firm’s allowance 
for loan losses. However, the Firm does not record an 
allowance on other accrued interest receivables, due to 
its policy to write these receivables off no later than 90 
days past due by reversing interest income. 
The expected life of each instrument is determined by 
considering its contractual term, expected 
prepayments, cancellation features, and certain 
extension and call options. The expected life of funded 
credit card loans is generally estimated by considering 
expected future payments on the credit card account, 
and determining how much of those amounts should be 
allocated to repayments of the funded loan balance (as 
of the balance sheet date) versus other account activity. 
This allocation is made using an approach that 
incorporates the payment application requirements of 
the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and 
Disclosure Act of 2009, generally paying down the 
highest interest rate balances first. 
The estimate of expected credit losses includes 
expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off 
or expected to be charged off, even if such recoveries 
result in a negative allowance. 
Collective and Individual Assessments
When calculating the allowance for loan losses and the 
allowance for lending-related commitments, the Firm 
assesses whether exposures share similar risk 
characteristics. If similar risk characteristics exist, the 
Firm estimates expected credit losses collectively, 
considering the risk associated with a particular pool 
and the probability that the exposures within the pool 
will deteriorate or default. The assessment of risk 
characteristics is subject to significant management 
judgment. Emphasizing one characteristic over another 
or considering additional characteristics could affect 
the allowance. 
• Relevant risk characteristics for the consumer 
portfolio include product type, delinquency status, 
current FICO scores, geographic distribution, and, for 
collateralized loans, current LTV ratios. 
• Relevant risk characteristics for the wholesale 
portfolio include risk rating, delinquency status, 
tenor, level and type of collateral, LOB, geography, 
industry, credit enhancement, product type, facility 
purpose, and payment terms. 
The majority of the Firm’s credit exposures share risk 
characteristics with other similar exposures, and as a 
result are collectively assessed for impairment 
(“portfolio-based component”). The portfolio-based 
component covers consumer loans, performing riskrated loans and certain lending-related commitments. 
If an exposure does not share risk characteristics with 
other exposures, the Firm generally estimates expected 
credit losses on an individual basis, considering 
expected repayment and conditions impacting that 
individual exposure (“asset-specific component”). The 
asset-specific component covers collateral-dependent 
loans and risk-rated loans that have been placed on 
nonaccrual status. 
Portfolio-based component
The portfolio-based component begins with a 
quantitative calculation that considers the likelihood of 
the borrower changing delinquency status or moving 
from one risk rating to another. The quantitative 
calculation covers expected credit losses over an 
instrument’s expected life and is estimated by applying 
credit loss factors to the Firm’s estimated exposure at 
default. The credit loss factors incorporate the 
Notes to consolidated financial statements

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

probability of borrower default as well as loss severity in 
the event of default. They are derived using a weighted 
average of five internally developed macroeconomic 
scenarios over an eight-quarter forecast period, 
followed by a single year straight-line interpolation to 
revert to long run historical information for periods 
beyond the eight-quarter forecast period. The five 
macroeconomic scenarios consist of a central, relative 
adverse, extreme adverse, relative upside and extreme 
upside scenario, and are updated by the Firm’s central 
forecasting team. The scenarios take into consideration 
the Firm’s macroeconomic outlook, internal 
perspectives from subject matter experts across the 
Firm, and market consensus and involve a governed 
process that incorporates feedback from senior 
management across LOBs, Corporate Finance and Risk 
Management.
The quantitative calculation is adjusted to take into 
consideration model imprecision, emerging risk 
assessments, trends and other subjective factors that 
are not yet reflected in the calculation. These 
adjustments are accomplished in part by analyzing the 
historical loss experience, including during stressed 
periods, for each major product or model. Management 
applies judgment in making this adjustment, including 
taking into account uncertainties associated with the 
economic and political conditions, quality of 
underwriting standards, borrower behavior, credit 
concentrations or deterioration within an industry, 
product or portfolio, as well as other relevant internal 
and external factors affecting the credit quality of the 
portfolio. In certain instances, the interrelationships 
between these factors create further uncertainties.
The application of different inputs into the quantitative 
calculation, and the assumptions used by management 
to adjust the quantitative calculation, are subject to 
significant management judgment, and emphasizing 
one input or assumption over another, or considering 
other inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate 
of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for 
lending-related commitments.
Asset-specific component 
To determine the asset-specific component of the 
allowance, collateral-dependent loans (including those 
loans for which foreclosure is probable) and nonaccrual 
risk-rated loans in the wholesale portfolio segment are 
generally evaluated individually.
For collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of 
collateral less estimated costs to sell, as applicable, is 
used to determine the charge-off amount for declines in 
value (to reduce the amortized cost of the loan to the 
fair value of collateral) or the amount of negative 
allowance that should be recognized (for recoveries of 
prior charge-offs associated with improvements in the 
fair value of the collateral).
For non-collateral dependent loans, the Firm generally 
measures the asset-specific allowance as the 
difference between the amortized cost of the loan and 
the present value of the cash flows expected to be 
collected, discounted at the loan’s effective interest 
rate. Subsequent changes in impairment are generally 
recognized as an adjustment to the allowance for loan 
losses. The asset-specific component of the allowance 
for non-collateral dependent loans incorporates the 
effect of the modification on the loan’s expected cash 
flows including changes in interest rates, principal 
forgiveness, and other concessions, as well as 
management’s expectation of the borrower’s ability to 
repay under the modified terms. 
Estimating the timing and amounts of future cash flows 
is highly judgmental as these cash flow projections rely 
upon estimates such as loss severities, asset 
valuations, the amounts and timing of interest or 
principal payments (including any expected 
prepayments) or other factors that are reflective of 
current and expected market conditions. These 
estimates are, in turn, dependent on factors such as the 
duration of current overall economic conditions, 
industry, portfolio, or borrower-specific factors, the 
expected outcome of insolvency proceedings as well 
as, in certain circumstances, other economic factors. All 
of these estimates and assumptions require significant 
management judgment and certain assumptions are 
highly subjective. 
Other financial assets
In addition to loans and investment securities, the Firm 
holds other financial assets that are measured at 
amortized cost on the Consolidated balance sheets, 
including credit exposures arising from lending 
activities subject to collateral maintenance 
requirements. Management estimates the allowance 
for other financial assets using various techniques 
considering historical losses and current economic 
conditions. 
Credit risk arising from lending activities subject to 
collateral maintenance requirements is generally 
mitigated by factors such as the short-term nature of 
the activity, the fair value of collateral held and the 
Firm’s right to call for, and the borrower’s obligation to 
provide additional margin when the fair value of the 
collateral declines. Because of these mitigating factors, 
these exposures generally do not require an allowance 
for credit losses. However, management may also 
consider other factors such as the borrower’s ongoing 
ability to provide collateral to satisfy margin 
requirements, or whether collateral is significantly 
concentrated in an individual issuer or in securities with 
similar risk characteristics. If in management’s 
judgment, an allowance for credit losses for these 
exposures is required, the Firm estimates expected 
credit losses based on the value of the collateral and 
probability of borrower default.

Discussion of changes in the allowance
The allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 
2024 was $26.9 billion, reflecting a net addition of $2.1 
billion from December 31, 2023.
The net addition to the allowance for credit losses 
included:
• $2.1 billion in consumer, reflecting: 
– a $2.2 billion net addition in Card Services, 
predominantly driven by loan growth, reflecting 
higher revolving balances, including the seasoning 
of vintages originated in recent years, 
partially offset by 
– a $125 million net reduction in Home Lending in 
the first quarter of 2024, and 
• a net reduction of $30 million in wholesale, 
reflecting: 
– changes in certain macroeconomic variables, an 
update to loss assumptions on certain loans in 
Markets, and a reduction due to charge-offs 
largely from collateral-dependent loans, 
predominantly offset by 
– net downgrade activity, primarily in Real Estate, 
and the impact of incorporating the First Republic 
portfolio into the Firm’s modeled credit loss 
estimates in the second quarter of 2024.
The Firm’s qualitative adjustments continued to 
include additional weight placed on the adverse 
scenarios to reflect ongoing uncertainties and 
downside risks related to the geopolitical and 
macroeconomic environment.
The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated 
using a weighted average of five internally developed 
macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios 
incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors 
than the central case assumptions provided in the 
table below, resulting in:
• a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking 
at 5.5% in the fourth quarter of 2025, and
• a weighted average U.S. real GDP level that is 1.9% 
lower than the central case at the end of the second 
quarter of 2026.

assumptions for the periods presented:

The Firm’s other business segments and Corporate are also involved with VIEs (both third-party and Firmsponsored), but to a lesser extent, as follows: 
• Asset & Wealth Management: AWM sponsors and manages certain funds that are deemed VIEs. As asset 
manager of the funds, AWM earns a fee based on assets managed; the fee varies with each fund’s investment 
objective and is competitively priced. For fund entities that qualify as VIEs, AWM’s interests are, in certain cases, 
considered to be significant variable interests that result in consolidation of the financial results of these entities.
• Corporate: Corporate is involved with entities that may meet the definition of VIEs; however these entities are 
generally subject to specialized investment company accounting, which does not require the consolidation of 
investments, including VIEs. In addition, Treasury and CIO invest in securities generally issued by third parties 
which may meet the definition of VIEs (e.g., issuers of asset-backed securities). In general, the Firm does not have 
the power to direct the significant activities of these entities and therefore does not consolidate these entities. 
Refer to Note 10 for further information on the Firm’s investment securities portfolio.
In addition, CIB also invests in and provides financing, lending-related services and other services to VIEs 
sponsored by third parties. Refer to page 276 of this Note for more information on the VIEs sponsored by third 
parties.
Significant Firm-sponsored VIEs
Credit card securitizations
CCB’s Card Services business may securitize 
originated credit card loans, primarily through the 
Chase Issuance Trust (the “Trust”). The Firm’s 
continuing involvement in credit card securitizations 
includes servicing the receivables, retaining an 
undivided seller’s interest in the receivables, retaining 
certain senior and subordinated securities and 
maintaining escrow accounts. 
The Firm consolidates the assets and liabilities of its 
sponsored credit card trusts as it is considered to be 
the primary beneficiary of these securitization trusts 
based on the Firm’s ability to direct the activities of 
these VIEs through its servicing responsibilities and 
other duties, including making decisions as to the 
receivables that are transferred into those trusts and 
as to any related modifications and workouts. 
Additionally, the nature and extent of the Firm’s other 
continuing involvement with the trusts, as indicated 
above, obligates the Firm to absorb losses and gives 
the Firm the right to receive certain benefits from 
these VIEs that could potentially be significant. 
The underlying securitized credit card receivables and 
other assets of the securitization trusts are available 
only for payment of the beneficial interests issued by 
the securitization trusts; they are not available to pay 
the Firm’s other obligations or the claims of the Firm’s 
creditors. 
The agreements with the credit card securitization 
trusts require the Firm to maintain a minimum 
undivided interest in the credit card trusts (generally 
5%). As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Firm held 
undivided interests in Firm-sponsored credit card 
securitization trusts of $6.6 billion and $4.9 billion, 
respectively. The Firm maintained an average 
undivided interest in principal receivables owned by 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

those trusts of approximately 45% and 65% for the 
years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
respectively. The Firm did not retain any senior 
securities and retained $1.5 billion of subordinated 
securities in certain of its credit card securitization 
trusts at both December 31, 2024 and 2023. The Firm’s 
undivided interests in the credit card trusts and 
securities retained are eliminated in consolidation. 
Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization 
trusts
The Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated 
and purchased residential mortgages, commercial 
mortgages and other consumer loans primarily in its 
CCB and CIB businesses. Depending on the particular 
transaction, as well as the respective business 
involved, the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans 
and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the 
securitization trusts.
The following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label 
securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are 
consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or 
subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or 
guarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is 
servicing the loans. The Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased interests is the carrying value 
of these interests. Refer to page 279 of this Note for information on the securitization-related loan delinquencies and 
liquidation losses.

Residential mortgage
The Firm securitizes residential mortgage loans 
originated by CCB, as well as residential mortgage 
loans purchased from third parties by either CCB or 
CIB. CCB generally retains servicing for all residential 
mortgage loans it originated or purchased, and for 
certain mortgage loans purchased by CIB. For 
securitizations of loans serviced by CCB, the Firm has 
the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE 
because it is responsible for decisions related to loan 
modifications and workouts. CCB may also retain an 
interest upon securitization.
In addition, CIB engages in underwriting and trading 
activities involving securities issued by Firmsponsored securitization trusts. As a result, CIB at 
times retains senior and/or subordinated interests 
(including residual interests and amounts required to 
be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules) in 
residential mortgage securitizations at the time of 
securitization, and/or reacquires positions in the 
secondary market in the normal course of business. In 
certain instances, as a result of the positions retained 
or reacquired by CIB or held by Treasury and CIO or 
CCB, when considered together with the servicing 
arrangements entered into by CCB, the Firm is 
deemed to be the primary beneficiary of certain 
securitization trusts. 
The Firm does not consolidate residential mortgage 
securitizations (Firm-sponsored or third-partysponsored) when it is not the servicer (and therefore 
does not have the power to direct the most significant 
activities of the trust) or does not hold a beneficial 
interest in the trust that could potentially be significant 
to the trust.
Commercial mortgages and other consumer 
securitizations
CIB originates and securitizes commercial mortgage 
loans, and engages in underwriting and trading 
activities involving the securities issued by 
securitization trusts. CIB may retain unsold senior and/
or subordinated interests (including amounts required 
to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules) in 
commercial mortgage securitizations at the time of 
securitization but, generally, the Firm does not service 
commercial loan securitizations. Treasury and CIO 
may choose to invest in these securitizations as well. 
For commercial mortgage securitizations the power to 
direct the significant activities of the VIE generally is 
held by the servicer or investors in a specified class of 
securities (“controlling class”). The Firm generally 
does not retain an interest in the controlling class in its 
sponsored commercial mortgage securitization 
transactions.
Re-securitizations
The Firm engages in certain re-securitization 
transactions in which debt securities are transferred to 
a VIE in exchange for new beneficial interests. These 
transfers occur in connection with both U.S. GSEs and 
government agency sponsored VIEs, which are 
backed by residential mortgages. The Firm’s 
consolidation analysis is largely dependent on the 
Firm’s role and interest in the re-securitization trusts.
The following table presents the principal amount of 
securities transferred to re-securitization VIEs.
Year ended December 31, 
(in millions)

Transfers of securities to VIEs
U.S. GSEs and government 
agencies
$ 44,456 
$ 18,864 
$ 16,128 
Most re-securitizations with which the Firm is involved 
are client-driven transactions in which a specific client 
or group of clients is seeking a specific return or risk 
profile. For these transactions, the Firm has concluded 
that the decision-making power of the entity is shared 
between the Firm and its clients, considering the joint 
effort and decisions in establishing the resecuritization trust and its assets, as well as the 
significant economic interest the client holds in the resecuritization trust; therefore the Firm does not 
consolidate the re-securitization VIE.
The Firm did not transfer any private label securities to 
re-securitization VIEs during 2024, 2023 and 2022, 
and retained interests in any such Firm-sponsored 
VIEs as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were not 
material.
Additionally, the Firm may invest in beneficial interests 
of third-party-sponsored re-securitizations and 
generally purchases these interests in the secondary 
market. In these circumstances, the Firm does not 
have the unilateral ability to direct the most significant 
activities of the re-securitization trust, either because 
it was not involved in the initial design of the trust, or 
the Firm was involved with an independent third-party 
sponsor and demonstrated shared power over the 
creation of the trust; therefore, the Firm does not 
consolidate the re-securitization VIE.

Multi-seller conduits
Multi-seller conduit entities are separate bankruptcy 
remote entities that provide secured financing, 
collateralized by pools of receivables and other 
financial assets, to customers of the Firm. The 
conduits fund their financing facilities through the 
issuance of highly rated commercial paper. The 
primary source of repayment of the commercial paper 
is the cash flows from the pools of assets. In most 
instances, the assets are structured with deal-specific 
credit enhancements provided to the conduits by the 
customers (i.e., sellers) or other third parties. Dealspecific credit enhancements are generally structured 
to cover a multiple of historical losses expected on the 
pool of assets, and are typically in the form of 
overcollateralization provided by the seller. The dealspecific credit enhancements mitigate the Firm’s 
potential losses on its agreements with the conduits.
To ensure timely repayment of the commercial paper, 
and to provide the conduits with funding to provide 
financing to customers in the event that the conduits 
do not obtain funding in the commercial paper market, 
each asset pool financed by the conduits has a 
minimum 100% deal-specific liquidity facility 
associated with it provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
N.A. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. also provides the 
multi-seller conduit vehicles with uncommitted 
program-wide liquidity facilities and program-wide 
credit enhancement in the form of standby letters of 
credit. The amount of program-wide credit 
enhancement required is based upon commercial 
paper issuance and approximates 10% of the 
outstanding balance of commercial paper.
The Firm consolidates its Firm-administered multiseller conduits, as the Firm has both the power to 
direct the significant activities of the conduits and a 
potentially significant economic interest in the 
conduits. As administrative agent and in its role in 
structuring transactions, the Firm makes decisions 
regarding asset types and credit quality, and manages 
the commercial paper funding needs of the conduits. 
The Firm’s interests that could potentially be 
significant to the VIEs include the fees received as 
administrative agent and liquidity and program-wide 
credit enhancement provider, as well as the potential 
exposure created by the liquidity and credit 
enhancement facilities provided to the conduits.
In the normal course of business, JPMorganChase 
makes markets in and invests in commercial paper 
issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. 
The Firm held $2.9 billion and $9.8 billion of the 
commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered 
multi-seller conduits at December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
respectively, which have been eliminated in 
consolidation. The Firm’s investments reflect the 
Firm’s funding needs and capacity and were not driven 
by market illiquidity. Other than the amounts required 
to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules, the 
Firm is not obligated under any agreement to 
purchase the commercial paper issued by the Firmadministered multi-seller conduits.
Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity 
and credit enhancement provided by the Firm have 
been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firmadministered multi-seller conduits provide lendingrelated commitments to certain clients of the Firmadministered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded 
commitments were $10.3 billion and $10.8 billion at 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are 
reported as off-balance sheet lending-related 
commitments in other unfunded commitments to 
extend credit. Refer to Note 28 for more information 
on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. 
Municipal bond vehicles
Municipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”) 
trusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond 
investments at short-term rates. In a typical TOB 
transaction, the trust purchases highly rated municipal 
bond(s) of a single issuer and funds the purchase by 
issuing two types of securities: (1) puttable floatingrate certificates (“floaters”) and (2) inverse floatingrate residual interests (“residuals”). The floaters are 
typically purchased by money market funds or other 
short-term investors and may be tendered, with 
requisite notice, to the TOB trust. The residuals are 
retained by the investor seeking to finance its 
municipal bond investment. TOB transactions where 
the residual is held by a third-party investor are 
typically known as customer TOB trusts, and noncustomer TOB trusts are transactions where the 
Residual is retained by the Firm. Customer TOB trusts 
are sponsored by a third party. The Firm serves as 
sponsor for all non-customer TOB transactions. The 
Firm may provide various services to a TOB trust, 
including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option 
provider, and/or sponsor.
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC may serve as a remarketing 
agent on the floaters for TOB trusts. The remarketing 
agent is responsible for establishing the periodic 
variable rate on the floaters, conducting the initial 
Notes to consolidated financial statements

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K
Nonconsolidated 
re-securitization VIEs 2024 

placement and remarketing tendered floaters. The 
remarketing agent may, but is not obligated to, make 
markets in floaters. Floaters held by the Firm were not 
material during 2024 and 2023.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or J.P. Morgan Securities 
LLC often serves as the sole liquidity or tender option 
provider for the TOB trusts. The liquidity provider’s 
obligation to perform is conditional and is limited by 
certain events (“Termination Events”), which include 
bankruptcy or failure to pay by the municipal bond 
issuer or credit enhancement provider, an event of 
taxability on the municipal bonds or the immediate 
downgrade of the municipal bond to below investment 
grade. In addition, the liquidity provider’s exposure is 
typically further limited by the high credit quality of the 
underlying municipal bonds, the excess 
collateralization in the vehicle, or, in certain 
transactions, the reimbursement agreements with the 
Residual holders.
Holders of the floaters may “put,” or tender, their 
floaters to the TOB trust. If the remarketing agent 
cannot successfully remarket the floaters to another 
investor, the liquidity provider either provides a loan to 
the TOB trust for the TOB trust’s purchase of the 
floaters, or it directly purchases the tendered floaters. 
TOB trusts are considered to be variable interest 
entities. The Firm consolidates non-customer TOB 
trusts because as the Residual holder, the Firm has the 
right to make decisions that significantly impact the 
economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle, 
and it has the right to receive benefits and bear losses 
that could potentially be significant to the municipal 
bond vehicle.

VIEs sponsored by third parties 
The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured 
by other parties. These include, for example, acting as 
a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, 
underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, 
trustee or custodian. These transactions are 
conducted at arm’s-length, and individual credit 
decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, 
taking into consideration the quality of the underlying 
assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to 
direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly 
impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a variable 
interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm 
generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records 
and reports these positions on its Consolidated 
balance sheets in the same manner it would record 
and report positions in respect of any other third-party 
transaction. 
Tax credit vehicles 
The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax 
credit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and 
similar entities that own and operate affordable 
housing, alternative energy, and other projects. These 
entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is 
typically the general partner or managing member and 
has control over the significant activities of the tax 
credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not 
consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally 
invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and 
earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax 
credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss 
exposure, represented by equity investments and 
funding commitments, was $35.2 billion and $35.1 
billion, of which $15.0 billion and $14.7 billion was 
unfunded at December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
respectively. The Firm assesses each project and to 
reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts 
of its capital investment until the project qualifies for 
tax credits. Refer to Note 28 for more information on 
off-balance sheet lending-related commitments.
Effective January 1, 2024, the Firm adopted updates to 
the Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit 
Structures Using the Proportional Amortization 
Method guidance which expanded the types of taxoriented investments, beyond affordable housing tax 
credit investments, that the Firm can elect on a 
program by program basis, to be accounted for using 
the proportional amortization method. Refer to Notes 
1, 6 and 25 for further information.
The proportional amortization method requires the 
cost of eligible investments, within an elected 
program, be amortized in proportion to the tax 
benefits received with the resulting amortization 
reported directly in income tax expense, which aligns 
with the associated tax credits and other tax benefits. 
Investments must meet certain criteria to be eligible, 
including that substantially all of the return is from 
income tax credits and other income tax benefits.
In addition, under this method deferred taxes are 
generally not recorded as the investment is now 
amortized in proportion to the income tax credits and 
other income tax benefits received. Delayed equity 
contributions that are unconditional and legally 
binding or conditional and probable of occurring are 
recorded in other liabilities with a corresponding 
increase in the carrying value of the investment. The 
guidance also requires a reevaluation of eligible 
investments when significant modifications or events 
occur that result in a change in the nature of the 
investment or a change in the Firm's relationship with 
the underlying project. During the period, there were 
no significant modifications or events that resulted in a 
change in the nature of an eligible investment or a 
change in the Firm's relationship with the underlying 
project.
The following table provides information on taxoriented investments for which the Firm elected to 
apply the proportional amortization method.

Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) 
The Firm may provide various services to customer 
TOB trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or 
tender option provider. In certain customer TOB 
transactions, the Firm, as liquidity provider, has 
entered into a reimbursement agreement with the 
Residual holder. In those transactions, upon the 
termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the 
third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm 
does not have any intent to protect Residual holders 
from potential losses on any of the underlying 
municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate 
customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the 
power to make decisions that significantly impact the 
economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle.
The Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider 
to customer TOB trusts at December 31, 2024 and 
2023, was $5.8 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively. 
The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at 
December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $8.1 billion and $7.3 
billion, respectively.
Loan securitizations
The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, 
including residential mortgages, credit card 
receivables, commercial mortgages and other 
consumer loans. The purposes of these securitization 
transactions were to satisfy investor demand and to 
generate liquidity for the Firm.
For loan securitizations in which the Firm is not 
required to consolidate the trust, the Firm records the 
transfer of the loan receivable to the trust as a sale 
when all of the following accounting criteria for a sale 
are met: (1) the transferred financial assets are legally 
isolated from the Firm’s creditors; (2) the transferee or 
beneficial interest holder can pledge or exchange the 
transferred financial assets; and (3) the Firm does not 
maintain effective control over the transferred financial 
assets (e.g., the Firm cannot repurchase the 
transferred assets before their maturity and it does not 
have the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to 
return the transferred assets).
For loan securitizations accounted for as a sale, the 
Firm recognizes a gain or loss based on the difference 
between the value of proceeds received (including 
cash, beneficial interests, or servicing assets received) 
and the carrying value of the assets sold. Gains and 
losses on securitizations are reported in noninterest 
revenue.

In addition to the amounts reported in the 
securitization activity tables above, the Firm, in the 
normal course of business, sells originated and 
purchased mortgage loans and certain originated 
excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis, predominantly 
to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs are sold 
primarily for the purpose of securitization by the U.S. 
GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., 
credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells 
loans into securitization transactions pursuant to 
Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically 
insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government 
agency. The Firm does not consolidate the 
securitization vehicles underlying these transactions 
as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited 
number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a 
portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans 
with the purchaser. Refer to Note 28 for additional 
information about the Firm’s loan sales- and 
securitization-related indemnifications and Note 15 for 
additional information about the impact of the Firm’s

Options to repurchase delinquent loans
In addition to the Firm’s obligation to repurchase 
certain loans due to material breaches of 
representations and warranties as discussed in Note 
28, the Firm also has the option to repurchase 
delinquent loans that it services for Ginnie Mae loan 
pools, as well as for other U.S. government agencies 
under certain arrangements. The Firm typically elects 
to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan 
pools as it continues to service them and/or manage 
the foreclosure process in accordance with the 
applicable requirements, and such loans continue to 
be insured or guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase 
option becomes exercisable, such loans must be 
reported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a loan 
with a corresponding liability. Refer to Note 12 for 
additional information. 
The following table presents loans the Firm 
repurchased or had an option to repurchase, real 
estate owned, and foreclosed government-guaranteed 
residential mortgage loans recognized on the Firm’s 
Consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024

Note 15 – Goodwill, mortgage servicing rights, and other intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill is recorded upon completion of a business 
combination as the difference between the purchase 
price and the fair value of the net assets acquired, and 
can be adjusted up to one year from the acquisition 
date as additional information pertaining to facts and 
circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date is 
obtained about the fair value of assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment 
during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more 
often if events or circumstances, such as adverse 
changes in the business climate, indicate that there 
may be an impairment.
The goodwill associated with each business 
combination is allocated to the related reporting units, 
which are generally determined based on how the 
Firm’s businesses are managed and how they are 
reviewed. The following table presents goodwill 
attributed to the reportable business segments and 
Corporate.

of Global Shares PLC in AWM, Frosch Travel Group, LLC and 
Figg, Inc. in CCB, and Renovite Technologies, Inc. and 
Volkswagen Payments S.A. in CIB.
(b) Primarily foreign currency adjustments.
Goodwill impairment testing
The Firm’s goodwill was not impaired at December 31, 
2024, 2023 and 2022.
The goodwill impairment test is generally performed 
by comparing the current fair value of each reporting 
unit with its carrying value. If the fair value is in excess 
of the carrying value, then the reporting unit’s goodwill 
is considered not to be impaired. If the fair value is less 
than the carrying value, then an impairment is 
recognized for the amount by which the reporting 
unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, up to the 
amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. 
The Firm uses the reporting units’ allocated capital 
plus goodwill and other intangible assets as a proxy for 
the carrying values of equity for the reporting units in 
the goodwill impairment testing. Reporting unit equity 
is determined on a similar basis as the allocation of 
capital to the LOBs which takes into consideration a 
variety of factors including capital levels of similarly 
rated peers and applicable regulatory capital 
requirements. LOB’s allocated capital levels are 
incorporated into the Firm’s annual budget process, 
which is reviewed by the Firm’s Board of Directors and 
Operating Committee. 
The primary method the Firm uses to estimate the fair 
value of its reporting units is the income approach. 
This approach projects cash flows for the forecast 
period and uses the perpetuity growth method to 
calculate terminal values. These cash flows and 
terminal values, which are based on the reporting 
units’ annual budgets and forecasts are then 
discounted using an appropriate discount rate. The 
discount rate used for each reporting unit represents 
an estimate of the cost of equity for that reporting unit 
and is determined considering the Firm’s overall 
estimated cost of equity (estimated using the Capital 
Asset Pricing Model), as adjusted for the risk 
characteristics specific to each reporting unit (for 
example, for higher levels of risk or uncertainty 
associated with the business or management’s 
forecasts and assumptions). To assess the 
reasonableness of the discount rates used for each 
reporting unit, management compares the discount 
rate to the estimated cost of equity for publicly traded 
institutions with similar businesses and risk 
characteristics. In addition, the weighted average cost 
of equity (aggregating the various reporting units) is 
compared with the Firm’s overall estimated cost of 
equity for reasonableness. The valuations derived 
from the discounted cash flow analysis are then 
compared with market-based trading and transaction 
multiples for relevant competitors. Trading and 
transaction comparables are used as general 
indicators to assess the overall reasonableness of the 
estimated fair values, although precise conclusions 
generally cannot be drawn due to the differences that 
Notes to consolidated financial statements

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

naturally exist between the Firm’s businesses and 
competitor institutions. 
The Firm also takes into consideration a comparison 
between the aggregate fair values of the Firm’s 
reporting units and JPMorganChase’s market 
capitalization. In evaluating this comparison, the Firm 
considers several factors, including (i) a control 
premium that would exist in a market transaction, (ii) 
factors related to the level of execution risk that would 
exist at the Firmwide level that do not exist at the 
reporting unit level and (iii) short-term market volatility 
and other factors that do not directly affect the value of 
individual reporting units.
Unanticipated declines in business performance, 
increases in credit losses, increases in capital 
requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or 
market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative 
changes or increases in the estimated market cost of 
equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the 
Firm’s reporting units to decline in the future, which 
could result in a material impairment loss to earnings 
in a future period related to some portion of the 
associated goodwill. 
Mortgage servicing rights
MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash 
flows for performing servicing activities for others. The 
fair value considers estimated future servicing fees 
and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to 
service the loans, and generally declines over time as 
net servicing cash flows are received, effectively 
amortizing the MSR asset against contractual 
servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either 
purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale 
or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is 
retained.
As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to 
account for its MSRs at fair value. The Firm treats its 
MSRs as a single class of servicing assets based on the 
availability of market inputs used to measure the fair 
value of its MSR asset and its treatment of MSRs as 
one aggregate pool for risk management purposes. 
The Firm estimates the fair value of MSRs using an 
option-adjusted spread (“OAS”) model, which projects 
MSR cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios in 
conjunction with the Firm’s prepayment model, and 
then discounts these cash flows at risk-adjusted rates. 
The model considers portfolio characteristics, 
contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment 
assumptions, delinquency rates, costs to service, late 
charges and other ancillary revenue, and other 
economic factors. The Firm compares fair value 
estimates and assumptions to observable market data 
where available, and also considers recent market 
activity and actual portfolio experience. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

The fair value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in 
interest rates, including their effect on prepayment 
speeds. MSRs typically decrease in value when 
interest rates decline because declining interest rates 
tend to increase prepayments and therefore reduce 
the expected life of the net servicing cash flows that 
comprise the MSR asset. Conversely, securities (e.g., 
mortgage-backed securities), and certain derivatives 
(e.g., those for which the Firm receives fixed-rate 
interest payments) increase in value when interest 
rates decline. JPMorganChase uses combinations of 
derivatives and securities to manage the risk of 
changes in the fair value of MSRs. The intent is to 
offset any interest-rate related changes in the fair 
value of MSRs with changes in the fair value of the 
related risk management instruments.
The following table summarizes MSR activity for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, 
certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements.

Changes in fair value based on variations in 
assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, 
because the relationship of the change in the 
assumptions to the change in fair value are often 
highly interrelated and may not be linear. In the 
following table, the effect that a change in a particular 
assumption may have on the fair value is calculated 
without changing any other assumption. In reality, 
changes in one factor may result in changes in 
another, which would either magnify or counteract the 
impact of the initial change.
The table below outlines the key economic 
assumptions used to determine the fair value of the 
Firm’s MSRs at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and 
outlines the sensitivities of those fair values to 
immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as

Other intangible assets
The Firm’s finite-lived and indefinite-lived other 
intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair 
value primarily upon completion of a business 
combination. Subsequently, the Firm’s finite-lived 
intangible assets, including core deposit intangibles, 
customer relationship intangibles, and certain other 
intangible assets, are amortized over their useful lives, 
estimated based on the expected future economic 
benefits to the Firm of the intangible asset. The Firm’s 
intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as asset 
management contracts, are not subject to 
amortization and are assessed periodically for 
impairment.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the gross carrying 
values of other intangible assets were $3.8 billion and 
$4.2 billion, respectively, and the accumulated 
amortization was $879 million and $994 million, 
respectively. 
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the net carrying 
values consist of finite-lived intangible assets of $1.7 
billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, as well as 
indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are not subject 
to amortization, of $1.2 billion at both periods.
As of December 31, 2024, other intangible assets 
reflected core deposit and certain wealth management 
customer relationship intangibles related to the First 
Republic acquisition, and asset management 
contracts related to the Firm’s acquisition of the 
remaining 51% interest in CIFM. Refer to Note 34 for 
additional information on the First Republic 
acquisition.
For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
amortization expense was $339 million and $315 
million, respectively. 
The following table presents estimated future

Firm determines that an impairment exists for an 
intangible asset, the impairment is recognized in other 
expense.

(b) Other premises and equipment is comprised of internal-use 
software and furniture and equipment.
JPMorganChase computes depreciation using the 
straight-line method over the estimated useful life for 
buildings and furniture and equipment. The Firm 
depreciates leasehold improvements over the lesser of 
the remainder of the lease term or the estimated useful 
life. The Firm also capitalizes certain costs associated 
with the acquisition or development of internal-use 
software. Once the software is ready for its intended 
use, these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis 
over the software’s expected useful life. The estimated 
useful lives range from 10 to 50 years for buildings and 
leasehold improvements, and 3 to 10 years for internaluse software and furniture and equipment.
Impairment is assessed when events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an 
asset may not be fully recoverable.

Note 18 - Leases
Firm as lessee
At December 31, 2024, JPMorganChase and its 
subsidiaries were obligated under a number of 
noncancellable leases, predominantly operating leases 
for premises and equipment used primarily for 
business purposes. These leases generally have terms 
of 20 years or less, determined based on the 
contractual maturity of the lease, and include periods 
covered by options to extend or terminate the lease 
when the Firm is reasonably certain that it will exercise 
those options. All leases with lease terms greater than 
twelve months are reported as a lease liability with a 
corresponding right-of-use (“ROU”) asset. None of 
these lease agreements impose restrictions on the 
Firm’s ability to pay dividends, engage in debt or 
equity financing transactions or enter into further lease 
agreements. Certain of these leases contain escalation 
clauses that will increase rental payments based on 
maintenance, utility and tax increases, which are nonlease components. The Firm elected not to separate 
lease and non-lease components of a contract for its 
real estate leases. As such, real estate lease payments 
represent payments on both lease and non-lease 
components. 
Operating lease liabilities and ROU assets are 
recognized at the lease commencement date based 
on the present value of the future minimum lease 
payments over the lease term. The future lease 
payments are discounted at a rate that estimates the 
Firm’s collateralized borrowing rate for financing 
instruments of a similar term and are included in 
accounts payable and other liabilities. The operating 
lease ROU assets, predominantly included in premises 
and equipment, also include any lease prepayments 
made, plus initial direct costs incurred, less any lease 
incentives received. Rental expense associated with 
operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term, and generally included in 
occupancy expense in the Consolidated statements of 
income. 
The carrying values of the Firm’s operating leases 
were as follows:

Firm as lessor
The Firm provides auto and equipment lease financing 
to its customers through lease arrangements with 
lease terms that may contain renewal, termination 
and/or purchase options. The Firm’s lease financings 
are predominantly auto operating leases. These assets 
subject to operating leases are recognized in other 
assets on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets and 
are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease 
term to reduce the asset to its estimated residual 
value. Depreciation expense is included in technology, 
communications and equipment expense in the 
Consolidated statements of income. The Firm’s lease 
income is generally recognized on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term and is included in other income in 
the Consolidated statements of income. 
On a periodic basis, the Firm assesses leased assets 
for impairment, and if the carrying amount of the 
leased asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows 
from the lease payments and the estimated residual 
value upon disposition of the leased asset, an 
impairment is recognized. 
The risk of loss on auto and equipment leased assets 
relating to the residual value of the leased assets is 
monitored through projections of the asset residual 
values at lease origination and periodic review of 
residual values, and is mitigated through 
arrangements with certain manufacturers or lessees. 
The following table presents the carrying value of 
assets subject to leases reported on the Consolidated 
balance sheets.

Accounts payable and other liabilities consist of 
brokerage payables, which include payables to 
customers and payables related to security purchases 
that did not settle, as well as other accrued expenses, 
such as compensation accruals, credit card rewards 
liability, merchant servicing payables, operating lease

(a) Includes credit card rewards liability of $14.4 billion and $13.2 
billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The credit card rewards liability represents the 
estimated cost of rewards points earned and expected 
to be redeemed by cardholders. The liability is accrued 
as the cardholder earns the benefit and is reduced 
when the cardholder redeems points. The redemption 
rate and cost per point assumptions are key 
assumptions to estimate the liability and the current 
period impact is recognized in Card Income.
Refer to Notes 7, 18, 25 and 30 for additional 
information on accrued interest, operating lease 
liabilities, income taxes and litigation reserves, 
respectively.

modify exposure to interest rate and currency 
exchange rate movements, JPMorganChase utilizes 
derivative instruments, primarily interest rate and 
cross-currency interest rate swaps, in conjunction with 
some of its debt issuances. The use of these 
instruments modifies the Firm’s interest expense on 
the associated debt. The modified weighted-average 
interest rates for total long-term debt, including the 
effects of related derivative instruments, were 5.15% 
and 5.20% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023,

respectively. 
The Firm’s unsecured debt does not contain 
requirements that would call for an acceleration of 
payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the 
existing debt, provide any limitations on future 
borrowings or require additional collateral, based on 
unfavorable changes in the Firm’s credit ratings, 
financial ratios, earnings or stock price.

On June 28, 2024, the Firm announced that its Board 
of Directors had authorized a new $30 billion common 
share repurchase program, effective July 1, 2024. 
Through June 30, 2024, the Firm was authorized to 
purchase up to $30 billion of common shares under its 
previously-approved common share repurchase 
program that was announced on April 13, 2022.
The following table sets forth the Firm’s repurchases of 
common stock for the years ended December 31, 
2024, 2023 and 2022.

(a) Excludes excise tax and commissions. As part of the Inflation 
Reduction Act of 2022, a 1% excise tax is imposed on net share 
repurchases commencing January 1, 2023.
(b) In the second half of 2022, the Firm temporarily suspended 
share repurchases, which it resumed in the first quarter of 2023 
under its common share repurchase program.
The Board of Directors’ authorization to repurchase 
common shares is utilized at management’s 
discretion. The $30 billion common share repurchase 
program approved by the Board of Directors does not 
establish specific price targets or timetables. 
Management determines the amount and timing of 
common share repurchases based on various factors, 
including market conditions; legal and regulatory 
considerations affecting the amount and timing of 
repurchase activity; the Firm’s capital position (taking 
into account goodwill and intangibles); organic capital 
generation; current and proposed future capital 
requirements; and other investment opportunities. The 
amount of common shares that the Firm repurchases 
in any period may be substantially more or less than 
the amounts estimated or actually repurchased in 
prior periods, reflecting the dynamic nature of the 
decision-making process. The Firm’s common share 
repurchases may be suspended by management at 
any time; and may be executed through open market 
purchases or privately negotiated transactions, or 
utilizing Rule 10b5-1 plans, which are written trading 
plans that the Firm may enter into from time to time 
under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 and which allow the Firm to repurchase its 
common shares during periods when it may otherwise 
not be repurchasing common shares — for example, 
during internal trading blackout periods.
As of December 31, 2024, approximately 58.8 million 
shares of common stock were reserved for issuance 
under various employee incentive, compensation, 
option and stock purchase plans, and directors’ 
compensation plans.

Note 23 – Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated using 
the two-class method. Under the two-class method, all 
earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated 
to common stock and participating securities. 
JPMorganChase grants RSUs under its share-based 
compensation programs, predominantly all of which 
entitle recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends 
during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to 
dividends paid to holders of the Firm’s common stock. 
These unvested RSUs meet the definition of 
participating securities based on their respective 
rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends, and they are 
treated as a separate class of securities in computing 
basic EPS. Participating securities are not included as 
incremental shares in computing diluted EPS; refer to 
Note 9 for additional information.
Diluted EPS incorporates the potential impact of 
contingently issuable shares, including awards which 
require future service as a condition of delivery of the 
underlying common stock. Diluted EPS is calculated 
under both the two-class and treasury stock methods, 
and the more dilutive amount is reported. For each of 
the periods presented in the table below, diluted EPS 
calculated under the two-class method was more 
dilutive.
The following table presents the calculation of net 
income applicable to common stockholders and basic 
and diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 
2024, 2023 and 2022.

Note 25 – Income taxes
JPMorganChase and its eligible subsidiaries file a 
consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. 
JPMorganChase uses the asset and liability method to 
provide for income taxes on all transactions recorded 
in the Consolidated Financial Statements. This method 
requires that income taxes reflect the expected future 
tax consequences of temporary differences between 
the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book 
and tax purposes. Accordingly, a deferred tax asset or 
liability for each temporary difference is determined 
based on the tax rates that the Firm expects to be in 
effect when the underlying items of income and 
expense are realized. JPMorganChase’s expense for 
income taxes includes the current and deferred 
portions of that expense. A valuation allowance is 
established to reduce deferred tax assets to the 
amount the Firm expects to realize. 
Due to the inherent complexities arising from the 
nature of the Firm’s businesses, and from conducting 
business and being taxed in a substantial number of 
jurisdictions, significant judgments and estimates are 
required to be made. Agreement of tax liabilities 
between JPMorganChase and the many tax 
jurisdictions in which the Firm files tax returns may not 
be finalized for several years. Thus, the Firm’s final taxrelated assets and liabilities may ultimately be 
different from those currently reported.
Effective January 1, 2024, the Firm adopted updates to 
the Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit 
Structures Using the Proportional Amortization 
Method guidance, under the modified retrospective 
method. Refer to Notes 1, 6 and 14 for additional 
information.

Tax effect of items recorded in stockholders’ equity
The preceding table does not reflect the tax effect of 
certain items that are recorded each period directly in 
stockholders’ equity, which are predominantly 
reflected in OCI as disclosed in Note 24. For the year 
ended December 31, 2024, stockholders’ equity 
reflected the tax effect associated with the Firm’s 
adoption of the Accounting for Investments in Tax 
Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization 
Method guidance. For the year ended December 31, 
2023, stockholders’ equity reflected the tax effect 
associated with the Firm’s adoption of the TDR 
accounting guidance. Both of the respective adoptions 
were recognized in retained earnings. Refer to Note 1, 
6 and 14 for further information.

Deferred taxes 
Deferred income tax expense/(benefit) reflects the 
differences between assets and liabilities measured 
for financial reporting purposes versus income tax 
return purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, 
in management’s judgment, their realizability is 
determined to be more likely than not. If a deferred tax 
asset is determined to be unrealizable, a valuation 
allowance is established. The significant components 
of deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected in the 
following table, the net deferred tax assets are 
reflected in other assets on the Firm’s Consolidated 
balance sheets.

JPMorganChase has recorded deferred tax assets of 
$352 million at December 31, 2024 in connection with 
tax attribute carryforwards. State and local capital loss 
carryforwards were $914 million, U.S. federal NOL 
carryforwards were $496 million, non-U.S. NOL 
carryforwards were $958 million, and other U.S. federal 
tax attributes were $111 million. If not utilized, a portion 
of the U.S. federal NOL carryforwards and other U.S. 
federal tax attributes will expire between 2026 and 
2036 whereas others have an unlimited carryforward 
period. Similarly, certain non-U.S. NOL carryforwards 
will expire between 2026 and 2041 whereas others 
have an unlimited carryforward period. The state and 
local capital loss carryforwards will expire in 2026. 
The valuation allowance at December 31, 2024, was 
predominantly driven by certain non-U.S. deferred tax 
assets, including NOL carryforwards.

Unrecognized tax benefits
At December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, 
JPMorganChase’s unrecognized tax benefits, 
excluding related interest expense and penalties, were 
$6.2 billion, $5.4 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively, of 
which $4.4 billion, $3.9 billion and $3.8 billion, 
respectively, if recognized, would reduce the annual 
effective tax rate. Included in the amount of 
unrecognized tax benefits are certain items that would 
not affect the effective tax rate if they were recognized 
in the Consolidated statements of income. These 
unrecognized items include the tax effect of certain 
temporary differences, the portion of gross state and 
local unrecognized tax benefits that would be offset by 
the benefit from associated U.S. federal income tax 
deductions, and the portion of gross non-U.S. 
unrecognized tax benefits that would have offsets in 
other jurisdictions. JPMorganChase evaluates the 
need for changes in unrecognized tax benefits based 
on its anticipated tax return filing positions as part of 
its U.S. federal and state and local tax returns. In 
addition, the Firm is presently under audit by a number 
of taxing authorities, most notably by the Internal 
Revenue Service, as summarized in the Tax 
examination status table below. The evaluation of 
unrecognized tax benefits as well as the potential for 
audit settlements make it reasonably possible that 
over the next 12 months the gross balance of 
unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease 
by as much as approximately $2.4 billion. The change 
in the unrecognized tax benefit would result in a 
payment or income statement recognition. 
The following table presents a reconciliation of the 
beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax 
benefits.

At December 31, 2024 and 2023, in addition to the 
liability for unrecognized tax benefits, the Firm had 
accrued $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, for 
income tax-related interest and penalties.

Note 26 – Restricted cash, other restricted 
assets and intercompany funds transfers 
Restricted cash and other restricted assets 
Certain of the Firm’s cash and other assets are restricted 
as to withdrawal or usage. These restrictions are 
imposed by various regulatory authorities based on the 
particular activities of the Firm’s subsidiaries. 
The business of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to 
examination and regulation by the OCC. The Bank is a 
member of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, and its 
deposits in the U.S. are insured by the FDIC, subject to 
applicable limits. 
The Firm is required to maintain cash reserves at 
certain non-US central banks. 
The Firm is also subject to rules and regulations 
established by other U.S. and non U.S. regulators. As 
part of its compliance with the respective regulatory 
requirements, the Firm’s broker-dealer activities are 
subject to certain restrictions on cash and other assets. 
The following table presents the components of the 
Firm’s restricted cash:

and $1.4 billion and $1.4 billion in cash and due from banks on the 
Consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
respectively.
Also, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Firm had 
the following other restricted assets: 
• Cash and securities pledged with clearing 
organizations for the benefit of customers of $40.7 
billion and $40.5 billion, respectively. 
• Securities with a fair value of $26.8 billion and $20.5 
billion, respectively, were also restricted in relation to 
customer activity.
Intercompany funds transfers 
Restrictions imposed by U.S. federal law prohibit 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and its subsidiaries, from 
lending to JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“Parent Company”) 
and certain of its affiliates unless the loans are secured 
in specified amounts. Such secured loans provided by 
any banking subsidiary to the Parent Company or to any 
particular affiliate, together with certain other 
transactions with such affiliate (collectively referred to 
as “covered transactions”), must be made on terms and 
conditions that are consistent with safe and sound 
banking practices. In addition, unless collateralized with 
cash or US Government debt obligations, covered 
transactions are generally limited to 10% of the banking 
subsidiary’s total capital, as determined by the riskbased capital guidelines; the aggregate amount of 
covered transactions between any banking subsidiary 
and all of its affiliates is limited to 20% of the banking 
subsidiary’s total capital.
The Parent Company’s two principal subsidiaries are 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase 
Holdings LLC, an intermediate holding company (the 
“IHC”). The IHC generally holds the stock of 
JPMorganChase’s subsidiaries other than JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The IHC also owns 
other assets and provides intercompany loans to the 
Parent Company. The Parent Company is obligated to 
contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds 
received from securities issuances (including issuances 
of senior and subordinated debt securities and of 
preferred and common stock).
The principal sources of income and funding for the 
Parent Company are dividends from JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A. and dividends and extensions of credit from 
the IHC. In addition to dividend restrictions set forth in 
statutes and regulations, the Federal Reserve, the OCC 
and the FDIC have authority under the Financial 
Institutions Supervisory Act to prohibit or to limit the 
payment of dividends by the banking organizations they 
supervise, including the Parent Company and its 
subsidiaries that are banks or bank holding companies, 
if, in the banking regulator’s opinion, payment of a 
dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound 
practice in light of the financial condition of the banking 
organization. The IHC is prohibited from paying 
dividends or extending credit to the Parent Company if 
certain capital or liquidity “thresholds” are breached or if 
limits are otherwise imposed by the Parent Company’s 
management or Board of Directors.
At January 1, 2025, the Parent Company’s banking 
subsidiaries could pay, in the aggregate, approximately 
$15.5 billion in dividends to their respective bank holding 
companies without the prior approval of their relevant 
banking regulators. The capacity to pay dividends in 
2025 will be supplemented by the banking subsidiaries’ 
earnings during the year.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

Note 27 – Regulatory capital 
The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, 
including well-capitalized standards, for the Firm as a 
consolidated financial holding company. The OCC 
establishes similar minimum capital requirements and 
standards for the Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary, 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 
The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum 
capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards 
for large and internationally active U.S. bank holding 
companies and banks, including the Firm and 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Under the rules currently 
in effect, two comprehensive approaches are 
prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized 
approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced 
approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of these riskbased capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm 
and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is evaluated against 
the lower of the Standardized or Advanced 
approaches compared to their respective regulatory 
capital ratio requirements.
The three components of regulatory capital under the 
Basel III rules and their primary drivers are as 
illustrated below:
Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based 
guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase & 
Co. is required to maintain minimum ratios for CET1 
capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and 
the SLR. Failure to meet these minimum requirements 
could cause the Federal Reserve to take action. 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is also subject to these 
capital requirements established by its primary 
regulators. 
The following table presents the risk-based regulatory 
capital ratio requirements and well-capitalized ratios 
to which the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 
were subject as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

(a) Represents the regulatory capital ratio requirements applicable 
to the Firm. The CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratio requirements 
each include a respective minimum requirement plus a GSIB 
surcharge of 4.5% as calculated under Method 2; plus a 3.3% 
SCB for Basel III Standardized ratios and a fixed 2.5% capital 
conservation buffer for Basel III Advanced ratios. The 
countercyclical buffer is currently set to 0% by the federal 
banking agencies.
(b) For the period ended December 31, 2023, the CET1, Tier 1, and 
Total capital ratio requirements under Basel III Standardized 
applicable to the Firm were 11.4%, 12.9%, and 14.9%, respectively; 
the Basel III Advanced CET1, Tier 1, and Total capital ratio 
requirements applicable to the Firm were 11.0%, 12.5%, and 
14.5%, respectively.
(c) Represents requirements for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The 
CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratio requirements include a fixed 
capital conservation buffer requirement of 2.5% that is 
applicable to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
N.A. is not subject to the GSIB surcharge.

CECL Regulatory Capital Transition
Beginning January 1, 2022, the $2.9 billion CECL 
capital benefit, provided by the Federal Reserve in 
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, is being phased 
out at 25% per year over a three-year period. As of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Firm’s CET1 capital 
reflected the remaining benefit of $720 million and 
$1.4 billion, respectively, associated with the CECL 
capital transition provisions. 
Similarly, as of January 1, 2024, the Firm has phased 
out 75% of the other CECL capital transition provisions 
which impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted average 
assets, total leverage exposure and RWA, as 
applicable.
The following tables present risk-based capital metrics under both the Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced 
approaches and leverage-based capital metrics for JPMorgan Chase & Co. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. As of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were well-capitalized and 
met all capital requirements to which each was subject.

Note 28 – Off–balance sheet lending-related 
financial instruments, guarantees, and 
other commitments
JPMorganChase provides lending-related financial 
instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to 
address the financing needs of its customers and 
clients. The contractual amount of these financial 
instruments represents the maximum possible credit 
risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw 
upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill 
its obligation under the guarantee, and should the 
customer or client subsequently fail to perform 
according to the terms of the contract. Most of these 
commitments and guarantees have historically been 
refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without 
being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the 
total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in 
the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future 
credit exposure or funding requirements. 
To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and 
certain consumer lending-related commitments, an 
allowance for credit losses on lending-related 
commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 13 for 
further information regarding the allowance for credit 
losses on lending-related commitments.
The following table summarizes the contractual 
amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet 
lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and 
other commitments at December 31, 2024 and 2023. 
The amounts in the table below for credit card, home 
equity and certain scored business banking lendingrelated commitments represent the total available 
credit for these products. The Firm has not 
experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available 
lines of credit for these commitments will be utilized at 
the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel these 
commitments, in accordance with the contract, or to 
the extent otherwise permitted by law, including when 
there has been a demonstrable decline in the 
creditworthiness of the borrower or significant 
decrease in the value of underlying property.

Other unfunded commitments to extend credit 
Other unfunded commitments to extend credit 
generally consist of commitments for working capital 
and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit 
to support commercial paper facilities and bond 
financings in the event that those obligations cannot 
be remarketed to new investors, as well as committed 
liquidity facilities to clearing organizations. The Firm 
also issues commitments under multipurpose facilities 
which could be drawn upon in several forms, including 
the issuance of a standby letter of credit. 
Guarantees 
U.S. GAAP requires that a guarantor recognize, at the 
inception of a guarantee, a liability in an amount equal 
to the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing 
the guarantee. U.S. GAAP defines a guarantee as a 
contract that contingently requires the guarantor to 
pay the guaranteed party based upon: (a) changes in 
an underlying asset, liability or equity security of the 
guaranteed party; or (b) a third party’s failure to 
perform under a specified agreement. The Firm 
considers the following off–balance sheet 
arrangements to be guarantees under U.S. GAAP: 
standby letters of credit and other financial 
guarantees, securities lending indemnifications, 
certain indemnification agreements included within 
third-party contractual arrangements, certain 
derivative contracts and the guarantees under the 
sponsored member repo program. 
As required by U.S. GAAP, the Firm initially records 
guarantees at the inception date fair value of the noncontingent obligation assumed (e.g., the amount of 
consideration received or the net present value of the 
premium receivable). For these obligations, the Firm 
records this fair value amount in other liabilities with an 
offsetting entry recorded in cash (for premiums 
received), or other assets (for premiums receivable). 
Any premium receivable recorded in other assets is 
reduced as cash is received under the contract, and 
the fair value of the liability recorded at inception is 
amortized into income as lending and deposit-related 
fees over the life of the guarantee contract. The 
lending-related contingent obligation is recognized 
based on expected credit losses in addition to, and 
separate from, any non-contingent obligation.
Non-lending-related contingent obligations are 
recognized when the liability becomes probable and 
reasonably estimable. These obligations are not 
recognized if the estimated amount is less than the 
carrying amount of any non-contingent liability 
recognized at inception (adjusted for any 
amortization). Examples of non-lending-related 
contingent obligations include indemnifications 
provided in sales agreements, where a portion of the 
sale proceeds is allocated to the guarantee, which 
adjusts the gain or loss that would otherwise result 
from the transaction. For these indemnifications, the 
initial liability is amortized to income as the Firm’s risk 
is reduced (i.e., over time or when the indemnification 
expires).
The contractual amount and carrying value of 
guarantees and indemnifications are included in the 
table on page 303.
For additional information on the guarantees, see 
below. 
Standby letters of credit and other financial 
guarantees 
Standby letters of credit and other financial 
guarantees are conditional lending commitments 
issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a 
client or customer to a third party under certain 
arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, 
bond financings, acquisition financings, trade 
financings and similar transactions. 
The following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other 
financial guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Securities lending indemnifications 
Through the Firm’s securities lending program, 
counterparties’ securities, via custodial and noncustodial arrangements, may be lent to third parties. 
As part of this program, the Firm provides an 
indemnification in the lending agreements which 
protects the lender against the failure of the borrower 
to return the lent securities. To minimize its liability 
under these indemnification agreements, the Firm 
obtains cash or other highly liquid collateral with a 
market value exceeding 100% of the value of the 
securities on loan from the borrower. Collateral is 
marked to market daily to help assure that 
collateralization is adequate. Additional collateral is 
called from the borrower if a shortfall exists, or 
collateral may be released to the borrower in the event 
of overcollateralization. If a borrower defaults, the Firm 
would use the collateral held to purchase replacement 
securities in the market or to credit the lending client 
or counterparty with the cash equivalent thereof. 
The cash collateral held by the Firm may be invested 
on behalf of the client in indemnified resale 
agreements, whereby the Firm indemnifies the client 
against the loss of principal invested. To minimize its 
liability under these agreements, the Firm obtains 
collateral with a market value exceeding 100% of the 
principal invested.
Derivatives qualifying as guarantees 
The Firm transacts in certain derivative contracts that 
have the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. 
GAAP. These contracts include written put options 
that require the Firm to purchase assets upon exercise 
by the option holder at a specified price by a specified 
date in the future. The Firm may enter into written put 
option contracts in order to meet client needs, or for 
other trading purposes. The terms of written put 
options are typically five years or less. 
Derivatives deemed to be guarantees also includes 
stable value contracts, commonly referred to as 
“stable value products”, that require the Firm to make 
a payment of the difference between the market value 
and the book value of a counterparty’s reference 
portfolio of assets in the event that market value is less 
than book value and certain other conditions have 
been met. Stable value products are transacted in 
order to allow investors to realize investment returns 
with less volatility than an unprotected portfolio. These 
contracts are typically longer-term or may have no 
stated maturity, but allow the Firm to elect to 
terminate the contract under certain conditions. 
The notional value of derivative guarantees generally 
represents the Firm’s maximum exposure. However, 
exposure to certain stable value products is 
contractually limited to a substantially lower 
percentage of the notional amount. 
The fair value of derivative guarantees reflects the 
probability, in the Firm’s view, of whether the Firm will 
be required to perform under the contract. The Firm 
reduces exposures to these contracts by entering into 
offsetting transactions, or by entering into contracts 
that hedge the market risk related to the derivative 
guarantees. 
The following table summarizes the derivatives 
qualifying as guarantees as of December 31, 2024 and 
2023.

In addition to derivative contracts that meet the 
characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a 
purchaser and seller of credit protection in the credit 
derivatives market. Refer to Note 5 for a further 
discussion of credit derivatives. 
Unsettled securities financing agreements 
In the normal course of business, the Firm enters into 
resale and securities borrowed agreements. At 
settlement, these commitments result in the Firm 
advancing cash to and receiving securities collateral 
from the counterparty. The Firm also enters into 
repurchase and securities loaned agreements. At 
settlement, these commitments result in the Firm 
receiving cash from and providing securities collateral 
to the counterparty. Such agreements settle at a future 
date. These agreements generally do not meet the 
definition of a derivative, and therefore, are not 
recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets until 
settlement date. These agreements predominantly 
have regular-way settlement terms. Refer to Note 11 for 
a further discussion of securities financing 
agreements. 
Loan sales- and securitization-related 
indemnifications 
Mortgage repurchase liability 
In connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and 
securitization activities with U.S. GSEs the Firm has 
made representations and warranties that the loans 
sold meet certain requirements, and that may require 
the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or 
indemnify the loan purchaser if such representations 
and warranties are breached by the Firm. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

Private label securitizations
The liability related to repurchase demands associated 
with private label securitizations is separately 
evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation 
reserves. 
Refer to Note 30 for additional information regarding 
litigation. 
Loans sold with recourse 
The Firm provides servicing for mortgages and certain 
commercial lending products on both a recourse and 
nonrecourse basis. In nonrecourse servicing, the 
principal credit risk to the Firm is the cost of temporary 
servicing advances of funds (i.e., normal servicing 
advances). In recourse servicing, the servicer agrees 
to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage 
loans, such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or a private 
investor, insurer or guarantor. Losses on recourse 
servicing predominantly occur when foreclosure sales 
proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted loan 
are less than the sum of the outstanding principal 
balance, plus accrued interest on the loan and the cost 
of holding and disposing of the underlying property. 
The Firm’s securitizations are predominantly 
nonrecourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk 
of future credit losses to the purchaser of the 
mortgage-backed securities issued by the trust. The 
unpaid principal balance of loans sold with recourse as 
well as the carrying value of the related liability that the 
Firm has recorded in accounts payable and other 
liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, which is 
representative of the Firm’s view of the likelihood it will 
have to perform under its recourse obligations, are 
disclosed in the table on page 303.
Other off-balance sheet arrangements 
Indemnification agreements – general 
In connection with issuing securities to investors 
outside the U.S., the Firm may agree to pay additional 
amounts to the holders of the securities in the event 
that, due to a change in tax law, certain types of 
withholding taxes are imposed on payments on the 
securities. The terms of the securities may also give 
the Firm the right to redeem the securities if such 
additional amounts are payable. The Firm may also 
enter into indemnification clauses such as in 
connection with the licensing of software to clients 
(“software licensees”) or when it sells a business or 
assets to a third party (“third-party purchasers”), 
pursuant to which it indemnifies software licensees for 
claims of liability or damages that may occur 
subsequent to the licensing of the software, or thirdparty purchasers for losses they may incur due to 
actions taken by the Firm prior to the sale of the 
business or assets. It is difficult to estimate the Firm’s 
maximum exposure under these indemnification 
arrangements, since this would require an assessment 
of future changes in tax law and future claims that may 
be made against the Firm that have not yet occurred. 
However, based on historical experience, 
management expects the risk of loss to be remote. 
Merchant charge-backs 
Under the rules of payment networks, in its role as a 
merchant acquirer, the Firm’s Merchant Services 
business in CIB Payments, retains a contingent liability 
for disputed processed credit and debit card 
transactions that result in a charge-back to the 
merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholder’s 
favor, the Firm will (through the cardholder’s issuing 
bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder 
and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If 
the Firm is unable to collect the amount from the 
merchant, the Firm will bear the loss for the amount 
credited or refunded to the cardholder. The Firm 
mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, 
retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other 
collateral. In addition, the Firm recognizes a valuation 
allowance that covers the payment or performance 
risk related to charge-backs. 
Clearing Services – Client Credit Risk 
The Firm provides clearing services for clients by 
entering into securities purchases and sales and 
derivative contracts with CCPs, including ETDs such as 
futures and options, as well as OTC-cleared derivative 
contracts. As a clearing member, the Firm stands 
behind the performance of its clients, collects cash 
and securities collateral (margin) as well as any 
settlement amounts due from or to clients, and remits 
them to the relevant CCP or client in whole or part. 
There are two types of margin: variation margin is 
posted on a daily basis based on the value of clients’ 
derivative contracts and initial margin is posted at 
inception of a derivative contract, generally on the 
basis of the potential changes in the variation margin 
requirement for the contract. 
As a clearing member, the Firm is exposed to the risk 
of nonperformance by its clients, but is not liable to 
clients for the performance of the CCPs. Where 
possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its risk to the client 
through the collection of appropriate amounts of 
margin at inception and throughout the life of the 
transactions. The Firm can also cease providing 
clearing services if clients do not adhere to their 
obligations under the clearing agreement. In the event 
of nonperformance by a client, the Firm would close 
out the client’s positions and access available margin. 
The CCP would utilize any margin it holds to make 
itself whole, with any remaining shortfalls required to 
be paid by the Firm as a clearing member. 
Notes to consolidated financial statements

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

The Firm reflects its exposure to nonperformance risk 
of the client through the recognition of margin 
receivables from clients and margin payables to CCPs; 
the clients’ underlying securities or derivative 
contracts are not reflected in the Firm’s Consolidated 
Financial Statements. 
It is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum possible 
exposure through its role as a clearing member, as this 
would require an assessment of transactions that 
clients may execute in the future. However, based 
upon historical experience, and the credit risk 
mitigants available to the Firm, management believes 
it is unlikely that the Firm will have to make any 
material payments under these arrangements and the 
risk of loss is expected to be remote. 
Refer to Note 5 for information on the derivatives that 
the Firm executes for its own account and records in 
its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Exchange & Clearing House Memberships 
The Firm is a member of several securities and 
derivative exchanges and clearing houses, both in the 
U.S. and other countries, and it provides clearing 
services to its clients. Membership in some of these 
organizations requires the Firm to pay a pro rata share 
of the losses incurred by the organization as a result of 
the default of another member. Such obligations vary 
with different organizations. These obligations may be 
limited to the amount (or a multiple of the amount) of 
the Firm’s contribution to the guarantee fund 
maintained by a clearing house or exchange as part of 
the resources available to cover any losses in the event 
of a member default. Alternatively, these obligations 
may also include a pro rata share of the residual losses 
after applying the guarantee fund. Additionally, certain 
clearing houses require the Firm as a member to pay a 
pro rata share of losses that may result from the 
clearing house’s investment of guarantee fund 
contributions and initial margin, unrelated to and 
independent of the default of another 
member. Generally a payment would only be required 
should such losses exceed the resources of the 
clearing house or exchange that are contractually 
required to absorb the losses in the first instance. In 
certain cases, it is difficult to estimate the Firm’s 
maximum possible exposure under these membership 
agreements, since this would require an assessment of 
future claims that may be made against the Firm that 
have not yet occurred. However, based on historical 
experience, management expects the risk of loss to 
the Firm to be remote. Where the Firm’s maximum 
possible exposure can be estimated, the amount is 
disclosed in the table on page 303, in the Exchange & 
clearing house guarantees and commitments line. 
Sponsored member repo program 
The Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible 
overnight and term resale and repurchase agreements 
through the Government Securities Division of the 
Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf 
of clients that become sponsored members under the 
FICC’s rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the 
prompt and full payment and performance of its 
sponsored member clients’ respective obligations 
under the FICC’s rules. The Firm minimizes its liability 
under these guarantees by obtaining a security 
interest in the cash or high-quality securities collateral 
that the clients place with the clearing house; 
therefore, the Firm expects the risk of loss to be 
remote. The Firm’s maximum possible exposure, 
without taking into consideration the associated 
collateral, is included in the Exchange & clearing house 
guarantees and commitments line on page 303. Refer 
to Note 11 for additional information on credit risk 
mitigation practices on resale agreements and the 
types of collateral pledged under repurchase 
agreements. 
Guarantees of subsidiaries 
In the normal course of business, the Parent Company 
may provide counterparties with guarantees of certain 
of the trading and other obligations of its subsidiaries 
on a contract-by-contract basis, as negotiated with the 
Firm’s counterparties. The obligations of the 
subsidiaries are included on the Firm’s Consolidated 
balance sheets or are reflected as off-balance sheet 
commitments; therefore, the Parent Company has not 
recognized a separate liability for these guarantees. 
The Firm believes that the occurrence of any event 
that would trigger payments by the Parent Company 
under these guarantees is remote. 
The Parent Company has guaranteed certain longterm debt and structured notes of its subsidiaries, 
including JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC 
(“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned finance subsidiary. All 
securities issued by JPMFC are fully and 
unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company 
and no other subsidiary of the Parent Company 
guarantees these securities. These guarantees, which 
rank pari passu with the Firm’s unsecured and 
unsubordinated indebtedness, are not included in the 
table on page 303 of this Note. Refer to Note 20 for 
additional information.

Note 29 – Pledged assets and collateral 
Pledged assets 
The Firm pledges financial assets that it owns to 
maintain potential borrowing capacity at discount 
windows with Federal Reserve banks, various other 
central banks and FHLBs. Additionally, the Firm 
pledges assets for other purposes, including to 
collateralize repurchase and other securities financing 
agreements, to cover short sales and to collateralize 
derivative contracts and deposits. Certain of these 
pledged assets may be sold or repledged or otherwise 
used by the secured parties and are parenthetically 
identified on the Consolidated balance sheets as 
assets pledged.

Note 30 – Litigation
Contingencies 
As of December 31, 2024, the Firm and its subsidiaries 
and affiliates are defendants or respondents in 
numerous evolving legal proceedings, including private 
proceedings, public proceedings, government 
investigations, regulatory enforcement matters, and the 
matters described below. The litigations range from 
individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class 
action lawsuits with potentially millions of class 
members. Investigations and regulatory enforcement 
matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, 
by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory 
organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying 
stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and 
involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and several 
geographies and a wide variety of claims (including 
common law tort and contract claims and statutory 
antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), 
some of which present novel legal theories.
The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range 
of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves 
established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to 
approximately $1.4 billion at December 31, 2024. This 
estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible 
losses was based upon information available as of that 
date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes 
that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be 
made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe 
that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The 
Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably 
possible losses involves significant judgment, given:
• the number, variety and varying stages of the 
proceedings, including the fact that many are in 
preliminary stages, 
• the existence in many such proceedings of multiple 
defendants, including the Firm, whose share of 
liability (if any) has yet to be determined, 
• the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the 
proceedings, including issues regarding class 
certification and the scope of many of the claims, and 
• the uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of 
such proceedings, including where the Firm has made 
assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or 
other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives 
of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those 
assumptions prove to be incorrect.
In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may 
be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its 
estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of 
that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s 
estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible 
losses will change from time to time, and actual losses 
may vary significantly.
Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material 
legal proceedings.
1MDB Litigation. J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as 
a defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in 
Malaysia by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (“1MDB”), a 
Malaysian state-owned and controlled investment fund. 
The claim alleges “dishonest assistance” against J.P. 
Morgan (Suisse) SA in relation to payments of 
$300 million and $500 million, from 2009 and 2010, 
respectively, received from 1MDB and paid into an 
account at J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA held by 1MDB 
PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company between 
1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman) Limited. In 
March 2024, the Court upheld the Firm's challenge to 
the validity of service and the Malaysian Court’s 
jurisdiction to hear the claim. That decision has been 
appealed by 1MDB. In August 2023, the Court denied an 
application by 1MDB to discontinue its claim with 
permission to re-file a new claim in the future. That 
decision was appealed by both 1MDB and the Firm, and 
an appeals court is scheduled to hear both appeals in 
November 2025. In its appeal, the Firm seeks to prevent 
any claim from continuing. 
In addition, in November 2023, the Federal Office of the 
Attorney General (OAG) in Switzerland notified J.P. 
Morgan (Suisse) SA that it is conducting an 
investigation into possible criminal liability in 
connection with transactions arising from J.P. Morgan 
(Suisse) SA’s relationship with the 1MDB PetroSaudi 
joint venture and its related persons for the period 
September 2009 through August 2015. The OAG 
investigation is ongoing. 
Amrapali. India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is 
investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in 
connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by 
two offshore funds formerly managed by 
JPMorganChase entities into residential housing 
projects developed by the Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”) 
relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver 
residential units. In August 2021, the ED issued an order 
fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately 
$31.5 million, and the Firm is appealing that order. 
Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India 
issued an order making preliminary findings that 
Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified 
JPMorganChase entities and the offshore funds that had 
invested in the projects, violated certain criminal 
currency control and money laundering provisions, and 
ordered the ED to conduct a further inquiry. The Firm is 
responding to and cooperating with the inquiry. 
Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The 
Firm previously reported settlements with certain 
government authorities relating to its foreign exchange 
(“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to 
those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, 
the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal 
antitrust law. The Department of Labor ("DOL") granted 
the Firm exemptions that permit the Firm and its 
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional 
Asset Manager exemption under the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) through the 
ten-year disqualification period following the antitrust 
plea. The only remaining FX-related governmental 
inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission 
matter which is currently pending before the South 
Africa Competition Tribunal.
With respect to civil litigation matters, some FX-related 
individual and putative class actions filed outside the 
U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil 
and Australia, remain. In July 2023, the U.K. Court of 
Appeal overturned the Competition Appeal Tribunal's 
earlier denial of a request for class certification on an 
opt-out basis. The defendants have appealed this 
decision to the U.K. Supreme Court. In Israel, a 
settlement in principle has been reached on the 
putative class action, which remains subject to court 
approval. 
Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail 
associations filed a series of class action complaints 
alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain 
banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit 
card interchange fees and enacted related rules in 
violation of antitrust laws.
In September 2018, the parties settled the class action 
seeking monetary relief, with the defendants collectively 
contributing approximately $6.2 billion. The settlement 
has been approved by the United States District Court 
for the Eastern District of New York and affirmed on 
appeal. Based on the percentage of merchants that 
opted out of the settlement, $700 million has been 
returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow. 
A separate class action seeking injunctive relief 
continues, and in September 2021, the District Court 
granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in part, 
and denied the motion in part. In June 2024, the District 
Court denied preliminary approval of a settlement of the 
injunctive class action in which Visa and Mastercard 
agreed to certain changes to their respective network 
rules and system-wide reductions in interchange rates 
for U.S.-based merchants. The parties are considering 
next steps. 
Of the merchants who opted out of the damages class 
settlement, certain merchants filed individual actions 
raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, 
as well as against the Firm and other banks. While some 
of those actions remain pending, the defendants have 
reached settlements with the merchants who opted out 
representing over 70% of the combined Mastercardbranded and Visa-branded payment card sales volume. 
LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and 
Litigation. JPMorganChase has responded to inquiries 
from various governmental agencies and entities 
around the world relating primarily to the British 
Bankers Association’s (“BBA”) London Interbank 
Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies and the 
European Banking Federation’s Euro Interbank Offered 
Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss Competition 
Commission’s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to 
which the Firm and one other bank remain subject, 
continues. The Firm appealed a December 2016 
decision by the European Commission against the Firm 
and other banks finding an infringement of European 
antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. In December 2023, 
the European General Court annulled the fine imposed 
by the European Commission, but exercised its 
discretion to re-impose a fine in an identical amount. In 
March 2024, the Firm filed an appeal of this decision 
with the Court of Justice of the European Union.
In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant 
along with other banks in various individual and putative 
class actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. 
dollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR 
during the period that it was administered by the BBA, 
the United States District Court for the Southern District 
of New York granted class certification of antitrust 
claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold 
directly by the defendants, including the Firm. The Firm 
has obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved 
certain other actions, and as to all remaining actions has 
moved for summary judgment. In addition, a lawsuit 
filed by a group of individual plaintiffs asserting antitrust 
claims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants 
were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. 
dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market 
for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards was 
dismissed in October 2023 and affirmed on appeal by 
the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit 
in December 2024. The Firm has resolved all non-U.S. 
dollar LIBOR actions.
Russian Litigation. The Firm is obligated to comply with 
international sanctions laws, which mandate the 
blocking of certain assets. These laws apply when 
assets associated with individuals, companies, products 
or services are within the scope of the sanctions. The 
Firm has faced actual and threatened litigation in Russia 
seeking payments that the Firm cannot make under, 
and is contractually excused from paying as a result of, 
relevant sanctions laws. In claims involving the Firm and 
claims filed against other financial institutions, Russian 
courts have disregarded the parties’ contractual 
agreements concerning forum selection and did not 
recognize foreign sanctions laws as a basis for not 
making payment. Russian courts have entered 
judgment against the Firm in a number of claims, 
including one for $439 million, and a judgment has been 
executed against assets held onshore by the Firm in 
Russia. The total amount of the judgments exceeds the 
total amount of available assets that the Firm holds in 
Russia. The Firm continues to appeal the Russian 
courts' decisions, and judgments may not be executed 
while on appeal. Russian courts have also ordered 
interim freezes of Firm assets in Russia (including, 
among other things, funds in bank accounts, securities, 
shares in authorized capital, and certain trademarks, of 
the named defendants) pending a determination of 
Notes to consolidated financial statements

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

certain underlying claims against the Firm. The Firm has 
challenged claims being pursued in the Russian courts 
and related freeze orders in other jurisdictions provided 
for by the parties’ contractual forum selections. If further 
claims are enforced despite the actions taken by the 
Firm to challenge the claims and orders and to seek the 
proper application of law, the Firm’s assets in Russia 
could be seized in full, and certain client assets could 
also be seized, or the Firm could be prevented from 
complying with its obligations.
SEC Inquiries. In October 2024, the Firm entered into 
settlements with the SEC to resolve inquiries related to, 
among other things, conflict disclosures concerning the 
selection of portfolio managers and the timing of the 
Firm’s liquidation of shares distributed in-kind to certain 
investment vehicles that invest in third-party managed 
private funds and certain other matters. The resolutions 
required the Firm to pay a combined $151 million in civil 
penalties and voluntary payments to customers. The 
Firm continues to cooperate in connection with SEC 
inquiries concerning the aggregation of accounts for fee 
billing and various other matters.
Shareholder Litigation. Several shareholder putative 
class actions, as well as shareholder derivative actions 
purporting to act on behalf of the Firm, have been filed 
against the Firm, its Board of Directors and certain of its 
current and former officers. 
Certain of these shareholder suits relate to historical 
trading practices by former employees in the precious 
metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct 
which were the subject of the Firm’s resolutions with the 
DOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020, and fiduciary 
activities that were separately the subject of a resolution 
between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in 
November 2020. One of these shareholder derivative 
suits was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New 
York in May 2022, asserting breach of fiduciary duty 
and unjust enrichment claims relating to the historical 
trading practices and related conduct and fiduciary 
activities which were the subject of the resolutions 
described above. In December 2022, the court granted 
defendants’ motion to dismiss this action in full, and in 
July 2023, the plaintiff filed an appeal, which remains 
pending. 
A second shareholder derivative action relating to the 
historical trading practices and related conduct was 
filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern 
District of New York in December 2022. Defendants 
have moved to dismiss the complaint.
Zelle Network Litigation. In December 2024, the 
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) filed a 
complaint against Early Warning Services, LLC (“EWS”), 
Bank of America, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in the United States District 
Court for the District of Arizona. The CFPB alleges that 
EWS and the defendant banks have failed to take 
sufficient efforts to prevent fraud on the Zelle network. 
The defendants will file a response to the complaint.
* * *
In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed 
above, JPMorganChase and its subsidiaries are named 
as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial 
number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it 
has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against 
it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it 
intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal 
proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the 
future.
The Firm has established reserves for several hundred 
of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In 
accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for 
contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related 
liability when it is probable that such a liability has been 
incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably 
estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal 
proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation 
reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, 
upward or downward, as appropriate, based on 
management’s best judgment after consultation with 
counsel. The Firm’s legal expense was $740 million, 
$1.4 billion and $266 million for the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. There 
is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will 
not need to be adjusted in the future. 
In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the 
outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the 
claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or 
where the matters present novel legal theories, involve 
a large number of parties or are in early stages of 
discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what 
will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending 
matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the 
eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences 
related to those matters. JPMorganChase believes, 
based upon its current knowledge and after 
consultation with counsel, consideration of the material 
legal proceedings described above and after taking into 
account its current litigation reserves and its estimated 
aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal 
proceedings currently pending against it should not 
have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s 
consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, 
however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in 
such proceedings, there is no assurance that the 
ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly 
exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a 
matter will not have material reputational 
consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular 
matter may be material to JPMorganChase’s operating 
results for a particular period, depending on, among 
other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and 
the level of JPMorganChase’s income for that period.
JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

Note 31 – International operations 
The following table presents income statement and 
balance sheet-related information for JPMorganChase 
by major international geographic area. The Firm 
defines international activities for purposes of this 
footnote presentation as business transactions that 
involve clients residing outside of the U.S., and the 
information presented below is based predominantly 
on the domicile of the client, the location from which 
the client relationship is managed, booking location or 
the location of the trading desk. However, many of the 
Firm’s U.S. operations serve international businesses.
As the Firm’s operations are highly integrated, 
estimates and subjective assumptions have been 
made to apportion revenue and expense between U.S. 
and international operations. These estimates and 
assumptions are consistent with the allocations used 
for the Firm’s segment reporting as set forth in Note 
32.
The Firm’s long-lived assets for the periods presented 
are not considered by management to be significant in 
relation to total assets. The majority of the Firm’s longlived assets are located in the U.S.

Note 32 – Business segments & Corporate
Business segment reorganization: Effective in the 
second quarter of 2024, the Firm reorganized its 
reportable business segments by combining the former 
Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial Banking 
business segments to form one reportable segment, 
the Commercial & Investment Bank. As a result of the 
reorganization, the Firm has three reportable business 
segments – Consumer & Community Banking, 
Commercial & Investment Bank, and Asset & Wealth 
Management – with the remaining activities in 
Corporate. 
Adoption of accounting standard — Segment 
Reporting — Improvements to Reportable Segment 
Disclosures: This guidance was adopted 
retrospectively for the Firm’s annual Consolidated 
Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 
2024. The adoption of this guidance requires additional 
reportable segment disclosures, primarily relating to 
significant segment expenses and the chief operating 
decision maker (“CODM”). Adoption of this guidance did 
not result in changes to the identification of the Firm’s 
reportable business segments, or of its CODM. 
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. The business 
segments are determined based on the products and 
services provided, or the type of customer served, and 
they reflect the manner in which financial information is 
evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee, whose 
members act collectively as the Firm’s CODM. Segment 
results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to 
Segment & Corporate results in this footnote for a 
further discussion of JPMorganChase’s reportable 
business segments and Corporate.
The following is a description of each of the Firm’s 
reportable business segments, and the products and 
services that they provide to their respective client 
bases, as well as a description of Corporate activities.
Consumer & Community Banking 
Consumer & Community Banking offers products and 
services to consumers and small businesses through 
bank branches, ATMs, digital (including mobile and 
online) and telephone banking. CCB is organized into

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

Description of business segment reporting 
methodology
Results of the reportable business segments are 
intended to present each segment as if it were a standalone business. The management reporting process 
that derives business segment results includes the 
allocation of certain income and expense items. The 
Firm periodically assesses the assumptions, 
methodologies and reporting classifications used for 
segment reporting, and therefore further refinements 
may be implemented in future periods. The Firm also 
assesses the level of capital required for each LOB on 
at least an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide 
various business metrics which are utilized by the Firm 
and its investors and analysts in assessing 
performance. 
Revenue sharing 
When business segments or businesses within each 
segment join efforts to sell products and services to 
the Firm’s clients and customers, the participating 
businesses may agree to share revenue from those 
transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the 
segment responsible for the related product or 
service, with allocations to the other segments or 
businesses involved in the transaction. The segment 
and business results reflect these revenue-sharing 
agreements.
Expense allocation
Where business segments use services provided by 
Corporate support units, or another business segment, 
the costs of those services are allocated to the 
respective business segments. The expense is 
generally allocated based on the actual cost and use of 
services provided. In contrast, certain costs and 
investments related to Corporate that are not currently 
utilized by any LOB are not allocated to the business 
segments and are retained in Corporate. Expense 
retained in Corporate generally includes costs that 
would not be incurred if the segments were standalone businesses, and other items not solely aligned 
with a particular reportable business segment.
Funds transfer pricing 
Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which 
the Firm allocates interest income and expense to the 
LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary 
interest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO.
The funds transfer pricing process considers the 
interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets 
and liabilities and off-balance sheet products. 
Periodically, the methodology and assumptions 
utilized in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect 
economic conditions and other factors, which may 
impact the allocation of net interest income to the 
segments. Effective in the fourth quarter of 2024, the 
Firm updated its FTP with respect to consumer 
deposits, which resulted in an increase in the funding 
benefit reflected within CCB’s net interest income that 
is fully offset in Corporate, with no effect on the Firm’s 
net interest income.
Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs 
and Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain 
revenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages 
these risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign 
exchange rate movements related to the transferred 
risk in its results.
Debt expense and preferred stock dividend allocation
As part of the FTP process, almost all of the cost of the 
credit spread component of outstanding unsecured 
long-term debt and preferred stock dividends is 
allocated to the reportable business segments, while 
the balance of the cost is retained in Corporate. The 
methodology to allocate the cost of unsecured longterm debt and preferred stock dividends to the 
business segments is aligned with the relevant 
regulatory capital requirements and funding needs of 
the LOBs, as applicable. The allocated cost of 
unsecured long-term debt is included in a business 
segment’s net interest income, and net income is 
reduced by preferred stock dividends, to arrive at a 
business segment’s net income applicable to common 
equity.
Capital allocation
Each LOB and Corporate is allocated capital by taking 
into consideration a variety of factors including capital 
levels of similarly rated peers and applicable 
regulatory capital requirements. ROE is measured and 
internal targets for expected returns are established 
as key measures of an LOB’s performance.
The Firm’s current equity allocation methodology 
incorporates Basel III Standardized RWA and the GSIB 
surcharge, both under rules currently in effect, as well 
as a simulation of capital depletion in a severe stress 
environment. At least annually, the assumptions, 
judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital 
are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to 
the LOBs and Corporate may change.

Segment & Corporate results 
The following table provides a summary of results for 
the Firm’s reportable business segments and 
Corporate activities as of or for the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, on a managed 
basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts 
with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes 
certain reclassifications to present total net revenue 
for the Firm as a whole (and for each of the reportable 
business segments and Corporate) on an FTE basis. 
Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive 
tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in 
the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable 
investments and securities. This allows management 
to assess the comparability of revenue from year-toyear arising from both taxable and tax-exempt 
sources. The corresponding income tax impact related 
to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax 
expense/(benefit). These adjustments have no impact 
on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by 
the each of the LOBs and Corporate.
The Operating Committee reviews segment results 
including net interest income, noninterest revenue, 
noninterest expense, provision for credit losses and 
net income on a managed basis. The Operating 
Committee uses these measures to evaluate segment 
performance and to make key operating decisions, 
including resource and capital allocations.

Note 34 – Business combinations
On May 1, 2023, JPMorganChase acquired certain 
assets and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic 
Bank (the "First Republic acquisition") from the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), as receiver. 
The acquisition resulted in a bargain purchase gain, 
which represents the excess of the estimated fair value 
of the net assets acquired above the purchase price. 
The Firm has determined that this acquisition 
constitutes a business combination under U.S. GAAP. 
Accordingly, the initial recognition of the assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed were generally 
measured at their estimated fair values as of May 1, 
2023. The determination of those fair values required 
management to make certain market-based 
assumptions about expected future cash flows, 
discount rates and other valuation inputs at the time of 
the acquisition. The Firm believes that the fair value 
estimates of the assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed provide a reasonable basis for determining 
the estimated bargain purchase gain. 
The First Republic acquisition resulted in a preliminary 
estimated bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion. The 
final bargain purchase gain of $2.9 billion reflects 
adjustments of $103 million and $63 million for the 
years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
respectively, made during the one-year measurement 
period, as permitted by U.S. GAAP, to finalize 
management's fair value estimates for the assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed. As of December 31, 
2024, certain matters related to the final settlement 
remained outstanding between the Firm and the FDIC. 
On January 17, 2025, the Firm reached an agreement 
with the FDIC with respect to certain outstanding 
items. As a result of the agreement, the Firm made a 
payment of $609 million to the FDIC on January 31, 
2025 and reduced its additional payable to the FDIC, 
which will result in a gain of approximately 
$600 million to be recorded in other income in the first 
quarter of 2025.
In connection with the First Republic acquisition, the 
Firm and the FDIC entered into two shared-loss 
agreements with respect to certain loans and lendingrelated commitments (the "shared-loss assets"): the 
Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement ("CSLA") and the 
Single-Family Shared-Loss Agreement (“SFSLA”). The 
CSLA covers 80% of credit losses, on a pari passu 
basis, over 5 years with a subsequent 3-year recovery 
period for certain acquired commercial loans and 
other real estate exposure. The SFSLA covers 80% of 
credit losses, on a pari passu basis, for 7 years for 
certain acquired loans secured by mortgages on real 
property or shares in cooperative property 
constituting a primary residence. The indemnification 
assets, which represent the fair value of the CSLA and 
SFSLA on the acquisition date, are reflected in the total 
assets acquired.
As part of the consideration paid, JPMorganChase 
issued a five-year, $50 billion secured note to the FDIC 
(the "Purchase Money Note"). The Purchase Money 
Note bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.4% and is 
secured by certain of the acquired loans. The Purchase 
Money Note is prepayable upon notice to the holder.
The Firm had placed a $5 billion deposit with First 
Republic Bank on March 16, 2023, as part of $30 billion 
of deposits provided by a consortium of large U.S. 
banks. The Firm's $5 billion deposit was effectively 
settled as part of the acquisition and the associated 
allowance for credit losses was released upon closing. 
The Firm subsequently repaid the remaining $25 
billion of deposits to the consortium of banks, 
including accrued interest through the payment date 
on May 9, 2023.

(b) As part of the consideration paid, JPMorganChase issued a five-year, $50 billion secured note to the FDIC (the "Purchase Money Note").
(c) Includes $447 million of securities financing transactions with First Republic Bank that were effectively settled on the acquisition date.
(d) Other assets include $1.2 billion in tax-oriented investments and $683 million of lease right-of-use assets. Other liabilities include the related 
tax-oriented investment liabilities of $669 million and lease liabilities of $748 million. 
The following describes the accounting policies and fair value methodologies generally used by the Firm for the 
following assets acquired and liabilities assumed: core deposit and customer relationship intangibles, shared-loss 
agreements and the related indemnification assets, Purchase Money Note, and FHLB advances. 
For further discussion of the Firm’s accounting policies and valuation methodologies, refer to Notes 2 and 3 for fair 
value measurement, Note 10 for investment securities, Note 12 for loans, Note 17 for deposits, and Note 28 for 
lending-related commitments.
Core deposit and customer relationship intangibles
Core deposit and certain wealth management 
customer relationship intangibles were acquired as 
part of the First Republic acquisition. The core deposit 
intangible of $1.3 billion was valued by discounting 
estimated after-tax cost savings over the remaining 
useful life of the deposits using the favorable source of 
funds method. The after-tax cost savings were 
estimated based on the difference between the cost of 
maintaining the core deposit base relative to the cost 
of next best alternative funding sources available to 
market participants. The customer relationship 
intangibles of $180 million were valued by discounting 
estimated after-tax earnings over their remaining 
useful lives using the multi-period excess earnings 
method. Both intangible asset valuations utilized 
assumptions that the Firm believes a market 
participant would use to estimate fair values, such as 
growth and attrition rates, projected fee income as well 
as related costs to service the relationships, and 
discount rates. The core deposit and customer 
relationship intangibles are amortized over a projected 
period of future cash flows of approximately 7 years. 
Refer to Note 15 for further discussion on other 
intangible assets.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2024 Form 10-K

Indemnification assets - Shared-loss agreements
The indemnification assets represent forecasted 
recoveries from the FDIC associated with the sharedloss assets over the respective shared-loss recovery 
periods. The indemnification assets were recorded at 
fair value in other assets on the Consolidated balance 
sheets on the acquisition date. The fair values of the 
indemnification assets were estimated based on the 
timing of the forecasted losses underlying the related 
allowance for credit losses. The subsequent quarterly 
remeasurement of the indemnification assets is based 
on changes in the amount and timing of forecasted 
losses in the allowance for credit losses associated 
with the shared-loss assets and is recorded in other 
income. Under certain circumstances, the Firm may be 
required to make a payment to the FDIC upon 
termination of the shared-loss agreements based on 
the level of actual losses and recoveries on the sharedloss assets. The estimated potential future payment is 
reflected as contingent consideration as part of the 
purchase price consideration.
Purchase Money Note and FHLB advances
The Purchase Money Note is recorded in long-term 
debt on the Consolidated balance sheets. The fair 
value of the Purchase Money Note was estimated 
based on a discounted cash flow methodology and 
incorporated estimated market discount rates. 
The FHLB advances assumed in the acquisition are 
recorded in short-term borrowings and in long-term 
debt. The fair values of the FHLB advances were based 
on a discounted cash flow methodology and 
considered the observed FHLB advance issuance 
rates.
Loans
The following table presents the unpaid principal balance ("UPB") and fair values of the loans acquired as of May 1,

Unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information 
The following table presents certain unaudited pro forma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2023 
and 2022 as if the First Republic acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2022, including recognition of the estimated 
bargain purchase gain of $2.8 billion and the provision for credit losses of $1.2 billion. Additional adjustments include 
the interest on the Purchase Money Note and the impact of amortizing and accreting certain estimated fair value 
adjustments related to intangible assets, loans and lending-related commitments.
The Firm expects to achieve operating cost savings and other business synergies resulting from the acquisition that 
are not reflected in the pro forma amounts. The pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of the historical 
results of operations had the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2022, nor is it indicative of the results of operations in 
future periods.

Consolidated average balance sheets, interest and 
rates
Provided below is a summary of JPMorganChase’s 
consolidated average balances, interest and rates on a 
taxable-equivalent basis for the years 2022 through 
2024. Income computed on a taxable-equivalent basis 
is the income reported in the Consolidated statements 
of income, adjusted to present interest income and 
rates earned on assets exempt from income taxes (i.e., 
federal taxes) on a basis comparable with other 
taxable investments. The incremental tax rate used for

2023 Interest 
2022 Average balance 
2023 Rate 
2022 Interest 

The table below presents an attribution of net interest income between volume and rate. The attribution between 
volume and rate is calculated using annual average balances for each category of assets and liabilities shown in the 
table and the corresponding annual rates (refer to pages 322-325 for more information on average balances and rates). 
In this analysis, when the change cannot be isolated to either volume or rate, it has been allocated to volume. The annual 
rates include the impact of changes in market rates, as well as the impact of any change in composition of the various 
products within each category of asset or liability. This analysis is calculated separately for each category without 
consideration of the relationship between categories (for example, the net spread between the rates earned on assets 
and the rates paid on liabilities that fund those assets). As a result, changes in the granularity or groupings considered in 
this analysis would produce a different attribution result, and due to the complexities involved, precise allocation of 
changes in interest rates between volume and rates is inherently complex and judgmental.

Credit derivatives: Financial instruments whose value 
is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt 
of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) which allow 
one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk 
to another party (the protection seller). Upon the 
occurrence of a credit event by the reference entity, 
which may include, among other events, the bankruptcy 
or failure to pay its obligations, or certain restructurings 
of the debt of the reference entity, neither party has 
recourse to the reference entity. The protection 
purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the 
difference between the face value of the CDS contract

derivative contract. The determination as to whether a 
credit event has occurred is generally made by the

Embedded derivatives: are implicit or explicit terms or 
features of a financial instrument that affect some or all 
of the cash flows or the value of the instrument in a 
manner similar to a derivative. An instrument containing 
such terms or features is referred to as a “hybrid.” The 
component of the hybrid that is the non-derivative 
instrument is referred to as the “host.” For example, 
callable debt is a hybrid instrument that contains a plain 
vanilla debt instrument (i.e., the host) and an embedded 
option that allows the issuer to redeem the debt issue at 
a specified date for a specified amount (i.e., the 
embedded derivative). However, a floating rate 
instrument is not a hybrid composed of a fixed-rate 
instrument and an interest rate swap.

the principal amount of a loan and the appraised value 
of the collateral (i.e., residential real estate) securing the 
loan.

home price index measured at the metropolitan 
statistical area (“MSA”) level. These MSA-level home 
price indices consist of actual data to the extent 
available and forecasted data where actual data is not 
available. As a result, the estimated collateral values 
used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual 
appraised loan-level collateral values; as such, the

Mortgage origination channels:
Retail – Borrowers who buy or refinance a home 
through direct contact with a mortgage banker

or by phone. Borrowers are frequently referred to a 
mortgage banker by a banker in a Chase branch, real 
estate brokers, home builders or other third parties.
Correspondent – Banks, thrifts, other mortgage banks 
and other financial institutions that sell closed loans to 
the Firm.
Mortgage product types: 
Alt-A 
Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than 
subprime loans but have characteristics that would 
disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. 
Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or more 
of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high 
CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied 
properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio above normal 
limits. A substantial proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans 
are those where a borrower does not provide complete 
documentation of his or her assets or the amount or 
source of his or her income. 
Option ARMs 
The option ARM real estate loan product is an 
adjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the 
borrower with the option each month to make a fully 
amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The 
minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on 
the interest rate charged during the introductory 
period. This introductory rate is usually significantly 
below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is 
calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the 
introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate 
charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate 
and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. 
The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover 
interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid 
interest is deferred and added to the principal balance 
of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment 
recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully 
amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance 
and anniversary date triggers. 
Prime 
Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good 
credit records who meet specific underwriting 
requirements, including prescriptive requirements 
related to income and overall debt levels. New prime 
mortgage borrowers provide full documentation and 
generally have reliable payment histories. 
Subprime 
Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were 
offered to certain customers with one or more high risk 
characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) 
unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio 
of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid mortgage 
insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an 
occupancy type for the loan is other than the borrower’s

status when full payment of principal and interest is not 
expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when 
principal and interest have been in default for a period 
of 90 days or more unless the loan is both well-secured 
and in the process of collection. Collateral-dependent 
loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual status. 
Nonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include 
nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and 
certain assets acquired in loan satisfactions, 
predominantly real estate owned and other commercial 
and personal property.
NSFR: Net Stable Funding Ratio

bilaterally between two derivative counterparties, where 
one or both counterparties is a derivatives dealer. 
Over-the-counter cleared (“OTC-cleared”) 
derivatives: Derivative contracts that are negotiated 
and executed bilaterally, but subsequently settled via a 
central clearing house, such that each derivative 
counterparty is only exposed to the default of that 
clearing house. 
Overhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage 
of total net revenue.
Parent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Participating securities: Represents unvested sharebased compensation awards containing nonforfeitable 
rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively,

under its share-based compensation programs, which 
entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends 
during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the 
dividends paid to holders of common stock. These 
unvested awards meet the definition of participating 
securities. Under the two-class method, all earnings 
(distributed and undistributed) are allocated to each 
class of common stock and participating securities, 
based on their respective rights to receive dividends.

banks.
PRA: Prudential Regulation Authority 
Preferred stock dividends: reflects dividends declared 
and deemed dividends upon redemption of preferred 
stock
Pre-provision profit/(loss): Represents total net 
revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes 
that this financial measure is useful in assessing the 
ability of a lending institution to generate income in 
excess of its provision for credit losses.
Pre-tax margin: Represents income before income tax 
expense divided by total net revenue, which is, in 
management’s view, a comprehensive measure of 
pretax performance derived by measuring earnings 
after all costs are taken into consideration. It is one 
basis upon which management evaluates the 
performance of AWM against the performance of their 
respective competitors.
Principal transactions revenue: Principal transactions 
revenue is driven by many factors, including: 
• the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between 
the price at which a market participant is willing and 
able to sell an instrument to the Firm and the price at 
which another market participant is willing and able to 
buy it from the Firm, and vice versa; and 
• realized and unrealized gains and losses on financial 
instruments and commodities transactions, including 
those accounted for under the fair value option, 
primarily used in client-driven market-making 
activities. 
– Realized gains and losses result from the sale of 
instruments, closing out or termination of 
transactions, or interim cash payments. 
– Unrealized gains and losses result from changes in 
valuation. 
In connection with its client-driven market-making 
activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity 
instruments, derivatives and commodities, including 
physical commodities inventories and financial 
instruments that reference commodities. 
Principal transactions revenue also includes realized 
and unrealized gains and losses related to: 
• derivatives designated in qualifying hedge 
accounting relationships, primarily fair value hedges 
of commodity and foreign exchange risk; 
• derivatives used for specific risk management 
purposes, primarily to mitigate credit, foreign 
exchange and interest rate risks.
Production revenue: Includes fees and income 
recognized as earned on mortgage loans originated 
with the intent to sell, and the impact of risk 
management activities associated with the mortgage 
pipeline and warehouse loans. Production revenue also 
includes gains and losses on sales and lower of cost or 
fair value adjustments on mortgage loans held-for-sale 
(excluding certain repurchased loans insured by U.S. 
government agencies), and changes in the fair value of 
financial instruments measured under the fair value 
option.
PSU(s): Performance share units

comprehensive approaches for calculating RWA (a 
Standardized approach and an Advanced approach) 
which include capital requirements for credit risk, 
market risk, and in the case of Basel III Advanced, also 
operational risk. Key differences in the calculation of 
credit risk RWA between the Standardized and 
Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced, 
credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches 
which largely rely on the use of internal credit models 
and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, 
credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory riskweightings which vary primarily by counterparty type 
and asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a 
generally consistent basis between Basel III 
Standardized and Basel III Advanced.

within income tax expense.
