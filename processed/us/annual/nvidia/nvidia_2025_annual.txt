“We’re building the essential infrastructure for the 
AI era—across clouds, enterprises, and robotics. 
This is more than a computing transition. It’s 
the foundation for a new industrial age.”

A new industrial 
revolution is underway—
transforming energy into 
artificial intelligence. 
The factory of this industrial 
revolution, an AI factory, is powered 
by computers created by NVIDIA. 
For decades, computing advanced 
through hand-coded software 
executed on CPUs. That model has 
reached its limits. Today, computers 
learn to understand, reason, and solve 
problems using machine learning 
algorithms running on GPUs. 
AI is the new model of computing. 
This transformation is global, 
sweeping across every market and 
institution—from digital customer 
service and drug discovery to financial 
trading, software development, 
robotics, and self-driving cars.
Just as bits are the fundamental 
units of classical computing, tokens 
are the atomic units of digital 
intelligence—the symbols through 
which AI expresses thought. Each 
token is a fragment of meaning: a 
word, a piece of code, a strand of 
DNA. In sequence, they form thoughts, 
instructions, stories, and reasoning.
NVIDIA computers are the thinking 
machines that generate these 
tokens, the currency of the AI age.
A new type of infrastructure has 
emerged—AI factories. Just as earlier 
factories forged steel or assembled 
cars, AI factories generate tokens, 
transforming data into intelligence. 
And just as power plants fueled the 
industrial economy, AI factories will 
power the intelligence economy.
At NVIDIA, we are building this future—
designing the engines of the AI age and 
creating the factories that will power 
the next wave of human progress.
GTC 2025
Our annual GTC conference—hailed 
as the “Woodstock of AI”—is the 
launchpad of the AI industry. This year, 
nearly 27,000 attendees gathered in 
San Jose, with hundreds of thousands 
more joining online. They came from 
some 100 countries, more than 10,000 
companies, and more than 400 of the 
world’s most promising startups. 
GTC 2025 showcased the accelerating 
frontier of AI: reasoning and inferencetime scaling that will drive a 100x 
increase computing demand; our 
computing roadmap from NVIDIA 
Blackwell to Rubin to Feynman; 
and the rise of the next waves—
agentic AI and physical AI—beyond 
perception and generative AI.
We introduced new platforms and 
partnerships to bring AI to every 
enterprise and industry, and unveiled 
transformative technologies for 
robotics and autonomous machines.
GTC 2025 made it unmistakenly 
clear: NVIDIA has transformed 
from a chip company to a fullstack computing platform, to 
data center-scale AI systems, to 
the AI infrastructure company.
Today, companies and countries 
rely on NVIDIA to build the essential 
infrastructure of the AI age. 
In the decade ahead, trillions of dollars of 
AI infrastructure will be built, reshaping 
the $100 trillion global economy.
Dear NVIDIANs 
and Stakeholders, 
Financials and Strategic 
Positioning
This year marked a structural shift in the 
computing economy. Fiscal 2025 was not 
a transition, it was a break from the past. 
AI models moved beyond answering 
questions to reasoning through complex 
tasks. Inference workloads surpassed 
training. And AI infrastructure expanded 
beyond centralized data centers into 
factories, vehicles, hospitals, and homes 
around the world. This metamorphosis 
drove exceptional performance.
 › Revenue more than doubled to 
$130.5 billion, up 114% year-over-year
 › Operating income rose 147% to 
$81.5 billion
 › Earnings per share grew 147% to $2.94
The fourth quarter capped a 
defining year:
 › $39.3 billion in revenue, up 78% 
year-over-year and 12% sequentially
 › $22.1 billion in net income
 › $16.6 billion in operating cash flow
From Training to Reasoning
Data center revenue reached $115.2 
billion, up 142% year-over-year.
Q4 alone delivered $35.6 billion, including 
$11 billion in Blackwell revenue, the fastest 
product ramp in our company’s history.
What began with training is now shifting 
toward real-time reasoning. Inference 
has become the dominant workload, and 
agentic systems are entering production 
across sovereign AI initiatives, Fortune 
500 enterprises, and edge deployments.
Full Stack, End-to-End 
AI Infrastructure
The Blackwell platform integrates 
GPU, CPU, NVLink, Spectrum-X, and 
NVIDIA software into a unified system, 
optimized for every stage of AI, from 
pre-training and post-training to 
real-time reasoning and inference. 
As AI factories become multi-billiondollar investments, the need for assured 
performance, reliability, and long-term 
support is critical. AI continues to 
advance and change at an incredible 
pace. With NVIDIA’s leadership across 
every phase of AI, rich ecosystem, 
programmability, and generations 
of experience, customers can have 
complete confidence to scale to the 
largest infrastructures with us. 
We made tremendous progress this 
year. NVIDIA is now a full-stack AI 
company—spanning chips, systems, 
software, and AI models delivered 
through NVIDIA Inference Microservices 
(NIMs), a fully operational AI model 
packaged in a container. To accelerate 
deployment, we introduced NIMs, AI 
Blueprints, and the Nemotron model 
family, enabling enterprises across 
finance to healthcare to adopt AI faster.
NVIDIA is an end-to-end AI 
infrastructure platform, from GPUs 
(Blackwell) and CPUs (Grace) to network 
processors (CX and Bluefield), scaleup NVLink switches, and scale-out 
networking with Quantum (InfiniBand) 
and Spectrum (Ethernet). Each is worldclass, highly differentiated, and deeply 
integrated with NVIDIA software.
We’ve fundamentally redefined what we 
build. Instead of assembling AI systems 
from separately designed components, 
we now architect and design full-stack, 
end-to-end AI factories. Blackwell, 
Rubin, and Feynman aren’t just chips, 
they’re AI factories: purpose-built to 
scale, deeply optimized, and supported 
across their operational lifetimes.
Though we architect AI factories as 
a unit, we open the architectures to 
integrate seamlessly into the diverse 
environments of our customers, 
delivered by a global network of 
system makers across the supply 
chain. This enables a scale and 
velocity in deploying these oneand-a-half-ton AI supercomputers 
the world has never seen before.
Operational Scale, 
Disciplined Investment
We’re investing at pace—with discipline, 
efficiency, and purpose. Operating 
expenses rose 45% year-over-year 
to $16.4 billion, reflecting sustained 
investment in engineering, compute 
infrastructure, our global supply chain, 
developers, and go-to-market partners.
AI demands massive infrastructure 
scale—more than silicon. It requires 
a full-stack ecosystem: software, 
systems, and a global supply chain 
capable of delivering end-to-end AI 
factories at incredible speed and 
scale. We ended the fiscal year with:
 › $43.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, 
and marketable securities
 › $64.1 billion in operating cash flow
 › $34.5 billion of cash returned to 
shareholders, including $33.7 billion in 
buybacks and $834 million in dividends
Engineering for Continuity
We’re operating in a dynamic 
environment—marked by shifting 
policies, evolving demand, and 
rapid technological adoption. Our 
model is designed for resilience:
 › Geographically diversified 
manufacturing across foundries, 
substrates, and systems makers
 › $30.8 billion in supply commitments 
to support customer continuity
 › Deep partnerships with Amazon, Cisco, 
Microsoft, Oracle, Google, CoreWeave, 
and others to scale across markets

 › Sovereign AI clusters in Japan, 
France, India, and Canada
 › Enterprise AI partners including 
Dell, HPE, Accenture, Deloitte, 
ServiceNow, SAP, and more
 › Industrial AI partners including 
Cadence, Synopsys, Siemens, 
Foxconn, and more
In the coming years, every company 
will operate AI factories they built 
or rent, and every country will build 
and operate AI factories as part of 
their critical infrastructure. NVIDIA 
is their partner to build these 
foundational deployments, at scale.
This year, for the first time, NVIDIA 
began manufacturing AI chips 
and supercomputers in the United 
States. In partnership with TSMC, 
Foxconn, Wistron, Amkor, and SPIL, we 
secured over a million square feet of 
advanced manufacturing space across 
Arizona and Texas. These facilities 
will produce Blackwell chips and 
assemble full AI systems—bringing AI 
infrastructure closer to the industries 
and institutions that depend on it. 
Within the next four years, we expect 
up to half a trillion dollars of AI 
infrastructure to be built on U.S. soil—
strengthening supply chains, creating 
new jobs, and accelerating our nation’s 
leadership in advanced compute.
From Perception to 
Physical Intelligence
A decade ago, AI was in its infancy. 
In 2012, AlexNet ignited the deep 
learning revolution, demonstrating 
that GPUs could train neural networks 
with superhuman accuracy. What 
began with pattern recognition 
quickly evolved into machines that 
could see, hear, and understand.
Perception AI enabled computers 
to understand the world—powering 
breakthroughs in speech recognition, 
medical imaging, and personalized 
recommendations. 
Then came generative AI: AI that 
creates new content. From text 
and images to code and proteins, 
generative AI is a new computing 
model, shifting from processing 
data and retrieving information 
to generating original content.
Now we’re entering the era of agentic AI; 
AI that can analyze, reason, plan, and use 
tools to solve problems. These intelligent 
systems act as digital teammates, 
automating workflows, accelerating 
development, and assisting in everything 
from customer service to healthcare.
Our Nemotron models, purpose-built 
for reasoning and deployed as NIMs, 
along with our tools for building custom 
agents, make it easy for any company 
to create, train, and deploy agentic AI.
Next is physical AI—intelligent systems 
that operate in the real world. From 
autonomous machines in warehouses 
to robotic assistants in hospitals 
and self-driving cars, physical AI is 
built to work safely alongside us. 
From One to Three 
AI Scaling Laws
AI is now governed by three scaling 
laws—each demonstrating more 
compute leads to smarter AI: 
1. Pre-Training Scaling: The original 
law: more data, larger models, and 
more compute produce more capable 
systems. This remains foundational.
2. Post-Training Scaling: Models 
continue to improve after initial training. 
Fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, 
human feedback, and synthetic data 
generation drive exponential refinement. 
At scale, post-training can be even more 
compute-intensive than pre-training.
3. Inference (Test-Time) Scaling: 
Inference is no longer a one-shot 
process, it’s real-time reasoning. Models 
dynamically allocate compute to 
think through complex tasks, explore 
alternatives, and plan actions. Agentic 
AI depends on this capability. Reasoning 
or “thinking” can require 100x more 
compute than one-shot inference.
With hundreds of millions of users 
engaging AI, and agentic AI systems 
operating continuously in the 
background, inference has become the 
most compute-intensive phase of AI.
Every interaction with a computer 
will trigger AI inference. And as 
agentic AI begins preempting 
tasks and responding to complex 
requests, inference workloads will 
scale dramatically—driving massive 
deployments of AI factories.
Enter Blackwell
Blackwell isn’t just faster. It’s the first 
architecture purpose-built for every 
stage of AI, from training to reasoning 
at scale. With FP4 precision, longcontext processing, and dynamic 
compute allocation, it makes testtime scaling real time as well as 
energy and cost efficient. Now in full 
production, Blackwell is NVIDIA’s 
fastest product ramp ever—powering 
AI infrastructure across hyperscalers, 
enterprises, and sovereign clouds.
At its core is the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72: 
72 GPUs, 36 Grace CPUs, unified by 
NVLink, Spectrum-X Ethernet, and 
liquid or air cooling. It delivers up 
to 30x faster inference for trillionparameter models like GPT-4 or Grok3—at the lowest total cost per watt, 
per rack, and per dollar invested.
A Full-Stack Platform for 
Scaling Intelligence
Blackwell is more than silicon. 
Its supporting technologies are 
foundational to the next wave of 
AI factories:
 › NVLink 5 and NVSwitch connect 
72 Blackwell GPUs into a massive 
compute resource enabling exascale 
performance for AI factories.
 › Spectrum-X extends networking 
capabilities to support scaleout AI factories with hundreds 
of thousands of GPUs.
 › Silicon photonics unlocks efficient 
multi-rack GPU scaling—laying the 
foundation for ultra-large-scale AI 
factories with millions of GPUs.
These advances make Blackwell the 
compute engine behind AI’s next 
industrial phase.
The Operating System 
of AI Factories
Announced at GTC, NVIDIA Dynamo is 
the inference operating system of the 
AI factory. Dynamo smartly schedules 
incoming queries and orchestrates 
compute resources to minimize 
response time while maximizing 
factory throughput. In DeepSeek-R1, 
Dynamo boosted inference throughput 
by 30x, cutting the cost of longcontext reasoning dramatically.
The world’s top cloud providers—
Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and 
Oracle—have increased their investment 
in Blackwell, with early orders already 
exceeding Hopper’s peak volumes.
What’s Next: Blackwell 
Ultra and Rubin
Later this year, Blackwell Ultra arrives—
boosting memory bandwidth, energy 
efficiency, and long-context support 
for agentic and multimodal models. It’s 
purpose-built for real-time planning, 
decision-making, and AI-native 
applications. Compared to Hopper, it 
delivers up to 50x more AI factory value.
Rubin, our next-generation platform, 
is built for a world defined by trillionparameter agentic AI models. Blackwell 
today. Blackwell Ultra tomorrow. 
Rubin on the horizon. And Feynman 
beyond. Each generation pushes 
technology to the limits of physics, 
increasing AI factory throughput 
while reducing cost per token 
generated. And every generation is 
architecturally compatible, preserving 
the massive software investments 
made by the global ecosystem of AI 
researchers and software developers 
building on the NVIDIA platform. 
NVIDIA is the engine powering the 
world’s AI infrastructure.
By providing a multi-year view, we enable 
the world’s vast supply chain—upstream 
and downstream—to prepare, align, and 
innovate alongside NVIDIA as we push 
technology to the limits of physics.
CUDA-X Accelerates 
Industries
The AI revolution is powered as much 
by software as by hardware. CUDA-X, 
our suite of over 400 acceleration 
libraries, bridges NVIDIA GPUs with 
real-world applications, delivering 
exponential performance gains across 
AI, supercomputing, and data analytics. 
Optimized for highly efficient parallel 
processing, these libraries unlock up to 
200x acceleration, enabling massivescale training, real-time inference, and 
high-throughput data processing.
Key libraries include:
 › NVIDIA cuDNN is the backbone of 
deep learning training and inference
 › TensorRT and TensorRT-LLM deliver 
accelerated inference for LLMs
 › RAPIDS accelerates data analytics 
and ML pipelines by up to 50x
 › NVIDIA Parabricks reduces genome 
sequencing from days to minutes
 › NVIDIA cuQuantum accelerates 
quantum circuit simulation and lays 
the foundation for hybrid computing, 
where every data center will one 
day have a QPU alongside a GPU
Across sectors—from healthcare 
to finance to robotics—CUDA-X is 
the software foundation of modern 
AI computing. With over 6 million 
developers and 40,000 companies 

building on our platforms, the CUDA 
ecosystem has become one of the 
largest technical communities in the 
world, driving a flywheel of innovation, 
platform adoption, and long-term value 
creation. CUDA doesn’t just accelerate 
compute—it accelerates progress.
A Digital Workforce, 
Working Alongside Humans
For decades, computing meant 
people using software to do work. We 
are now entering a new era where 
software does the work itself.
Agentic AI goes far beyond chatbots. 
These systems understand the task, 
interface directly with business 
systems, read and understand 
retrieved information, and use 
tools and automate complex work—
operating like digital employees, but 
with a speed, scale, and consistency 
no human workforce can match.
Enterprises can hire or build an AI 
workforce. Most will do both.
AI agents are being deployed across 
customer service, engineering, finance, 
legal, marketing, and operations. Some 
are generalist business operations AI 
agents. Others are highly specialized 
in software coding, supply chain 
optimization, or chip design. They 
don’t just assist. They learn, codify, 
and preserve institutional knowledge, 
ensuring continuity across generations.
Enterprise IT is becoming the HR 
function for AI agents—onboarding, 
training, and managing the digital 
workforce. Agents are given 
roles, evaluated on performance, 
and continuously improved.
Supporting this evolution requires 
a new kind of infrastructure. Agentic 
AI isn’t powered by a single model—it 
runs on systems of models working 
together, in real time. NVIDIA 
provides the full-stack foundation:
 › NeMo to train and fine-tune agents 
on proprietary enterprise data
 › NeMo Guardrails to align behavior, 
enforce policy, and ensure safety
 › NIMs—AI models in a box—
deployable as microservices across 
cloud, on-prem, and edge
 › Agent Blueprints to launch 
ready-made, domain-specific 
agents at speed
This global rollout is supported by 
consulting and systems integration 
leaders like Accenture, Deloitte, and 
Infosys, with thousands of trained 
professionals helping enterprises build 
agentic AI on the NVIDIA platform.
Soon, billions of digital agents will 
work alongside humans, reshaping 
how businesses operate. This is 
more than a technical shift—it’s 
an economic transformation. 
AI Enters the Physical World
The next wave of AI is here: physical 
AI—robots and autonomous machines 
that can perceive, reason, and act 
in the real world. Physical AI is 
transforming warehouses, factories, 
hospitals, and mobility itself.
Everything that moves—cars, forklifts, 
surgical arms, warehouse bots—is 
becoming autonomous. Industry leaders 
are already deploying these systems:
 › GM, Toyota, and MercedesBenz are building autonomous 
vehicles with NVIDIA DRIVE
 › Amazon is automating logistics 
with NVIDIA-powered robotics
 › Johnson & Johnson is building NVIDIA 
AI-powered systems to assist surgery
Humanoid robots that can operate 
and work in environments made for 
humans are making rapid advances. 
At GTC, we announced NVIDIA Isaac 
GR00T N1—the world’s first open 
humanoid foundation model, trained 
in Omniverse by observing human 
demonstrations. Companies like Boston 
Dynamics, Figure AI, and Unitree 
Robotics are already building on it.
Train. Simulate. Deploy.
Bringing AI into the physical world 
requires more than intelligent 
machines. It demands an 
integrated pipeline supported by 
three computing platforms:
 › Train foundation models on 
NVIDIA AI supercomputers with 
massive, real-world datasets
 › Simulate skills in Omniverse, our 
physically accurate digital twin 
and simulation platform
 › Deploy AI models on Jetson Thor, an 
AI computer purpose-built for robotics
This closed loop shortens 
development, improves safety, and 
accelerates real-world deployment.
Understanding the 
Physical World
To operate in the physical world, AI 
must understand it. That’s why we 
built Cosmos, a World Foundation 
Model for robotics and physical AI.
Like language models learn 
grammar, Cosmos learns physics— 
gravity, friction, motion, object 
permanence, and cause and effect. 
Companies like Uber, Agile Robots, 
Neura Robotics, and many others are 
already using Cosmos to build the next 
generation of intelligent machines.
AI in Motion
Robots are no longer science 
fiction. Autonomous machines are 
no longer prototypes. 
Physical AI represents a $50 trillion 
opportunity. It will redefine how work gets 
done—from assembly lines to city streets.
Physical AI is here. And NVIDIA is 
powering it.
AI Comes Home: GeForce 
and Desktop Computing
The AI revolution began with a GeForce 
GPU in a PC. It’s expanded to the 
world’s largest data centers. Now, it’s 
coming full circle—back to the PC.
When researchers first turned to GPUs 
to train neural networks, it ignited a 
wave that redefined computing. With 
the launch of the GeForce RTX 50 
Series, that wave has returned to where 
it started—bringing AI and graphics 
together on a single platform.
Powered by the Blackwell 
architecture, RTX 50 delivers up to 
2x the performance of the previous 
generation. But more importantly, 
it changes what a PC can do.
AI is no longer enhancing 
graphics—it is graphics.
 › With DLSS 4 and neural rendering, 
RTX GPUs don’t just draw pixels—they 
predict and generate entire frames
 › The result: up to 8x faster 
performance, real-time cinematic 
lighting, and dynamic realism
 › NVIDIA Max-Q optimizations boost 
battery life by up to 40%—enabling 
portable, AI-native workflows for 
creators, developers, and researchers

Lightspeed Ahead
This year, NVIDIA went through 
a fundamental transformation 
from a chip maker to a builder of 
infrastructure—building AI factories 
that make up the infrastructure of 
the AI industry. The transformation is 
clear, and we’re still at the beginning.
Just as traditional computing became 
essential to every company, industry, 
and country, so too will AI. But AI 
demands more than yesterday’s 
data centers. It requires a new 
kind—AI factories—that produce 
intelligence at scale. And just as 
intelligence is foundational to every 
human endeavor, AI factories will 
become essential infrastructure. 
In the decade ahead, AI will evolve—from 
tools to teammates, from assistants 
to the digital workforce of companies, 
from software to physically intelligent 
robots that move through factories, 
hospitals, farms, and cities—alongside 
us, helping us, filling tens of millions 
of unfilled jobs and offsetting labor 
shortages around the world. Economies 
will grow. Productivity will increase.
A new era of computing has begun. 
A new industry is born, perhaps the 
largest of all.
At NVIDIA, we’re not merely anticipating 
this future. We’re building it.
To our employees around the world, 
thank you. You are building a once-in-ageneration company, driven by a once-ina-lifetime opportunity to reinvent an 
industry we’ve devoted our life’s work to.
We carry this responsibility with 
deep humility and unwavering 
commitment to the journey ahead.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW
Fiscal 2025 marked an extraordinary year for NVIDIA’s growth with revenue surging 114% year on year to $130.5 billion on 
strength across all market platforms. Growth was led by exceptional Data Center demand for our Hopper architecture 
used for large language models, recommendation engines, and generative AI applications. Ethernet for AI was another 
key contributor, including strong uptake of our Spectrum-X end-to-end ethernet platform. Gross margin expanded year 
on year to 75.0% and we drove strong operating leverage with operating income rising 147% to $81.5 billion and diluted 
earnings per share increasing 147% to $2.94.

Recent Refreshment and Nominee Qualifications
Our director nominees exhibit a variety of competencies, professional experience, and backgrounds, and contribute 
diverse viewpoints and perspectives to our Board. While the Board benefits from the experience and institutional 
knowledge of our longer-serving directors, it has also brought in new perspectives and ideas through the appointment of 
four new directors, and the retirement of three directors, since 2020. The Board also regularly rotates committee 
membership and chairpersons to promote a variety of viewpoints on the Board committees. The Board’s commitment to 
achieving a membership of diverse backgrounds is reflected in our Board composition. Five of our directors are women 
and four are ethnically and/or racially diverse.

Corporate Governance Highlights
Our Board is committed to strong corporate governance to promote the long-term interests of the Company and our 
stockholders. We seek a collaborative approach to stockholder issues that affect our business and to ensure that our 
stockholders see our governance and executive pay practices as well-structured. In Fall 2024, we contacted our top 
institutional stockholders, representing an aggregate ownership of 31%, to gain insights into their views on our 
corporate governance, compensation and corporate sustainability practices. 
Highlights of our corporate governance practices include: 
ü All Board members independent, except for our CEO
ü Independent Lead Director
ü Proxy access
ü Declassified Board
ü Majority voting for directors
ü Active Board oversight of risk management
ü Stockholders can call a special meeting
ü 75% or greater attendance by each Board member at 
meetings of the Board and applicable committees
ü Independent directors frequently meet in executive
 sessions
ü At least annual Board and committee self-assessments 
ü Annual stockholder outreach, including Lead Director 
participation
ü Stock ownership guidelines for our directors and NEOs
As discussed below, in response to stockholder approval of a related non-binding stockholder proposal at the 2024 
Meeting, Proposal 4 requests stockholder approval of an amendment and restatement of our Charter to remove its 
remaining supermajority voting provisions.
Advisory Approval of Executive Compensation for Fiscal 2025 (Proposal 2)
We are asking our stockholders to cast a non-binding vote, also known as “say-on-pay,” to approve our NEOs’ 
compensation. The Board believes that our compensation policies and practices are effective in achieving our goals of 
paying for performance, providing competitive pay so that we may attract and retain a high-caliber executive team, 
aligning our executives’ interests with those of our stockholders to create long-term value, and achieving simplicity and 
transparency with our compensation program. The Board and our stockholders have approved holding our “say-on-pay” 
votes annually. The Board recommends that you vote FOR Proposal 2. 

Executive Compensation Highlights
Our executive compensation program is designed to reward performance. We use compensation elements that align our 
NEOs’ interests with those of stockholders to drive long-term value. Our NEOs’ compensation is heavily weighted toward 
performance-based, “at-risk” variable cash and long-term equity awards, which are earned only if the Company achieves 
pre-established financial metrics, with caps on maximum payouts. In recent years, over 90% of our CEO’s and over 45% of 
our other NEOs’ target pay has been performance-based and at-risk. Additionally, 100% of our CEO’s equity awards have 
been granted as PSUs.
For Fiscal 2025, in recognition of the increased complexity and scope of executives’ roles and responsibilities, the CC 
increased target equity opportunities for all NEOs. The CC also increased our CEO’s base salary and target variable cash 
opportunity for the first time in years to align with peers and ensure internal pay equity with the base salaries of other 
NEOs, and shifted the mix of performance-based equity towards MY PSUs for our NEOs (excluding our CEO) to give more 
weight to long-term performance incentives. To motivate executives, the CC set certain Base Compensation Plan goals 
significantly above strong Fiscal 2024 results and Threshold goals well above our Fiscal 2024 Stretch Compensation Plan.
Financial Performance and Link to Executive Pay
As described in CD&A, a significant portion of our executive pay opportunities are tied to the achievement of financial 
measures that drive business value and contribute to our long-term success. The table below shows our goals for the 
applicable periods that were completed at the end of Fiscal 2025 and their impact on our executive pay.

Ratification of Selection of PwC as our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for Fiscal 2026 (Proposal 3)
While not required, we are asking our stockholders to ratify the AC’s selection of PwC as our independent registered 
public accounting firm for Fiscal 2026, as we believe it is a matter of good corporate practice. If our stockholders do not 
ratify the selection, the AC will reconsider the appointment, but may nevertheless retain PwC. Even if the selection is 
ratified, the AC may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time if it determines that 
such a change would be in the best interests of NVIDIA and our stockholders. The Board recommends that you 
vote FOR Proposal 3. 
Amend and Restate Charter to Remove All Supermajority Provisions (Proposal 4)
At the 2024 Meeting, our stockholders approved a non-binding stockholder proposal requesting the Board to take steps 
to remove supermajority voting provisions in our Charter and Bylaws. Following deliberation and engagement with 
stockholders, the Board approved, adopted and declared advisable an amendment and restatement of our Charter to 
remove the remaining supermajority voting provisions, remove inoperative provisions related to a previously effected 
forward stock split and the completed declassification of our Board, and implement other non-substantive clarifying 
changes, subject to stockholder approval. The full text of the Proposed Charter is included in Appendix A to this proxy 
statement, with proposed new text underlined and proposed deletions crossed out. Additionally, the Board plans to 
approve conforming amendments to NVIDIA’s Bylaws, contingent on stockholder approval of this Proposal 4. The Board 
recommends that you vote FOR Proposal 4. 

Stockholder Proposal 5
A stockholder is asking our Board to remove the one-year holding period requirement in our Bylaws for stockholders to 
call a special meeting. Our Board is committed to strong corporate governance and has already adopted a balanced right 
for stockholders to call a special meeting. Our Board believes that our current Bylaws ensure stockholders have a right to 
call a special meeting to act on extraordinary, pressing events while preventing a minority of stockholders who have not 
held a financial stake in NVIDIA for a meaningful period of time from calling meetings for narrow or short-term interests. 
The Board recommends that you vote AGAINST Proposal 5.
Stockholder Proposal 6
A stockholder is asking our Board to amend its Corporate Governance Policies to adopt specific director resignation 
provisions if a director fails to receive a majority vote from stockholders. NVIDIA’s existing director resignation and 
corporate governance policies and procedures are already designed to ensure that the Board is fully accountable to 
NVIDIA’s stockholders. Our Board believes Proposal 6 seeks the adoption of additional unnecessary director resignation 
procedures and that our existing director resignation procedures strike the appropriate balance between ensuring 
director accountability and responsiveness and maintaining a role for the Board’s discretion and judgment. The Board 
recommends that you vote AGAINST Proposal 6.
Stockholder Proposal 7
A stockholder is asking our Board to publish a chart disclosing workforce data by EEOC-defined job categories, gender, 
and race. We already publish highly detailed workforce data in our Sustainability Report, based on metrics and categories 
most relevant to our business model and stakeholders. The Board believes that NVIDIA’s management is best positioned 
to assess the most appropriate workforce metrics for publication. The Board recommends that you vote AGAINST 
Proposal 7.

Corporate Sustainability 
NVIDIA invents computing technologies that improve lives and address global challenges. Our goal is to integrate sound 
CS principles and practices into every aspect of the Company. This proxy statement covers the following CS topics:

 ____________________________________________________
Information About the 2025 Meeting
Your proxy is being solicited on behalf of the Board for use at the 2025 Meeting. Our 2025 Meeting will take place 
virtually on Wednesday, June 25, 2025 at 9:00 a.m. Pacific Time. 
Virtual Meeting Philosophy and Benefits
The Board believes holding the 2025 Meeting in a virtual format invites stockholder participation, while reducing costs to 
stockholders and the Company. This balance allows the 2025 Meeting to remain focused on matters directly relevant to 
stockholder interests in an efficient way. We have designed the virtual format to protect stockholder rights, including by 
offering multiple opportunities to ask questions, publishing answers to questions received for the 2025 Meeting on our 
Investor Relations website, and providing a replay of the webcast after the 2025 Meeting.
Meeting Attendance
If you were an NVIDIA stockholder as of the close of business on the April 28, 2025 record date, or if you hold a valid 
proxy, you can attend, ask questions during, and vote at our 2025 Meeting at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/
NVDA2025. Our 2025 Meeting will be held virtually; use the Control Number included on your Notice or printed proxy card 
to enter. Anyone can also listen to the 2025 Meeting live; if you encounter any difficulties accessing the virtual 2025 
Meeting, please call the technical support number available at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/NVDA2025. 
A replay of the webcast will be available at www.nvidia.com/proxy through June 24, 2026. Even if you plan to attend the 
2025 Meeting virtually, we recommend that you also vote by proxy as described below so that your vote will be counted if 
you later decide not to attend. 
Asking Questions
We encourage stockholders to submit questions through our pre-meeting forum at www.proxyvote.com (using the 
Control Number included on your Notice or printed proxy card), as well as during the 2025 Meeting at 
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/NVDA2025. During the 2025 Meeting, we will answer as many stockholdersubmitted questions related to the business of the 2025 Meeting as time permits. We will publish on our Investor 
Relations website answers to questions as soon as practicable after the 2025 Meeting. We intend to group questions and 
answers by topic and substantially similar questions will be answered only once. To promote fairness to all stockholders 
and efficient use of the Company’s resources, we will respond to one question per stockholder. We reserve the right to 
exclude questions that are not pertinent to company business or are otherwise unsuitable for the conduct of the 2025 
Meeting.
Quorum and Voting
To hold our 2025 Meeting, we need a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at the close of business on the 
April 28, 2025 record date, or a quorum, represented at the 2025 Meeting either by attendance virtually or by proxy. On 
April 28, 2025, there were 24,387,557,065 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote, meaning 
12,193,778,533 shares must be represented at the 2025 Meeting or by proxy to have a quorum. A list of stockholders 
entitled to vote at the close of business on the record date will be available at our headquarters, 2788 San Tomas 
Expressway, Santa Clara, California, for 10 days prior to the 2025 Meeting to stockholders of record for any legally valid 

purpose germane to the 2025 Meeting. To schedule an appointment to view the stockholder list during this period, 
please contact us at shareholdermeeting@nvidia.com.
Your shares will count towards the quorum only if you submit a valid proxy or vote at the 2025 Meeting. Abstentions and 
broker non-votes will count towards the quorum requirement. If there is not a quorum, a majority of the votes present 
may adjourn the 2025 Meeting to another date.
For Proposal 1, you may vote FOR or AGAINST any Board nominee, or you may ABSTAIN from voting. For each other 
matter to be voted on, you may vote FOR or AGAINST or ABSTAIN from voting. 
Stockholder of Record
You are a stockholder of record if your shares were registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, 
Computershare, on April 28, 2025. You can vote shares, change your vote, or revoke your proxy before the final vote at 
the 2025 Meeting in any of the following ways:

If you do not vote using any of the ways described above, your shares will not be voted.
Street Name Holder 
If your shares were held through a nominee, such as a bank or broker, as of April 28, 2025, then you were the beneficial 
owner of shares held in “street name,” and you have the right to direct the nominee how to vote those shares for the 
2025 Meeting. The nominee should provide you a separate Notice or voting instructions, which you should follow to tell 
the nominee how to vote. To vote by attending the 2025 Meeting virtually, you must obtain a valid proxy from your 
nominee. 
If you are a beneficial holder and do not provide voting instructions to your nominee, the nominee will not be authorized 
to vote your shares on “non-routine” matters, including elections of directors (even if not contested) and executive 
compensation (including any advisory stockholder votes on executive compensation), the amendment of the Charter, and 
stockholder proposals. This is called a “broker non-vote.” However, the nominee can still register your shares as being 
present at the 2025 Meeting for determining quorum, and the nominee will have discretion to vote for matters 
considered by the NYSE to be “routine,” including Proposal 3 regarding the ratification of the selection of our independent 
registered public accounting firm. If you are a beneficial owner and want to ensure that all of the shares you beneficially 
own are voted for or against Proposal 3, you must give your nominee specific instructions to do so or the nominee will 
have discretion to vote on that proposal. For Proposals 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7, which are “non-discretionary” items, you 
MUST give your nominee instructions in order for your vote to be counted. We strongly encourage you to vote.
Any NVIDIA stockholder whose shares are held in street name by a member brokerage firm may revoke a proxy and vote 
their shares at the 2025 Meeting only in accordance with applicable rules and procedures of the national stock 
exchanges, as used by the holder’s brokerage firm. 

Vote Count
On each matter to be voted upon, stockholders have one vote for each share of NVIDIA common stock owned as of April 
28, 2025. Votes will be counted by the inspector of election as follows:

(1) Because this is a routine proposal, there are no broker non-votes.
If you are a stockholder of record and you return a signed proxy card without marking any selections, your shares will be 
voted FOR each of the nominees listed in Proposal 1, FOR Proposals 2, 3 and 4, and AGAINST Proposals 5, 6, and 7. If any 
other matter is properly presented at the 2025 Meeting, one of the proxyholders will vote your shares using his best 
judgment.
Vote Results
Preliminary voting results will be announced at the 2025 Meeting. Final voting results will be published in a current report 
on Form 8-K, which will be filed with the SEC by July 1, 2025.
Proxy Materials
As permitted by SEC rules, we are making our proxy materials available to stockholders online at www.nvidia.com/proxy. 
On or about May 13, 2025, we sent stockholders who owned our common stock at the close of business on April 28, 2025 
(except those who previously requested electronic or paper delivery) a Notice with instructions on how to access our 
proxy materials, vote online or by telephone, and elect to receive future proxy materials electronically or in printed form 
by mail.
If you choose to receive future proxy materials electronically (via www.proxyvote.com for stockholders of record and 
www.icsdelivery.com/nvda for street name holders), you will receive an email next year with links to the proxy materials 
and proxy voting site. 
SEC rules also permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy Notice and proxy material delivery 
requirements for multiple stockholders with the same address by delivering a single Notice or set of proxy materials 
addressed to those stockholders. We follow this practice, known as “householding,” unless we have received contrary 
instructions from any stockholder at that address. 
If you received more than one Notice or full set of proxy materials, your shares are either registered in more than one 
name or held in different accounts. Please vote the shares covered by each Notice or proxy card. To modify your 
instructions so that you receive one Notice or proxy card for each account or name, contact your broker. Your 
“householding” election will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. 

To change how you receive proxy materials (electronically or in print), or to request receipt of a separate set of 
documents to a household, contact our Investor Relations Department through our website at www.nvidia.com, by email 
to shareholdermeeting@nvidia.com, by phone at (408) 486-2000, or by mail at 2788 San Tomas Expressway, Santa Clara, 
California 95051.
We will pay the entire cost of soliciting proxies. Our directors and employees may also solicit proxies in person, by 
telephone, by mail, via the Internet, or by other means. Our directors and employees will not receive any additional 
compensation for soliciting proxies. We have also retained MacKenzie Partners on an advisory basis for an approximate 
fee of $17,000; they may help us solicit proxies from brokers, bank nominees, and other institutional owners. We may 
also reimburse brokerage firms, banks, and other agents for the cost of forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners.

of business on the 90th day prior to the 2026 Meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement 
of the date of the 2026 Meeting is first made by us, whichever is later.
Other Director Nominations and Proposals
Apart from Rule 14a-8 and the proxy access provision of our Bylaws, under our Bylaws certain procedures must be 
followed for a stockholder to nominate a director or introduce an item of business at an annual meeting of stockholders. 
If you wish to nominate a director or introduce an item of business at the 2026 Meeting that is not included in our 2026

Additional Requirements and Information
We advise you to review our Bylaws, which include additional requirements for advance notice of stockholder proposals, 
director nominations, and proxy access nominations. We recognize the importance of stockholders’ ability to nominate 
directors to our Board. Accordingly, our Board will consider feedback received through our stockholder engagement 
process regarding the process and disclosure requirements of our Bylaws for nominating directors and other proposals. 
Our Board will engage with stockholders of various holdings size regarding any proposed amendments to our Bylaws that 
would require a nominating stockholder to disclose to us (i) such stockholder’s plans to nominate candidates to the 
boards of other public companies, or disclose prior director nominations or proposals that such stockholder privately 
submitted to other public companies, or (ii) information about such stockholder’s limited partners or business associates 
beyond the existing requirements of our Bylaws.

Proposal 1—Election of Directors
What am I voting on? Electing the 13 director nominees identified below to hold office until the 2026 Meeting and until 
his or her successor is elected or appointed.
Vote required for approval: Directors are elected if they receive more FOR votes than AGAINST votes.
Effect of abstentions: None.
Effect of broker non-votes: None.
Our Board currently consists of 13 members. Our nominees include 12 independent directors, as defined by the rules and 
regulations of Nasdaq, and one NVIDIA officer: Mr. Huang, who serves as our President and CEO. 
All of our directors have one-year terms and stand for election annually. Each nominee, other than Dr. Ochoa, is currently 
a director of NVIDIA previously elected by our stockholders. 
The Board expects the nominees will be available for election. If a nominee declines or is unable to act as a director, your 
proxy may be voted for any substitute nominee proposed by the Board or the size of the Board may be reduced.

Director Qualifications and Nomination of Directors
The NCGC identifies, reviews and assesses the qualifications of current and potential directors and recommends 
nominees for Board approval. In accordance with our Corporate Governance Policies and the NCGC Charter, the NCGC is 
committed to maintaining a Board with diverse perspectives and considers a nominee’s background and experience to 
ensure that a broad range of perspectives is represented. The NCGC may conduct appropriate and necessary inquiries 
into the backgrounds and qualifications of possible candidates and may engage a professional search firm to assist the 
committee in identifying, evaluating, and conducting due diligence on potential director nominees. The NCGC has not 
established specific age, gender, education, experience, or skill requirements, and instead considers numerous factors 
regarding the nominee, including those listed below, taking into account our current and future business models: 
• Integrity and candor
• Independence
• Senior leadership and operational experience
• Professional, technical and industry knowledge
• Financial expertise
• Financial community experience (including as an investor in 
other companies)
• Marketing, communications and brand management 
background
• Governance and public company board experience
• Experience with emerging technologies and new business 
models
• Regulatory, legal, and risk management expertise, including in 
cybersecurity matters
• Mix of backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives
• Human capital management experience
• Experience in academia
• Willingness and ability to devote substantial time and effort to 
Board responsibilities and Company oversight
• Ability to represent the interests of the stockholders as a whole 
rather than special interest groups or constituencies
• All relationships between the proposed nominee and any of our 
stockholders, competitors, customers, suppliers, or other 
persons with a relationship to NVIDIA
• For nominees for re-election, overall service to NVIDIA, including 
past attendance, participation and contributions to the 
activities of the Board and its committees
The NCGC and the Board understand the importance of Board refreshment, and strive to maintain an appropriate balance 
of tenure, diversity of professional experience and backgrounds, skills, and education on the Board. While the Board 
benefits from the experience and institutional knowledge that our longer-serving directors bring, it has also brought in 
new perspectives and ideas through the appointment of four new directors, and the retirement of three directors, since 
2020. The Board also regularly rotates committee membership and chairpersons to help promote different viewpoints on 
the Board committees. Our longer-tenured directors are familiar with our operations and business areas and have the 
perspective of overseeing our activities from a variety of economic and competitive environments, which enhances the 
Board’s oversight of strategy and risks. Given the growth of the Company and the breadth of our product offerings, as 
well as the increasingly complex macroeconomic and geopolitical factors we face, these experienced directors are a 
significant asset to the Board. Our newer directors have brought expertise in brand development and cybersecurity, 
familiarity with technology developments at leading academic institutions, and senior management, operating, and 
finance experience, all of which are important to supporting NVIDIA as it enters new markets. Each year, the NCGC and 
Board review each director’s individual performance, including the director’s past contributions, outside experiences and 
activities, and committee participation, and determine how his or her experience and skills continue to add value to 
NVIDIA and the Board. 

Below are the skills, competencies, and attributes that our Board considers important for our directors to have, 
considering our current business and future market opportunities:
Senior Leadership 
& Operations 
Experience
Directors with senior leadership and operations experience provide informed oversight 
of our business, and unique experiences and perspectives. They are uniquely positioned 
to contribute practical insight into business strategy and operations, driving growth, 
building and strengthening corporate culture, and supporting the achievement of 
strategic priorities and objectives.
Industry & 
Technical
Directors with industry experience and technical backgrounds facilitate within the Board 
a deeper understanding of innovations and a technical assessment of our products and 
services. 
Financial/Financial 
Community
Experience in financial matters and the financial community assists our Board with 
review of our operations and finances, including overseeing our financial statements, 
capital structure and internal controls. Those with a venture capital background also 
offer valuable stockholder perspectives.
Governance & 
Public Company 
Board
Directors with experience in corporate governance, such as service on boards and board 
committees, or as executives of other large, public companies, are familiar with the 
dynamics and operation of a board of directors and the impact that governance policies 
have on a company. This experience supports our goals of strong Board and 
management accountability, transparency, and protection of stockholder interests. 
Public company board experience also helps our directors identify challenges and risks 
we face as a public company, including oversight of strategic, operational, and 
compliance-related matters, and stockholder relations.
Emerging 
Technologies & 
Business Models
Experience in emerging technologies and business models is integral to our growth 
strategies given our unique business model and provides important insights as our 
business expands into new areas.
Marketing, 
Communications & 
Brand 
Management
Directors with experience in marketing, communications, and brand management offer 
guidance on our products directly marketed to consumers, important perspectives on 
expanding our market share, and expertise in communicating with our customers and 
other stakeholders.
Regulatory, Legal & 
Risk Management
Our business requires compliance with a variety of regulatory requirements in different 
jurisdictions. We face new regulatory matters and regulations as our business grows. 
We are also subject to multiple lawsuits. Directors with experience in governmental, 
public policy, legal, and risk management areas, including cybersecurity, help provide 
valuable insights and oversight for our Company.
Human Capital 
Management 
Experience
Our people are critical to our success. Directors with experience in organizational 
management, talent development, and developing values and culture in a large global 
workforce provide key insights. Human capital management experience also assists our 
Board in overseeing executive and employee compensation, development, and 
engagement.
The NCGC evaluates candidates proposed by stockholders using the same criteria as it uses for other candidates. 
Stockholders seeking to recommend a prospective nominee should follow the instructions under Stockholder 
Communications with the Board of Directors below. The stockholder(s) must provide timely written notice of such 
recommended nominee and the stockholder(s) and such recommended nominee must satisfy the other requirements 
specified in our Bylaws and Corporate Governance Policies, both of which are available on the Investor Relations section 
of our website at www.nvidia.com. Stockholders are advised to review these documents.
Proxy Access
Our Board has voluntarily adopted proxy access. As a result, we will include in our proxy statement information regarding 
the greater of (i) up to two director candidates or (ii) up to 20% of the number of directors in office on the last day that a 
submission may be delivered, if nominated by a stockholder (or group of up to 20 stockholders) owning at least 3% of the 
voting power of our outstanding capital stock for at least three continuous years. The stockholder(s) must provide timely 
written notice of such nomination and the stockholder(s) and nominee must satisfy the other requirements specified in 
our Bylaws. This summary of our proxy access rules is not intended to be complete and is subject to limitations set forth 
in our Bylaws and Corporate Governance Policies, both of which are available on the Investor Relations section of our 
website at www.nvidia.com. Stockholders are advised to review these documents. The NCGC did not receive any 
stockholder nominations during Fiscal 2025.

Our Director Nominees 
The biographies below include information, as of the date of this proxy statement, regarding the particular experience, 
qualifications, attributes or skills of each director, relative to the skills matrix above, that led the NCGC and Board to 
believe that he or she should continue to serve on the Board.

Information About the Board of Directors and Corporate Governance
Independence of the Members of the Board of Directors
Nasdaq rules and our Corporate Governance Policies (as further described below) require that a majority of our directors 
not have a relationship that would interfere with their exercise of independent judgment in carrying out their 
responsibilities and that they meet any other qualification requirements required by the SEC and Nasdaq. 
After considering all relevant relationships and transactions, our Board determined that, except for Mr. Huang, all of our 
directors are “independent” as defined by Nasdaq’s rules and regulations. The Board also determined that all members of 
our AC, CC, and NCGC are independent under applicable Nasdaq listing standards, and that each of Mr. Seawell, Mr. Jones 
and Ms. Lora of the AC are “audit committee financial experts” as defined under applicable SEC rules.
Board Leadership Structure
Our Board ensures that each member has an equal voice in the affairs and the management of NVIDIA by having an 
independent Lead Director, rather than a chairperson, which the Board believes best serves our stockholders. The 
independent directors consider the role and designation of the person to serve as Lead Director on an annual basis. The 
Board recognizes that different board leadership structures may be appropriate under different circumstances and its 
annual review includes consideration of whether having a Lead Director continues to best meet NVIDIA’s evolving needs 
and serves in the best interest of its stockholders. 
Our Board believes its current leadership structure is appropriate because:
The active involvement of each of our independent directors, combined with the qualifications and significant 
responsibilities of, and strong oversight by, our Lead Director, provide balance on the Board; 
It promotes independent oversight of our management and affairs; 
It effectively allocates authority, responsibility, and oversight between management and our independent 
directors; and 
It provides the right foundation to pursue the Company’s strategic and operational objectives, particularly in light 
of the evolution of our business and operating environment. 
Our CEO has primary responsibility for the operational leadership and strategic direction of the Company, and the Lead 
Director facilitates our Board’s independent oversight of management, promotes communication between management 
and our Board, and supports our Board’s consideration of key governance matters. This arrangement promotes open 
dialogue among the Board, including discussions of the independent directors during quarterly executive sessions led by 
our Lead Director, without the presence of our CEO. We believe that our current structure best serves our stockholders, 
without the need to appoint a person to serve as chairperson of the Board.
Under our Corporate Governance Policies, the Board may select a chairperson in its discretion, but, if it does not, a Lead 
Director shall be designated annually by a majority of the independent directors and identified in the Company’s proxy 
statement. These policies help to ensure a robust independent leadership structure on our Board. 
While the Board has discretion to consider other leadership structures, including having the Lead Director (or chairperson, 
if any) and CEO roles filled by a single individual, it would only consider a change if it best aligned with the interests of our 
stockholders, management, and the Board, and it complied with applicable laws and regulations. If in the future our CEO 
were to take a leadership position on the Board, such as chairperson, we expect that the Board would continue to appoint 
an independent Lead Director to maintain a balanced and strong leadership structure and otherwise represent the Board 
independently from the Company’s management team. Any changes to the Board’s leadership structure would take into 
account stockholder views, including through our ongoing stockholder outreach, and would be communicated to 
stockholders on our Investor Relations website and in our proxy statement. Our Lead Director may provide input on the 
design of the Board as requested by the NCGC. In his role as NCGC Chairperson, our Lead Director will continue to lead 
discussions, provide input, and oversee the design of the Board itself.
Our Lead Director
Stephen C. Neal
Director since 2019
Chairperson of the NCGC
Experience
ü Extensive experience as a trial attorney
ü Has advised numerous companies, boards and individuals on 
governance and legal matters
ü Helped clients manage internal and government investigations
ü Executive experience as Cooley LLP’s CEO, and board and 
chairman experience on the Levi Strauss & Co. board of directors

The Board believes Mr. Neal’s experience, breadth of knowledge, and contributions to the Board position him well to 
provide strong leadership, oversight, and the ability to contribute valuable insight with respect to the Company’s 
business. 
Our Lead Director may require Board consideration of risk matters, including adding them to Board agendas or as topics 
for executive sessions of the independent members of the Board. The Board believes that Mr. Neal is highly qualified to 
assist the Board in overseeing the identification, assessment, and management of the Company’s exposure to various 
risks as a result of his extensive risk management, legal, and executive experience and provides effective independent 
oversight of the Company’s risk exposures as Lead Director. Further information on the Board’s oversight of risk 
management and its work with the CEO to address risk management matters is detailed below under Role of the Board in 
Risk Oversight.
Our Lead Director has significant responsibilities, which are set forth in our Corporate Governance Policies, and include 
the duties listed below.
Duties of Our Lead Director
ü Determining an appropriate schedule of Board meetings and seeking to ensure that the 
independent members of the Board can perform their duties responsibly while not 
interfering with the flow of our operations
ü Working with the CEO, and seeking input from other directors and relevant management, as 
to the preparation of the agendas for Board meetings
ü Advising the CEO on a regular basis as to the quality, quantity, and timeliness of the flow of 
information requested by the Board from our management with the goal of providing what 
is necessary for the independent members of the Board to effectively and responsibly 
perform their duties, and, although our management is responsible for the preparation of 
materials for the Board, the Lead Director may specifically request the inclusion of certain 
material
ü Coordinating, developing the agenda for, and moderating executive sessions of the 
independent members of the Board and acting as principal liaison between them and the 
CEO on sensitive issues
ü Presiding over Board meetings when the CEO is not present
ü Convening meetings of the independent directors, as necessary or appropriate
ü Engaging with stockholders, as necessary or appropriate
ü Performing such other duties as the Board may determine from time to time
In addition, our Lead Director may represent the Board in communications with stockholders and other stakeholders. The 
Lead Director makes themself available for consultation with major stockholders pursuant to our Corporate Governance 
Policies. As Lead Director, Mr. Neal has participated in our annual stockholder outreach meetings and we expect this 
practice to continue.

Committees of the Board of Directors
The Board has three committees: an AC, a CC, and a NCGC. Each of these committees operates under a written charter, 
which may be viewed under Governance in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.nvidia.com.
Committee assignments are determined based on background and the expertise which individual directors can bring to a 
committee. Our Board believes regular committee rotations are a good corporate governance practice which introduces 
diverse perspectives and ideas, more fully informs its members regarding the full scope of the Board and our activities, 
and benefits each committee and the Board as a whole. The composition and functions of our committees are set forth 
below.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
At the beginning of Fiscal 2025, the CC initially consisted of Messrs. Burgess, Coxe, Dabiri, and Jones and Ms. Hudson. 
After the 2024 Meeting, the members of the CC consisted of Messrs. Burgess, Coxe, and Dabiri, Ms. Hudson and Dr. 
Shah. No member of the CC is an officer or employee of NVIDIA, and none of our executive officers serve as a member of 
the board or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving as a member of our 

Board or CC. Other than Dr. Shah, no member of the CC had a relationship requiring disclosure in Review of Transactions 
with Related Persons above.
Role of the Board in Risk Oversight
The Board oversees risk management at NVIDIA and delegates oversight of appropriate topics to its committees. The 
oversight responsibility of our Board and its committees is enabled by management reporting processes, including our 
ERM process, that are designed to provide visibility to our Board about the identification, assessment, and management 
of critical risks and management’s risk mitigation strategies.

Management
Management identifies, evaluates, and mitigates business risks and reports to the Board on them
Internal Audit
Provides independent assurance on design and effectiveness of internal controls and governance processes

support the Company’s long-term objectives and to ensure thorough assessment of these matters. 
Our Board retains direct oversight of strategic risks to NVIDIA and other risk areas not delegated to its committees. 
Board committees enhance risk oversight by allocating authority and responsibility to the committee best suited to 
oversee specific risks, as outlined in their charters, with escalation to the full Board when necessary. Committee 
chairpersons regularly report to the full Board on reviewed matters, including key risks, and collaborate with the Board to 

ensure effective risk management oversight. The Board believes its leadership structure facilitates robust risk oversight, 
with the independent Lead Director and independent committees proactively providing oversight and engagement with 
management on our key risks. For further details, see Board Leadership Structure above.
Given the importance of topics like information security, including cybersecurity, the Board retains full oversight of these 
matters. The AC reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company’s information security policies, practices, and 
internal controls. The AC receives regular updates on information security from management, including the Chief Security 
Officer and security team, while the Board receives annual reports on these matters. The AC also meets in executive 
session with leaders of key control functions, ensuring direct access to management teams and appropriate staffing and 
resources.
ERM Process
Annual assessment of the Company’s risk environment led by management
Identifies and evaluates risks across different timeframes, including short-, intermediate- and long- term
Identifies, assesses, and manages the Company’s most significant risks and uncertainties that could materially 
impact the long-term health of the Company or prevent the achievement of strategic objectives
Regular updates reported to senior management, including CEO
Overseen and reviewed by the Board and AC, at least annually
Board and committees have direct access to management to receive updates on risk exposures and mitigation 
strategies, and give feedback on key and emerging risks, including cybersecurity, trade compliance, risk 
management and the ERM process
Board and committee agendas adjusted throughout the year by CEO and Lead Director to address emerging risks 
and key topics
Includes interviews with senior management and Board members to identify major risks
The Board, its committees, and senior management may engage outside advisors, experts, and consultants to help 
develop and analyze the Company’s risk management and mitigation efforts, and anticipate future threats and 
trends
The Company’s ERM process is an annual assessment of its risk environment, integrating risk evaluation with the 
Company’s operations and strategies. This process examines internal and external factors, risk amplifiers, and emerging 
trends to prioritize mitigation efforts based on the risk horizon. It evaluates the potential impact and likelihood of risks 
materializing over relevant timeframes, considers future threats and trends, and identifies the actions, strategies, 
processes, controls, and procedures in place or to be implemented to manage and mitigate these risks. 
While the Company does not have a Chief Compliance Officer, the ERM process and action plan are reviewed by the CEO, 
other NEOs reporting directly to the CEO, and senior management members. These leaders are responsible for managing 
and monitoring key risks within their respective functional areas. The Company’s internal audit team administers the ERM 
program on behalf of management.
The ERM process is designed to align the Board’s risk oversight with the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. 
Public reports are prepared by management involved in the ERM process and reviewed by the Board or its committees to 
ensure that disclosure controls and procedures function effectively. These processes are structured to identify potential 
risks for disclosure appropriately. 
Corporate Governance 
Corporate Governance Policies
The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Policies to ensure that the Board has the necessary authority and 
processes in place to review and evaluate our business operations as needed and to make decisions that are independent 
of our management. These policies include practices the Board follows with respect to its composition and selection, 
regular evaluations of the Board and its committees, Board meetings and involvement of senior management, senior 
management performance evaluation, and Board committees and compensation. These policies may be viewed under 
Governance in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.nvidia.com.
Executive Sessions of the Board
As required under Nasdaq’s listing standards, our independent directors meet regularly in scheduled executive sessions at 
which only independent directors are present, as well as in sessions with the CEO. In Fiscal 2025, our independent 
directors met in both types of executive sessions at four of our scheduled quarterly Board meetings.
Director Attendance at Annual Meeting
We expect that our directors will attend each annual meeting, absent a valid reason. All Board members attended the 
2024 Meeting, except Dr. Ochoa who was appointed after the 2024 Meeting.

Board Self-Assessments
The NCGC oversees an evaluation process, conducted at least annually, whereby outside legal counsel for NVIDIA 
interviews each director to obtain his or her evaluation of the Board as a whole, and of the committees on which he or she 
serves. The interviews solicit ideas from the directors about, among other things, improving the quality of Board and/or 
committee oversight, effectiveness regarding strategic direction, financial and audit matters, executive compensation, 
acquisition activity, and other key matters. The interviews also focus on Board process and identifying specific issues 
which should be discussed in the future. After these evaluations are complete, our outside corporate counsel summarizes 
the results, reviews them with our Lead Director, and then submits the summary for discussion by the NCGC. 
In response to the evaluations conducted in Fiscal 2025, our Board determined to focus on geopolitical and regulatory 
risks, supply chain, AI regulations, growth management, the Company’s strategic ecosystem, and management 
development. The Board also determined to continue to focus on the Board’s composition and process for Board 
refreshment.
Director Orientation and Continuing Education
The NCGC and our General Counsel are responsible for new director orientation and for administering or approving 
eligible director continuing education programs. Continuing education programs for directors may include a combination 
of internally developed materials and presentations, programs presented by third parties, and financial and administrative 
support for attendance at qualifying academic or other independent programs. 
Director Time Commitment and Outside Board Memberships
Our directors are expected to devote sufficient time to Board and committee duties and to understanding the Company’s 
business. The NCGC reviews the other commitments of potential Board candidates, and does so annually for existing 
Board members, to determine if this expectation can be met. In making this determination, the NCGC considers, among 
other factors, stakeholder guidelines regarding numerical limits on public company boards on which a director may sit. 
None of our directors serve on more than two public company boards (including NVIDIA), and none of our non-employee 
directors serve as a CEO or executive officer of a public company.
Director Stock Ownership Guidelines
Our Corporate Governance Policies require each non-employee director to hold shares of our common stock with a total 
value equal to six times the annual cash retainer for Board service during the period in which he or she serves as a 
director (or ten times his base salary, in the case of the CEO). The shares may include vested deferred stock, shares held 
in trust, and shares held by immediate family members, but not unvested or unexercised equity awards. Non-employee 
directors have five years after their Board appointment to reach the ownership threshold. Our stock ownership 
guidelines are intended to further align director interests with stockholder interests.
Each non-employee director and Mr. Huang currently meets or exceeds the stock ownership requirements, with the 
exception of Dr. Ochoa, who joined our Board in 2024 and has five years from joining the Board to reach the ownership 
threshold.
Senior Management Development
We believe in extensive leadership development. Our structure ensures that many senior managers work directly with our 
CEO to execute our corporate strategies. This approach results in strategic alignment, exposes leaders to a broad 
spectrum of corporate activities, and presents the Board with a pool of excellent candidates for future promotion. Our 
CEO also selects senior leaders to engage directly with the Board on key initiatives and provides periodic updates to our 
Board on management development.
Outside Advisors
The Board and each of its principal committees may retain outside advisors and consultants of their choosing at our 
expense. The Board need not obtain management’s consent to retain outside advisors. In addition, the principal 
committees need not obtain either the Board’s or management’s consent to retain outside advisors.
Code of Conduct
Our directors, executives, and employees are expected to conduct themselves with the highest degree of integrity, ethics, 
and honesty. Our credibility and reputation depend upon their good judgment, ethical standards, and personal integrity. 
Our Code of Conduct applies to all executive officers, directors, and employees, including our principal executive officer, 
principal financial officer, and principal accounting officer. The Financial Team Code of Conduct applies to our executive 
officers, directors, members of our finance department, and all employees involved in the preparation and review of 
externally-reported periodic financial reports, filings, and documents. We regularly review our Code of Conduct and 
related policies to ensure that they provide clear guidance to our directors, executives, and employees. We also regularly 
train our employees on our Code of Conduct and other policies.

The Code of Conduct and the Financial Team Code of Conduct may be viewed under Governance in the Investor Relations 
section of our website, at www.nvidia.com. If we make any amendments to either code, or grant any waiver from a 
provision of either code to any executive officer or director, we will promptly disclose the nature of the amendment or 
waiver on our website or in a report on Form 8-K. Information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference 
into this or any other report we file with the SEC.
Insider Trading Policy
Our Insider Trading Policy governs transactions in our securities and applies to the Board and our employees, contractors, 
and consultants. We believe our Insider Trading Policy is reasonably designed to promote compliance with insider trading 
laws, rules and regulations applicable to NVIDIA. Section 16 directors and officers must obtain preclearance before 
trading in NVIDIA’s stock. In addition, we comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to insider trading with 
respect to transactions in our securities such as open market repurchases of our common stock from time to time. 
Under our Insider Trading Policy, hedging ownership of NVIDIA stock, including but not limited to trading in options, puts, 
calls, or other derivative instruments related to NVIDIA stock or debt, is not permitted. Additional prohibitions include 
purchasing NVIDIA stock on margin, borrowing against NVIDIA stock held in a margin account, or pledging NVIDIA stock 
as collateral for a loan. 
Corporate Hotline
We have established an independent corporate hotline to allow any employee, contractor, customer, or partner to 
confidentially and anonymously submit a complaint about any accounting, internal controls, auditing, Code of Conduct, or 
other matter of concern (unless prohibited by local privacy laws).
Stockholder Communications with the Board of Directors
Stockholders who wish to communicate with the Board regarding nominations of directors or other matters may do so by 
sending 
electronic 
written 
communications 
addressed 
Timothy 
Teter, 
our 
Secretary, 
shareholdermeeting@nvidia.com. All stockholder communications we receive that are addressed to the Board will be 
compiled by our Secretary. If no particular director is named, letters will be forwarded, depending on the subject matter, 
to the chairperson of the AC, CC, or NCGC. Matters put forth by our stockholders will be reviewed by the NCGC, which 
will determine whether these matters should be presented to the Board. The NCGC will give serious consideration to all 
such matters and will make its determination in accordance with its charter and applicable laws.
Majority Vote Standard
Under our Bylaws, in an uncontested election, stockholders will be given the choice to cast votes FOR or AGAINST the 
election of directors or to ABSTAIN from such vote and shall not have the ability to cast any other vote with respect to 
such election of directors. A director shall be elected by the affirmative vote of the majority of the votes cast with 
respect to that director, meaning the number of shares voted FOR a director must exceed the number of votes cast 
AGAINST that director. If the votes cast FOR an incumbent director in a non-contested election do not exceed the 
number of AGAINST votes, such incumbent director shall offer to tender his or her resignation to the Board. The NCGC 
or other committee that may be designated by the Board will make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept 
or reject the resignation or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on such committee’s 
recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale within 90 days from the date of certification of the 
election results. In making their decision, such committee and the Board will evaluate the best interests of the Company 
and its stockholders and shall consider all factors and information deemed relevant. The director who tenders his or her 
resignation will not participate in such committee’s recommendation or the Board’s decision.
In a contested election, in which the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, stockholders will 
be given the choice to cast FOR or WITHHOLD votes for the election of directors and shall not have the ability to cast any 
other vote with respect to such election of directors. Our directors will be elected by a plurality of the shares represented 
at any such meeting or by proxy and entitled to vote on the election of directors at that meeting. The directors receiving 
the greatest number of FOR votes will be elected.
In either case, abstentions and broker non-votes will each be counted as present for purposes of determining the 
presence of a quorum but will have no effect on the vote.
Stockholder Special Meeting Right
As part of our Board and management’s comprehensive review of current corporate governance practices, our Board 
amended our Bylaws in 2024 to let stockholders owning at least 15% of our shares, and who have owned such shares 
continuously for at least one year, to request a special meeting of stockholders, provided that the stockholders satisfy 
the disclosure, timing and other requirements set forth in our Bylaws intended to ensure that stockholders receive 
adequate, timely, and accurate information in connection with a special meeting. Our Board believes that this special 

meeting right strikes a balance between enabling urgent action and protecting the Company and its stockholders from 
narrow, short-term interests.
Board Meeting Information
The Board met four times during Fiscal 2025, including meetings during which the Board discussed the strategic 
direction of NVIDIA, explored and discussed new business and strategic opportunities and the product roadmap, and 
other matters facing NVIDIA. We expect each Board member to attend each meeting of the Board and the committees 
on which he or she serves. Each Board member attended 75% or more of the applicable meetings of the Board and of 
each committee on which he or she served during Fiscal 2025.

Corporate Sustainability
NVIDIA invents computing technologies that improve lives and address global challenges. Our goal is to integrate sound 
CS principles and practices into every aspect of the Company. Our Board and management believe that environmental 
stewardship, social responsibility, and solid governance are important to our business strategy and long-term value 
creation. While the full Board has ultimate responsibility for CS matters that impact our business, each committee of the 
Board oversees CS matters across our business operations in the areas that align with their respective responsibilities. 
The NCGC is responsible for reviewing and discussing with management our policies, issues, and reporting related to 
sustainability, including overall sustainability strategy, risks, and opportunities, and related programs and initiatives. Our 
CS team updates the NCGC at least semiannually on these topics, as well as pertinent regulations and stakeholder inputs, 
and gathers feedback from the NCGC on issues such as climate change and human rights. The CS team also reports on 
sustainability issues to the full Board annually.
In Fiscal 2024, we launched a Corporate Sustainability Steering Committee, or the CSSC, comprised of members of our 
executive leadership team. The CSSC oversees and provides input on our sustainability strategy and program. Feedback 
from the Board, the NCGC and CSSC, along with specific input from our executive team, helps to determine the focus and 
scope of our sustainability strategy and program.
The following sections provide an overview of our sustainability principles and practices. More information can be found 
on the Corporate Sustainability section of our website and in our annual Sustainability Report. Information contained on 
our website or in our annual Sustainability Report is not incorporated by reference into this or any other report we file 
with the SEC. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Form 10-K for a discussion of risks and uncertainties we face related 
to CS.
Climate and Efficiency
We assess our carbon footprint across our product lifecycle and assess climate risks, including current and emerging 
regulations and market impacts. Improving performance and energy efficiency is a principal goal in each step of our 
research, development, and design processes, and our product-level environmental assessments confirm that continuing 
to enhance the energy efficiency of our products is the most impactful sustainability initiative our company can pursue. 

Our Earth-2 initiative aims to harness AI and high-performance computing to unlock the potential of vast quantities of 
climate data to inform decision-making.
We commit to the following greenhouse gas emissions, or GHG emissions, reduction goals: 
Scope 1 and 2: In our upcoming Sustainability Report for Fiscal 2025, we plan to announce that we achieved and 
will maintain 100% renewable electricity for offices and data centers under our operational control. By delivering 
on this commitment, we continue to aim to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with prevalent climate 
science standards. 
Scope 3: By the end of Fiscal 2026, we expect to engage manufacturing suppliers comprising at least 67% of 
NVIDIA’s scope 3 category 1 GHG emissions, with the goal of effecting supplier adoption of science-based 
targets. 
Human Capital Management
We believe that our employees are our greatest asset, and they play a key role in creating long-term value for our 
stakeholders. The CC provides oversight of the Company’s human capital management, including policies and strategies 
relating to human capital management. 
To execute our business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and retain the very best talent globally, including 
exceptional executives, scientists, engineers, and technical and non-technical staff.
Recruitment
As the demand for global technical talent remains high, we have grown our technical workforce and have successfully 
attracted top talent to NVIDIA. We have attracted talent worldwide through our strong employer brand and 
differentiated hiring strategies for college, professional, and leadership talent. Our workforce is 82% technical and 51% 
hold advanced degrees. Additionally, we have increased our focus on diversity recruiting, and we welcome employees of 
all backgrounds. Our own employees help to surface top talent, with over 41% of our new hires in Fiscal 2025 coming 
from employee referrals.
Development and Retention
To support employee development, we provide opportunities to learn on-the-job through training courses, targeted 
development programs, mentoring and peer coaching and ongoing feedback. We constantly upgrade our learning 
offerings to ensure that our employees are exposed to the most current content and technologies available. We offer 

tuition reimbursement programs to subsidize educational programs and advanced certifications and encourage internal 
job mobility. We have also implemented specifically designed mentoring and development programs for women and 
employees from traditionally underrepresented groups to ensure widespread readiness for future advancement.
To evaluate employee sentiment and engagement, we use pulse surveys, a suggestion box, and an anonymous third-party 
platform. We want NVIDIA to be a place where people can build their careers over their lifetime. Our employees tend to 
come and stay. In Fiscal 2025, our overall turnover rate was 2.5%.
Compensation, Benefits, and Well-Being
Our compensation program rewards performance and is structured to encourage employees to invest in the Company’s 
future. Employees receive equity, except where unavailable due to local regulations, that is tied to the value of our stock 
price and vests over time to retain employees while simultaneously aligning their interests with those of our stockholders.
We offer comprehensive benefits to support our employees’ and their families’ physical health, well-being, and financial 
health. Programs include 401(k) programs in the U.S., statutory and supplemental pension programs outside the U.S., our 
employee stock purchase program, flexible work hours, and time off policies. We evaluate our benefit offerings globally 
and aim to provide comparable support across the regions where we operate. We offer tailored benefits based on the 
needs of our employees, including continuing support for parents, both new birth parents and those who wish to become 
parents.
Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging at NVIDIA
We believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to creating an inclusive culture that supports all our 
employees.
When recruiting new talent or developing our current employees, we strive to build a diverse talent pipeline that includes 
those underrepresented in the technology field, including women, Black/African American, and Hispanic/Latino 
candidates.
To this end we:
Hire, promote and compensate our employees based on merit;
Partner with institutions and professional organizations serving historically underrepresented communities;
Enlist dedicated recruiting teams to shepherd underrepresented candidates through the interview process and 
identify internal opportunities;
Support the development and growth of women employees through programs aimed at building a pipeline of 
future leaders;
Provide peer support and executive sponsors for our internal community resource groups;
Provide training and education to managers and peers on fostering supportive environments that allow all our 
employees to excel;
Track equity and parity in retention, promotions, pay, and employee feedback; and
Measure year over year progress and provide leadership visibility on talent and diversity efforts.
As of the end of Fiscal 2025, our global workforce was 78% male, 21% female, and 1% not declared, with 6% of our 
workforce in the United States composed of Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino employees.
We strive to provide equitable compensation and opportunities for advancement to all employees and to achieve 
promotion parity based on a variety of considerations. 
Flexible Working Environment
We support a flexible work environment, allowing us to recruit the very best employees, regardless of where they live. 
This flexibility supports diverse hiring, retention of talent, including working parents and other caregivers and employee 
engagement, which we believe makes NVIDIA a great place to work.
We also provide company-wide designated time off each quarter for employees to rest, recharge and manage personal 
and family responsibilities. 

Product Value Chain
We seek to promote human rights throughout our supply chain and expect our suppliers to respect human rights 
whenever they provide products or services for us. 
We are a full member of the RBA, an international industry organization dedicated to corporate social responsibility in 
global supply chains. Since adopting the RBA Code of Conduct in 2007 when we first became an RBA member, we have 
continued to integrate its elements into our processes, including auditing strategic suppliers and conducting internal 
assessments to confirm that we are addressing all aspects of responsible supply chain management. All of our 
manufacturing suppliers are expected to comply with the RBA Code of Conduct and associated NVIDIA policies, including 
an Agreement for Manufacturer Environmental Compliance.
We expect our suppliers to maintain progressive employment, environmental, health, safety, and ethical practices that 
meet or exceed applicable laws, the RBA Code of Conduct, our Code of Conduct, and our Human Rights Policy. We also 
encourage suppliers to use the RBA Code of Conduct as a platform to go above and beyond compliance. We monitor our 
supply chain through Validated Assessment Program audits and work directly with suppliers to implement any corrective 
actions. 
Our goal is to use only conflict-free gold, tantalum, tungsten, and tin (3TG) in our products and to achieve 100% 
Responsible Minerals Assurance Process-compliant 3TG processing facilities, as explained in more detail in our 
Responsible Minerals Policy.
Human Rights
We define human rights as the fundamental rights, freedoms, and standards of treatment belonging to all humans. We 
follow the laws of the countries in which we operate, and endorse internationally recognized principles, including the 
United Nations Global Compact, the United Nations Guiding Principles, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
the Core Conventions of the International Labour Organization, and the International Labour Organization Declaration on 
Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.
We have codified our approach to human rights in our Human Rights Policy and work to embed human rights 
considerations into decision-making processes throughout the Company.
In Fiscal 2025, we ran a human rights impact assessment (HRIA) aligned with the UN Declaration on Business and Human 
Rights. The HRIA covered our value chain and was performed by an independent firm with deep expertise in human 
rights. We expect to use the results of the HRIA to inform our human rights strategy and our Human Rights Policy going 
forward. 
Trustworthy AI
Our artificial intelligence, or AI, principles, which we share with customers and partners, reflect our core values and our 
Code of Conduct. We endeavor to deliver trustworthy AI models that comply with privacy and data protection laws, 
perform safely and as intended, provide transparency about a model’s design and limitations, minimize unwanted bias, 
and give equal opportunity to benefit from AI. 
Our products are programmable and non-specific in nature. When we provide tools to help developers create applications 
for specific industries, we focus on creating products and services that enable developers to create and accelerate 
socially beneficial applications.
Public Policy Engagement and Accountability 
Our NCGC oversees and periodically reviews our public policy engagement and accountability. Our Government Relations 
team engages in the public policy process to advance the long-term interests of the Company and its stockholders, 
including in areas relevant to our operations, semiconductors, artificial intelligence, global trade, research and 
development, workforce and energy. NVIDIA’s U.S. federal lobbying activities are disclosed quarterly and publicly reported. 
We belong to trade associations worldwide. Management reports to the NCGC about our policies and practices in 
connection with governmental relations, public policy, and related expenditures.

Director Compensation
NVIDIA’s non-employee director compensation program is designed to attract and retain a world-class Board of Directors 
while balancing our stockholders’ interests, and is structured to align with annual service starting on the dates of our 
annual meetings. We do not pay additional fees for serving as Lead Director, as chairperson or member of our 
committees, or for meeting attendance. Directors who are also employees do not receive compensation for service on 
the Board. 
Roles of the Board, the CC, and Compensation Consultant
The CC reviews our director compensation annually with the assistance of its independent compensation consultant, who 
provides peer group data and insights on compensation trends and best practices. The CC engaged Exequity LLP as its 
independent compensation consultant to advise on director compensation for the year following our 2024 Meeting, or 
the 2024 Program. The CC recommended the 2024 Program as described below, which the Board approved in December 
2023.
Afterwards, our compensation advisor from Exequity retired, and in September 2024, the CC engaged Semler Brossy to 
serve as its independent compensation consultant.
2024 Program
The 2024 Program maintained the same target compensation as the previous year with a total value of $340,000—slightly 
below the median paid to peer group non-employee directors (based on the peer group determined in late 2023): 
(1) Target annual value of RSUs granted on the day following our 2024 Meeting, or the 2024 Program RSUs. 50% of the 2024 Program RSUs vested on the 
third Wednesday in November 2024 and 50% will vest on the third Wednesday in May 2025, subject to the director’s continuous service. 
The number of shares subject to each director’s 2024 Program RSUs equaled the target value of the grant divided by the 
30-calendar day trailing average closing price of our common stock that ended the business day before the 2024 
Meeting, to smooth the effects of market volatility. 
New Director Compensation
In connection with Dr. Ochoa's appointment to the Board in November 2024, she received a prorated annual cash retainer 
and two RSU grants. She was awarded an initial RSU grant with a target value of $255,000, or the Initial Ochoa RSU, and a 
prorated 2024 Program RSU reflecting her service until the 2025 Meeting, or the Prorated Ochoa RSU. The number of 
shares subject to the Initial Ochoa RSU was calculated in the same manner as the 2024 Program RSUs, but using the 30calendar day trailing average closing price that ended the business day before her appointment. 
Deferred Compensation Program
Non-employee directors can elect to defer the settlement of RSUs upon vesting for tax planning purposes. Deferrals can 
be made to the earlier of (i) the third Wednesday of March of a future year (no sooner than 2026 for the 2024 Program 
RSUs and Prorated Ochoa RSU, or 2028 for the Initial Ochoa RSU) or (ii) the director’s cessation of service or certain 
change-in-control events, in accordance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. 
Other Compensation/Benefits
Our directors are reimbursed for expenses incurred in attending Board and committee meetings, and continuing 
educational programs. We do not offer change-in-control benefits to directors, except for vesting acceleration under our 
equity plans that applies to all plan award holders if an acquirer does not assume or substitute those awards, provided 
that the award holder’s continuous service with us has not terminated prior to the change-in-control. If a director’s 
service terminates due to death, their RSU grants will immediately vest in full. 
Directors do not receive dividends on unvested, or vested but deferred, RSUs.

Review of Transactions with Related Persons
Employees, officers, and directors must avoid any activity that conflicts with, or has the appearance of conflicting with, 
our interests. This policy is included in our Code of Conduct and our Financial Team Code of Conduct. We regularly 
conduct a review of all related party transactions for potential conflicts of interest and all transactions involving 
executive officers or directors must be approved by the NCGC in compliance with the Company’s policies and the Listing 
Standards of The Nasdaq Global Select Market. Except as discussed below, there were no transactions with related 
persons in Fiscal 2025 that would require disclosure in this proxy statement or approval by the NCGC. 
Transactions with Related Persons
The daughter and son of Jen-Hsun Huang, our President and CEO and a member of our Board, are employed by the 
Company. Neither of them shares a household with Mr. Huang, is one of our executive officers, or reports directly to Mr. 
Huang. Additionally, the son of Dr. Shah, one of our directors, has been employed by the Company since February 2024. 
He does not share a household with Dr. Shah and is not one of our executive officers.
The compensation of these individuals was determined in accordance with NVIDIA’s compensation practices applicable to 
employees with comparable qualifications and responsibilities and holding similar positions and without the involvement 
of Mr. Huang or Dr. Shah, respectively. The total compensation for Fiscal 2025 of the daughter and son of Mr. Huang was 
approximately $1,130,000 and $530,000, respectively. The total compensation for Fiscal 2025 of the son of Dr. Shah was 
approximately $475,000.
Each of them has received and continues to be eligible for equity awards on the same general terms and conditions as 
applicable to employees in similar positions who do not have such family relationships.
We have entered into indemnity agreements with our executive officers and directors. The agreements provide that we 
will indemnify them, under certain circumstances, for liabilities they may be required to pay in actions or proceedings by 
reason of their position with NVIDIA, and otherwise to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law, our Charter, and 
our Bylaws. We intend to execute similar agreements with our future executive officers and directors. See Employment, 
Severance, and Change-in-Control Arrangements below for a description of the terms of the 2007 Plan, related to a 
change-in-control of NVIDIA.
During Fiscal 2025, we granted RSUs to our non-employee directors, and RSUs and PSUs to our executive officers (other 
than Mr. Huang, who received PSUs only). See Director Compensation above and Executive Compensation below.

Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management
The following table sets forth information as of March 24, 2025 as to shares of our common stock beneficially owned by 
each of our NEOs, each of our directors, all of our directors and executive officers as a group, and all known by us to be 
beneficial owners of more than 5% of our common stock, unless otherwise indicated in the footnotes to the table. 
Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the SEC’s rules and generally includes voting or investment power 
with respect to securities as well as shares of common stock subject to options exercisable, or PSUs or RSUs that will 
vest, within 60 days of March 24, 2025.
This table is based upon information provided to us by our executive officers and directors. Information about principal 
stockholders, other than percentages of beneficial ownership, is based solely on Schedules 13G/A filed with the SEC. 
Unless otherwise indicated and subject to community property laws where applicable, we believe that each of the 
stockholders named in the table has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares indicated as 
beneficially owned. Percentages are based on 24,456,668,546 shares of our common stock outstanding as of March 24, 
2025, adjusted as required by SEC rules.

Proposal 2—Advisory Approval of Executive Compensation
What am I voting on? A non-binding vote, known as “say-on-pay,” to approve our Fiscal 2025 NEO compensation.
Vote required for approval: A majority of the shares present, in person or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote on 
this matter.
Effect of abstentions: Same as a vote AGAINST.
Effect of broker non-votes: None.
In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are asking our stockholders to vote on an advisory basis, 
commonly referred to as “say-on-pay,” to approve the Fiscal 2025 compensation paid to our NEOs as disclosed in the 
CD&A, the compensation tables and the accompanying narrative discussion. This vote is intended to address the overall 
compensation of our NEOs and the philosophy, policies, and practices described in this proxy statement, rather than any 
specific compensation component.
In response to our stockholders’ preference, our Board has adopted a policy of providing for annual “say-on-pay” votes. 
This advisory proposal is not binding on the Board nor us. Nevertheless, the views expressed by our stockholders are 
important to the Board and, accordingly, the Board and the CC intend to consider the results of this vote in making 
future NEO compensation decisions.
Recommendation of the Board
The Board recommends that our stockholders adopt the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the Fiscal 2025 compensation paid to the Company’s named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant 
to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables, and narrative 
discussion, is hereby APPROVED.”

Executive Compensation
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
This CD&A describes our Fiscal 2025 executive compensation philosophy, design, and process, and how our corporate 
results affected the payout of performance-based awards. Our Fiscal 2025 NEOs were: Jen-Hsun Huang, President and 
CEO; Colette M. Kress, EVP and CFO; Ajay K. Puri, EVP, Worldwide Field Operations; Debora Shoquist, EVP, Operations; and 
Timothy S. Teter, EVP, General Counsel and Secretary.
Fiscal 2025 Executive Compensation Summary
Continued Focus on Pay for Performance 
NVIDIA’s executive compensation program in Fiscal 2025 continued to be guided by a pay for performance philosophy to 
link competitive NEO pay with our stockholders’ interests. Approximately 95% of our CEO’s, and approximately 48% of 
our other NEOs’, total target pay was dependent on corporate performance. 
Executive Pay Heavily Weighted Towards Equity Awards
The vast majority of our NEOs’ total target pay for Fiscal 2025 was comprised of equity awards:
SY PSUs based on annual Non-GAAP Operating Income, vesting over 4 years,
MY PSUs based on 3-year TSR relative to the S&P 500, vesting over 3 years, and
RSUs vesting over 4 years (for NEOs other than our CEO)
(1) Based on total target pay as approved by the CC, consisting of annual base salary, and, assuming the Company achieves associated performance goals 
at a Base Compensation Plan level, target payout opportunity under our Variable Cash Plan and target equity opportunities the CC intended to deliver. 
(2) Reflects the average total target pay mix for our NEOs other than our CEO. The total does not sum to 100% due to rounding. 
NEOs were also eligible for variable cash awards based on annual revenue, in addition to base salary and other 
compensation and benefits.
Key Changes for Fiscal 2025
CEO Cash Compensation Adjustments: increased base salary and variable cash opportunity to align with peers 
and for internal pay equity, after years without changes
Increased Target Equity Opportunities for All NEOs: increased target equity opportunities in recognition of the 
expanding complexity and scope of their roles and responsibilities
Equity Mix Shift for NEOs Other than CEO: adjusted allocation of target equity across RSUs, SY PSUs, and MY 
PSUs for NEOs other than Mr. Huang from 40%, 55%, and 5% in Fiscal 2024 to 50%, 25%, and 25% in Fiscal 2025, 
respectively, to emphasize long-term performance incentives while encouraging retention
Further Increased Rigor of Performance Goals: set Base Compensation Plan for target variable cash and SY PSU 
opportunities well above strong Fiscal 2024 results, and set Threshold goals well above Fiscal 2024 Stretch 
Compensation Plan, to motivate executives
Record Performance Resulting in Maximum Payouts

(1) See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for a reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures and GAAP results.
(2) Represents TSR for purposes of the MY PSU performance goal, calculated using cumulative stock price appreciation with dividends reinvested and the 
average closing stock price for the 60 trading days preceding the start, and preceding and including the last day, of the 3-year performance period.
As a result of the above performance achievements, each exceeding the CC’s pre-established Stretch Compensation Plan 
goals, our NEOs earned the maximum payouts possible for our Fiscal 2025 Variable Cash Plan, SY PSUs granted in Fiscal 
2025, and MY PSUs granted in Fiscal 2023.

Our Compensation Philosophy and Practices
NVIDIA is building a one-of-a-kind company that invents the future, builds amazing technologies, and strives to achieve 
the highest level of craft. To achieve this vision, we must attract and retain a high-caliber executive team while balancing 
our stockholders’ interests. While our CC considers numerous factors in making executive pay decisions, our 
compensation program is guided by the following philosophies:
Pay for Performance: emphasize at-risk and performance-based cash and equity for NEOs based on multiple 
corporate metrics
Provide Competitive Pay: structure competitive NEO target compensation to reflect job impact, scope, and 
responsibilities, that attracts and retains talent
Stockholder Alignment: align NEO pay with stockholders’ long-term interests and consider feedback from our 
annual stockholder engagement efforts and “say-on-pay” vote
Simplicity and Transparency: design a compensation program with simple, objective metrics
In this CD&A, total target pay refers to (i) an NEO’s annual base salary, (ii) target variable cash opportunity, which means 
the potential payout under our Variable Cash Plan, assuming the Company achieves the associated performance goal at a 
Base Compensation Plan level, and (iii) target equity opportunity, which means the value of the equity opportunities 
granted during the year that the CC intended to deliver, assuming the Company achieves associated performance goals 
at a Base Compensation Plan level.
Our executive compensation program adheres to the following practices: 
What We Do
What We Don’t Do
ü Emphasize at-risk, performance-based compensation, 
with simple, objective performance goals
X Enter into agreements with NEOs providing for 
specific terms of employment or severance benefits
ü Use annual and multi-year performance targets to 
determine PSU awards earned
X Give our executive officers special change-in-control 
benefits
ü Set rigorous performance goals and use different 
metrics for annual and multi-year awards
X Provide automatic equity vesting upon a change-incontrol (except for the provisions in our equity plans 
that apply to all employees if an acquiring company

Roles of the CC, Compensation Consultant, and Management
The roles of (i) our CC; (ii) our independent compensation consultant, Exequity; and (iii) management, including our CEO, 
CFO, and Human Resources and Legal departments, are summarized below.
For our Fiscal 2025 NEO compensation program, our CC continued to use Exequity for its experience working with our CC 
and with compensation committees at other technology companies. Our CC analyzed whether Exequity’s role raised any 
conflict of interests, taking into consideration the following: 
Exequity did not provide any services directly to NVIDIA (although we paid Exequity on the CC’s behalf);
The percentage of Exequity’s total revenue resulting from fees paid by us on the CC’s behalf;
Exequity’s conflict of interest policies and procedures;
Any business or personal relationship between Exequity and an executive officer, or between Exequity’s individual 
compensation advisors and an executive officer or any member of our CC; and 
Any NVIDIA stock owned by Exequity or its individual compensation advisors.
After considering these factors, our CC determined that Exequity’s work did not create any conflict of interests.
Our CC reviews and approves all NEO compensation decisions, with input from Mr. Huang and Exequity. At the CC’s 
direction, Exequity and management recommended a peer group for our Fiscal 2025 executive pay program, which the CC 
approved. Management gathered peer data from the Radford Global Technology Survey, or the Radford Survey, which 
informed Exequity’s analysis of Mr. Huang’s compensation, and Mr. Huang’s recommendations for other NEOs. The CC 
considered Exequity’s advice, Mr. Huang’s recommendations, and management’s proposed Fiscal 2025 performance goals 
that were informed by the Company’s operating plan, before making its final decisions on Fiscal 2025 NEO compensation. 
The CC certified compensation payouts for performance periods that concluded at the end of Fiscal 2025 under the 
Variable Cash Plan and for SY PSUs granted in Fiscal 2025 and MY PSUs granted in Fiscal 2023. The CC also oversaw 
management’s Fiscal 2025 compensation risk analysis.
Subsequent to the determination of our Fiscal 2025 executive compensation program, our compensation advisor from 
Exequity retired. In September 2024, the CC engaged Semler Brossy to act as its independent compensation consultant. 
After consideration of the factors outlined above, our CC determined that Semler Brossy’s role did not create any conflict 
of interest.
Peer Companies and Market Compensation Data
We believe our peers should be companies that compete with us for executive talent, have a similar business complexity 
and market presence, and are of comparable size, measured by revenue and market capitalization at approximately 
0.5-3.5x ours. After consulting with management, and based on Exequity’s recommendation, the CC determined in 
November 2023 that the existing peer group remained appropriate for Fiscal 2025, with two adjustments: (i) removing 
Texas Instruments Incorporated due to its revenue and market capitalization falling below our target range, and (ii) adding 
Meta Platforms, Inc. as a competitor for talent with revenue and market capitalization being within our target range: 
Fiscal 2025 Peer Group
Adobe Inc. (ADBE)
Netflix, Inc. (NFLX)
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD)
Oracle Corporation (ORCL)
Broadcom Inc. (AVGO)
Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM)
Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO)
Salesforce, Inc. (CRM)
International Business Machines Corporation (IBM)
SAP SE (SAP)
Intel Corporation (INTC)
Visa Inc. (V)
Meta Platforms, Inc. (META)
Our CC selected each member of the peer group based on a combination of factors described above. As a result, while 
some peer companies fell below our targeted size range, the CC determined they were still appropriate due to their 
established businesses and relevance as competitors for talent. 
To determine our Fiscal 2025 peer group, the CC reviewed our trailing 12-month revenue (reported through our third 
quarter results for Fiscal 2024) and market capitalization as of November 2023. They compared these metrics to the 75th 
percentile, median, and 25th percentile of peer group companies, as follows:

For our NEOs other than our CEO, Mr. Huang reviewed market practices and compensation data from the Radford Survey 
and peer company proxy data for comparable executives before recommending their Fiscal 2025 compensation. The CC 
reviewed the same information for peer companies’ CEOs, before determining the components of our executive 
compensation program, as well as total compensation, for all NEOs. We compared the total compensation opportunity 
for our NEOs and similarly situated executives at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of peer company data where 
available, and the CC considered the factors below in setting NEO compensation.
Factors Used in Determining Executive Compensation
In addition to peer data, our CC considers the following factors in making executive compensation decisions. The weight 
given to each factor may differ among NEOs and each component of pay, and is subject to the CC’s sole discretion.
ü The need to attract and retain talent in a highly 
competitive industry
ü Each NEO’s unvested equity
ü Stockholder feedback regarding our executive pay
ü Internal pay equity relative to similarly situated 
executives
ü The desire for simplicity of the overall program and 
transparency of the performance metrics
ü Our CEO’s recommendations for the other NEOs, 
including his understanding of each NEO’s 
performance, capabilities, and contributions
ü An NEO’s past performance and anticipated future 
contributions
ü Our CC’s independent judgment
ü Our financial performance and forecasted results, as 
well as our prior financial performance and resulting 
impact on our executives’ compensation
ü Our philosophy that an NEO’s total compensation 
opportunity and percentage of at-risk pay should 
increase with responsibility
ü Changes in the scale and complexity of our business
ü The total compensation cost and stockholder dilution, 
including from executive compensation, to maintain a 
responsible cost structure for our compensation 
programs *
ü Each NEO’s current total compensation
ü The scope and complexity of the department(s) or 
function(s) the NEO manages 
* See Note 3, Stock-Based Compensation of our Form 10-K consolidated financial statements for a discussion of stock-based compensation cost.
Fiscal 2025 Compensation Actions and Achievements
Stockholder Outreach and Feedback
We value stockholder feedback and conduct an annual outreach program. In Fall 2023, in preparation for Fiscal 2025 
compensation decisions, we contacted our top institutional stockholders representing an aggregate ownership of 31%. 
Management and the Board, including our Lead Director, met with stockholders holding 14% of our shares to discuss 
topics including executive compensation. Stockholders provided positive feedback on pay versus performance linkage 
and expressed interest in additional performance-based compensation with multi-year performance periods. 
In response to this feedback and considering our 92% say-on-pay approval rate for Fiscal 2023 NEO compensation, our 
CC maintained generally the same elements and performance-based metrics for Fiscal 2025, but (i) increased target 
equity opportunities for all NEOs in recognition of the increased complexity and scope of their roles, (ii) raised Mr. Huang’s 
base salary and target variable cash opportunity for the first time in years, and (iii) shifted the mix of performance-based 
equity more heavily toward MY PSUs. Our CC believed that structuring performance-based components of our executive 
pay program solely around NVIDIA’s financial performance goals continued to align management’s incentives with 
stockholder interests. 

Total Target Compensation Approach
In setting Fiscal 2025 compensation, our CC reviewed each NEO’s total target pay opportunity and distribution across 
multiple pay elements. Our CC compared Mr. Huang’s base salary, target variable cash opportunity, target total cash 
opportunity, target equity opportunity, and total target pay opportunity against chief executives at peer companies. For 
other NEOs, Mr. Huang reviewed their total target pay against similarly situated executives at peer companies where the 
data was available, considering internal pay equity, individual performance, unvested equity levels, and the increasing 
complexity of their roles. These factors informed Mr. Huang’s recommendations to the CC. The CC also considered the 
factors outlined in Factors Used in Determining Executive Compensation and its compensation objectives for Fiscal 2025. 
Rather than applying a formula or assigning specific weights to each factor, our CC used its judgment and experience to 
set total target compensation, the mix of cash and equity, and fixed and at-risk pay opportunities for each NEO. When 
setting pay elements, the CC evaluated them in the context of the levels of the other pay elements and total target pay 
to ensure alignment with program objectives. The CC established amounts and designed a structure to reward NEOs with 
above-market value from equity awards and variable cash incentives only upon exceptional corporate performance.

Our NEOs have insurance benefits and are eligible to participate in our ESPP and 401(k) plan on the same basis as our 
other employees. We also provide limited perquisites to our NEOs from time to time. See Other Compensation and 
Benefits below for more information.
Pay Mix Considerations
For Fiscal 2025, the CC decided that cash compensation would remain constant (other than for Mr. Huang, whose salary 
and target variable cash had not been adjusted in years) and that the largest portion of NEOs’ total target pay would 
remain in the form of at-risk equity. The CC believes an emphasis on long-term, at-risk opportunities drives results and 
increases NEO and stockholder alignment, while providing sufficient annual cash compensation to be competitive and 
retain our NEOs. PSUs and RSUs provide long-term incentives and retention benefits as PSUs require achieving 
predetermined performance goals, and both PSUs and RSUs require longer service (3 years for MY PSUs and 4 years for 
SY PSUs and RSUs) to fully vest.

Given Mr. Huang’s position as CEO, the CC determined that 100% of his equity grants should be at-risk and performancebased, to tightly align his interests with stockholders. Consistent with prior years, the CC split his target equity 
opportunity evenly between SY PSUs (aligned with our annual corporate financial performance) and MY PSUs (aligned 
with our 3-year relative shareholder return). For other NEOs, the CC adjusted the equity mix to increase the weighting of 
target MY PSU opportunity to further align NEO and stockholder long-term interests, resulting in 50% of the target 
equity opportunity granted as RSUs and 50% as PSUs, evenly split between SY and MY PSUs. The CC determined this 
structure balanced performance over short- and long-time horizons while providing a meaningful amount of time-vesting 
RSUs as a retention benefit.
Setting Executive Compensation Values
For Fiscal 2025, the CC decided that increases to each NEO’s total target pay were appropriate in light of the increasing 
scope and complexity of their roles and responsibilities, and internal pay equity considerations.
The CC raised Mr. Huang’s total target pay by $7 million to align more closely with the median of peer company CEOs. 
Specifically, his base salary increased by 50%, to $1.5 million, which aligned with the 75th percentile of peers. The CC 
believed this was appropriate in consideration of internal pay equity with the base salaries of other NEOs and as it 
represented Mr. Huang’s first base salary increase in 10 years. His target variable cash opportunity remained at 200% of 
base salary, increasing to $3 million, which aligned with the median of peers. Mr. Huang’s target equity opportunity 
increased by 25%, to $27.5 million, which aligned slightly above the median of peers. The CC split the target equity 
increase evenly between SY PSUs and MY PSUs to balance short- and long-term performance-based awards.
For other NEOs, the CC similarly adjusted target equity opportunities by $3 to $3.5 million, in recognition of the growing 
scope and complexity of their roles, while maintaining internal pay equity. 
Determining Equity Award Amounts
To determine the actual number of RSUs and target numbers of SY PSUs and MY PSUs awarded to our NEOs, the CC 
divided the value of the target equity they intended to deliver by the 30-calendar day trailing average closing price of our 
common stock ending on the last day of the calendar month prior to the date of grant. They used this methodology 
instead of calculating based on the stock price on the grant date to smooth the effects of possible market volatility. The 
CC understands that using a historical average stock price can cause the ASC 718 grant date value of an award, as 
required to be reported in the Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table, to be different than 
the target equity opportunity. The CC considered various approaches to granting awards and determined the process 
described above is appropriate.
The target number of SY PSUs would become eligible to vest if the Company achieved Fiscal 2025 Non-GAAP Operating 
Income at Base Compensation Plan. If the Company achieved Fiscal 2025 Non-GAAP Operating Income at Stretch 
Compensation Plan or more, the maximum SY PSUs eligible to vest would be capped at 150% of Mr. Huang’s SY PSU 
target equity opportunity and at 200% for other NEOs. If the Company achieved Fiscal 2025 Non-GAAP Operating 
Income at Threshold, the minimum SY PSUs eligible to vest would be 50% of each NEO’s SY PSU target equity 
opportunity.
The target number of MY PSUs would become eligible to vest if the Company achieved TSR relative to the S&P 500 from 
the start of Fiscal 2025 to the end of Fiscal 2027, or the 3-Year Relative TSR, at Base Compensation Plan. If the Company 
achieved 3-Year Relative TSR at Stretch Compensation Plan or more, the maximum MY PSUs eligible to vest would be 
capped at 150% of Mr. Huang’s MY PSU target equity opportunity and at 200% for other NEOs. If the Company achieved 
3-Year Relative TSR at Threshold, the minimum MY PSUs eligible to vest would be 25% of each NEO’s MY PSU target 
equity opportunity.
The CC capped the payout for Mr. Huang’s SY PSUs and MY PSUs at 150% of his target equity opportunity instead of 
200% that applied to other NEOs because all of his Fiscal 2025 equity compensation was performance-based. With these 
caps, Mr. Huang would have the same total upside opportunity on his equity awards as the other NEOs, who had 50% of 
total equity opportunity granted as RSUs that vest based solely on continued service and therefore did not have the same 
upside opportunity.

No PSUs would be eligible to vest if the applicable Threshold performance level was not achieved. Any PSUs determined 
to be unearned would be cancelled.
Performance Metrics and Goals for Executive Compensation
In March 2024, when making decisions regarding Fiscal 2025 executive compensation, the CC intended for performance 
goals to be rigorous, uncertain, and set at levels that would motivate our NEOs, informed by the Company’s Fiscal 2025 
operating plan. As a result, the CC set Base Compensation Plan for Fiscal 2025 revenue and Non-GAAP Operating Income 
well above our record Fiscal 2024 results, and set respective Fiscal 2025 Threshold goals well above the Fiscal 2024 
Stretch Compensation Plan.
Fiscal 2025 performance metrics and goals for NEO pay were as set forth below:

MY PSUs granted in Fiscal 2025 cover the Fiscal 2025 to Fiscal 2027 performance period. MY PSUs covering the Fiscal 2023 to Fiscal 2025 
performance period were granted in Fiscal 2023 and consist of the same performance goal structure and payout opportunities.
Each of the performance goal levels as described above were set by the CC with the following objectives: 
Threshold was uncertain, but attainable and high enough to create value; represented an appropriately decelerated 
payout for performance below Base Compensation Plan.
Base Compensation Plan was uncertain but attainable with significant effort and execution success; included 
budgeted investments in future businesses and revenue growth considering macroeconomic conditions and 
reasonable but challenging growth estimates for ongoing and new businesses.
Stretch Compensation Plan required exceptional achievement; only possible with strong market factors and a very 
high level of management execution and corporate performance.
Fiscal 2025 Performance Achievement
As a result of record performance on strength across all market platforms, led by Data Center demand for our Hopper 
architecture used for large language models, recommendation engines, and generative AI applications, revenue and NonGAAP Operating Income for Fiscal 2025 exceeded their respective Stretch Compensation Plan goals, as did our Fiscal 
2023 to Fiscal 2025 3-year TSR relative to the S&P 500.

In March 2025, the CC certified the Company’s performance achievement with the following payouts:

Revenue is GAAP revenue, as the Company reports in its SEC filings. Non-GAAP Operating Income is GAAP operating income, as the Company reports 
in its SEC filings, excluding stock-based compensation expense, acquisition termination cost, acquisition-related and other costs, restructuring costs 
and other, IP-related and legal settlement costs, and other. Consistent with prior years, 3-year TSR for purposes of the MY PSUs represents cumulative 
stock price appreciation, with dividends reinvested, and is measured based on the average closing stock price for the 60 trading days preceding the 
start, and preceding and including the last day, of the 3-year performance period. This averaging period mitigates the impact of one-day or short-term 
stock price fluctuations at the beginning or end of the performance period.

See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for a reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures and GAAP results.

25% of the eligible SY PSUs vested on March 19, 2025, approximately one year after grant, and 6.25% will vest every quarter thereafter for the next 
three years.
(5)
100% of the eligible MY PSUs vested on March 19, 2025.
Achievement of goals for MY PSUs granted during Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2025 will be determined after the applicable 
performance periods conclude in January 2026 and January 2027, respectively.
Fiscal 2025 Target Compensation Actions and Performance-Based Payouts
The CC’s target Fiscal 2025 compensation actions are summarized below for each NEO, reflecting the target variable cash 
and equity opportunities the CC intended to deliver, as well as the variable cash earned and PSUs which became eligible to 
vest. 
The CC considered the factors set forth in Factors Used in Determining Executive Compensation above to set total target 
pay opportunity for each NEO, which are described in Fiscal 2025 Compensation Actions and Achievements - Setting 
Executive Compensation Values above.
The target equity opportunities presented in the tables below reflect the number of shares underlying each NEO’s equity 
awards granted in Fiscal 2025, calculated by assuming achievement at Base Compensation Plan for PSUs, and 
multiplying by the 30-day trailing average closing price of our common stock that the CC used in approving such equity 
awards, as described above in Determining Equity Award Amounts. These values differ from those reported in the 
Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table, which, in accordance with SEC rules, reflect the 
ASC 718 grant date fair value of each NEO’s equity awards based on the single day closing price of our common stock on 
the date of grant and, for PSUs, assuming a probable outcome of the applicable performance conditions.

Additional Executive Compensation Practices, Policies, and Procedures 
Other Compensation and Benefits
Due to the high profile of our CEO, and in accordance with the Board-approved, independently-assessed executive 
security program, NVIDIA provides Mr. Huang with security protection. In Fiscal 2025, these security arrangements 
included (i) residential security, consultation fees, and driver services, (ii) security monitoring, and (iii) car expenses. Mr. 
Huang’s Fiscal 2025 security costs increased compared to the prior year due to increased travel.
We do not consider these security arrangements to be personal benefits because they arise from Mr. Huang’s duties and 
responsibilities and are required by the Board’s executive security program. However, we are reporting the aggregate 
incremental costs to NVIDIA for security arrangements that are required to be reported in the “All Other Compensation” 
column of the Summary Compensation Table below.
We believe these arrangements and costs are reasonable, necessary and in the best interests of NVIDIA and its 
stockholders, as they enable Mr. Huang to focus on his duties and responsibilities to the Company while reducing security 
threats and mitigating risks to our business. The CC annually oversees the nature and cost of executive security 
measures. When evaluating potential perquisites, we consider many factors, including the cost relative to the anticipated 
business benefit, perceived value to our executives, peer data, as well as corporate governance considerations.
We also provide medical, vision, dental, and accidental death and disability insurance, matches for health savings account 
contributions, as well as paid time off and holidays, for our NEOs on the same basis as our other employees. Our NEOs 
may participate, also on the same basis as our other employees, in our ESPP (unless prohibited by Internal Revenue 
Service rules) and our 401(k) plan, which included a Company match of up to $11,500 for 2024 and 2025. For Fiscal 2025 
(which consisted of most of 2024 and a portion of 2025), our NEOs received the following 401(k) matches: $13,042 for 
Mr. Huang, $14,000 for each of Ms. Kress and Mr. Teter, and $11,500 for each of Mr. Puri and Ms. Shoquist. We believe 
these benefits are consistent with those offered by peers competing for executive talent. In Fiscal 2025, we did not 
provide any other perquisites or other personal benefits to our NEOs.
Equity Grant Timing Practices
The CC approves all equity award grants to our executive officers on or before the grant date. Typically, the CC 
completes its annual executive compensation review, sets performance goals and target compensation, and grants equity 
awards in March. This process is described in How We Determine Executive Compensation above. On occasion, the CC 
may grant equity awards outside of our annual cycle for new hires, promotions, recognition, retention or other purposes. 
While the CC has discretionary authority to approve such awards, it does not have a practice or policy of granting equity 
awards in anticipation of the release of material non-public information. In Fiscal 2025, we did not time the release of 
material non-public information in coordination with equity award grants in a manner that intentionally benefits the value 
of our executive compensation.
Stock Ownership Guidelines
The Board believes that executive officers should hold a significant equity interest in NVIDIA. Since June 2024, our 
Corporate Governance Policies require the CEO to hold shares valued at ten times his base salary, and our other NEOs to 
hold shares valued at three times their respective base salaries. Shares that count toward the ownership guidelines 
include those held directly by the NEO, in trust for the NEO or immediate family, and vested but deferred shares, but not 
unvested equity awards. NEOs have up to five years from appointment to reach their ownership threshold. These 

guidelines are intended to align NEO interests with stockholder interests. Each NEO currently exceeds the stock 
ownership requirements. 
Compensation Recovery Policy
We have maintained a Compensation Recovery Policy since 2009, and amended it in 2023 to comply with Nasdaq’s listing 
standards. Our policy requires the Company to recover certain incentive compensation from current or former executive 
officers in connection with certain restatements of financial statements, if the compensation exceeds the amount that 
the officers would have received based on the restated financial statements, subject to limited exceptions. 
Tax and Accounting Implications
Under Section 162(m), compensation paid to each of the Company’s “covered employees” that exceeds $1 million per year 
is generally non-deductible. The CC considers various factors when making its decisions and retains flexibility to provide 
non-deductible compensation if consistent with the Company’s executive compensation program goals and the best 
interests of the Company and its stockholders. The CC may also modify compensation that was initially intended to be 
exempt from the deduction limit if the modifications are consistent with the Company’s business needs. The CC also 
considers the impact of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and strives to avoid possible adverse tax 
consequences.
Additionally, under ASC 718, the Company records share-based compensation expense for equity compensation over the 
vesting period of the award.
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We believe these non-GAAP financial measures enhance stockholders’ overall understanding of our historical financial 
performance. The presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation nor as a 
substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP financial measures may be 
different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
Compensation Committee Report
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors oversees the compensation programs of NVIDIA on behalf of the 
Board of Directors. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Compensation Committee reviewed and discussed with 
management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis included in this proxy statement.
In reliance on the review and discussions referred to above, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of 
Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of NVIDIA for 
the year ended January 26, 2025 and in this proxy statement.

Risk Analysis of Our Compensation Plans
Under CC oversight, management assessed the Company’s Fiscal 2025 overall compensation programs and policies to 
identify any resulting potential material risks. The assessment focused on programs with payout variability and 
participants’ ability to directly affect payout and related controls—specifically, the Company’s variable cash 
compensation, equity compensation, and sales incentive compensation programs. The review identified key program 
terms and risks, and specific risk mitigation features.
The CC considered these findings and concluded that our compensation programs, which are structured to recognize 
both short-term and long-term contributions to the Company, do not create risks which are reasonably likely to have a 
material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. 
The CC believes that the following compensation design features mitigate against risk: 
Our compensation program encourages our employees to remain focused on both our short-term and longterm goals, and balances incentives by using a mix of base salary and variable pay
We design our variable cash and PSU compensation programs for executives so that payouts are based on 
achievement of various corporate performance targets to balance upside opportunity and downside risk, and 
we cap the potential award payout
We have internal controls over our financial accounting and reporting which are used to measure and 
determine the eligible compensation awards under our Variable Cash Plan and our SY PSUs
Financial plan target goals and final awards under our Variable Cash Plan and SY PSUs are approved by the CC 
and informed by the annual financial plan approved by the Board each year
MY PSUs are designed with a relative goal
We have a compensation recovery policy applicable to executive officers that requires NVIDIA to recover 
certain incentive compensation paid in connection with certain accounting restatements
The CC monitors burn rate and overhang
All executive officer equity awards have multi-year vesting
We have stock ownership guidelines that we believe are reasonable and are designed to align our executive 
officers’ interests with those of our stockholders
Our insider trading policy prohibits hedging, pledging, using margin accounts, and trading in derivatives 
involving our common stock which prevents our employees from insulating themselves from the effects of 
NVIDIA stock price performance

Amounts shown do not reflect dollar amounts actually received by the NEO. Instead, these amounts reflect the aggregate full grant date fair value 
calculated in accordance with ASC 718 for the respective fiscal year for grants of RSUs, SY PSUs, and MY PSUs, as applicable. The assumptions used in 
the calculation of values of the awards are set forth under Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements titled Stock-Based Compensation in our 
Form 10-K. The reported grant date fair value stock awards with performance-based vesting conditions assumes the probable outcome of the 
conditions at Base Compensation Plan for SY PSUs and MY PSUs, determined in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
Assuming Stretch Compensation Plan performance for SY PSUs (including Additional SY PSUs for Fiscal 2024 only) and MY PSUs in each of Fiscal 
2025, 2024, and 2023, and a stock price equal to the grant date fair value of the SY PSUs and MY PSUs, the value of stock awards granted would be:

Amounts shown in this column do not reflect dollar amounts actually received by the NEO. Instead, these amounts reflect the aggregate full grant 
date fair value calculated in accordance with ASC 718 for the awards. The assumptions used in the calculation of values of the awards are set forth 
under Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements titled Stock-Based Compensation in our Form 10-K. With regard to the stock awards with 
performance-based vesting conditions, the reported grant date fair value assumes the probable outcome of the conditions at Base Compensation Plan 
performance for SY PSUs and MY PSUs, determined in accordance with applicable accounting standards.

Employment, Severance, and Change-in-Control Arrangements
Employment Agreements. Our executive officers are “at-will” employees and we do not have employment, severance, or 
change-in-control agreements with our executive officers.
Change-in-Control Arrangements. Our 2007 Plan provides that in the event of a corporate transaction or a change-incontrol, outstanding stock awards may be assumed, continued, or substituted by the surviving corporation. If the 
surviving corporation does not assume, continue, or substitute such stock awards, then (a) with respect to any stock 
awards that are held by individuals performing services for NVIDIA immediately prior to the effective time of the 
transaction, the vesting and exercisability provisions of such stock awards will be accelerated in full and such stock 
awards will be terminated if not exercised prior to the effective date of the corporate transaction or change-in-control, 
and (b) all other outstanding stock awards will be terminated if not exercised on or prior to the effective date of the 
corporate transaction or change-in-control. These change-in-control arrangements apply to stock awards held by our 
NEOs on the same basis as our other employees. 

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control
Upon a change-in-control or certain other corporate transactions of NVIDIA, unvested RSUs, and PSUs will fully vest in 
some cases as described above under Employment, Severance, and Change-in-Control Arrangements—Change-in-Control 
Arrangements. The table below shows our estimates of the amount of the benefit each of our NEOs would have received 
if the unvested RSUs and PSUs held by them as of January 26, 2025 had become fully vested as a result of a change-incontrol, calculated by multiplying the number of unvested RSUs and PSUs held by the applicable NEO by the closing price 
($142.62) of NVIDIA’s common stock on January 24, 2025, the last trading day before the end of our Fiscal 2025, as 
reported by Nasdaq.

Fiscal 2025 and with respect to MY PSUs granted in Fiscal 2023, Fiscal 2024, and Fiscal 2025, in accordance with SEC rules. The two tables below 
reflect the actual numbers of the SY PSUs granted in Fiscal 2025 and MY PSUs granted in Fiscal 2023 that became eligible to vest, based on our 
performance during the relevant performance period for such awards, as certified by our CC shortly after the end of Fiscal 2025. The values of the 
estimated and actual SY PSUs and MY PSUs in the table below were calculated by multiplying the applicable number of SY PSUs and MY PSUs held by 
each respective NEO and listed below, by the closing price ($142.62) of NVIDIA’s common stock on January 24, 2025, the last trading day before the 
end of our Fiscal 2025, as reported by Nasdaq.

The actual number of MY PSUs granted in Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2025 that will become eligible to vest will be determinable after January 25, 2026 and 
January 31, 2027, respectively, the ending dates of the applicable three-year measurement period for MY PSUs. 
Pay Ratio
We determined the ratio of: (a) the annual total compensation of our CEO to (b) the median of the annual total 
compensation of all our employees, except for our CEO, both calculated in accordance with the requirements of Item 
402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K.
Because there have been no changes to our employee population or employee compensation arrangements since the end 
of Fiscal 2024 that would significantly impact our pay ratio disclosure for Fiscal 2025, we used the median employee from 
our Fiscal 2024 pay ratio calculation in our Fiscal 2025 pay ratio calculation. We determined our Fiscal 2024 median 
employee by using a consistently applied compensation measure, which aggregated, for each employee employed by us 
on the last day of Fiscal 2024, or January 28, 2024: (i) target base salary as of January 28, 2024 (annualized for permanent 
employees who were employed by us for less than the entire fiscal year), (ii) variable cash earned during Fiscal 2024, and 
(iii) aggregate full grant date fair value of equity awards granted during Fiscal 2024, calculated in accordance with ASC 
718 and assuming the probable outcome of the conditions at Base Compensation Plan for performance-based awards. 
Compensation paid in foreign currencies was converted to U.S. dollars based on exchange rates in effect on January 28, 
2024. 

Our median employee’s total compensation for Fiscal 2025 was $301,233. Our CEO’s Fiscal 2025 total compensation was 
$49,866,251. Therefore, our Fiscal 2025 CEO to median employee pay ratio was 166:1.
This pay ratio represents a reasonable estimate of the relationship between the compensation of our CEO and that of our 
median employee for Fiscal 2025, calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K and applicable 
guidance, which provide significant flexibility in how companies identify the median employee. Each company may use a 
different methodology, apply different exclusions, and make different assumptions. As a result, the pay ratio reported by 
other companies may not be comparable to ours. 
Pay Versus Performance
NVIDIA’s executive compensation program is guided by a pay for performance philosophy and is designed to align NEO 
pay with our stockholders’ interests. Accordingly, a substantial portion of our NEOs’ total compensation is based on the 
Company’s performance under certain corporate financial metric goals, which for Fiscal 2025 included annual revenue, 
annual Non-GAAP Operating Income, and 3-year TSR relative to the S&P 500. 
Amounts set forth below as “compensation actually paid,” or CAP, have been calculated in accordance with Item 402(v) of 
Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, and do not represent the value of compensation actually paid to or received by 
our NEOs. For a discussion of our executive compensation program and philosophy, refer to our CD&A above.
The following table summarizes information regarding compensation for our NEOs, including CAP as well as certain 
financial performance metrics, during Fiscal 2021-2025. Fiscal 2022-2025 were 52-week years. Fiscal 2021 was a 53week year.

reported in our Summary Compensation Table above for Fiscal 2025.
(b) The equity award adjustments were calculated in accordance with the SEC methodology for determining CAP for each year shown. The amounts in 
these columns were determined by reference to (i) for MY PSU awards where the performance period was complete as of or prior to the applicable 
year end date and for SY PSU awards, the closing price of our common stock on the applicable year end date, as reduced by the present value of 
dividends expected to be paid on the underlying shares during the requisite service period, or the closing price of our common stock on the 
applicable vesting dates, and (ii) for MY PSU awards where the performance period was not yet complete as of the applicable year end date, the fair 
value as calculated by a Monte Carlo simulation model as of the respective year end date, for the listed fiscal years.
(c) The valuation assumptions used to calculate fair values did not materially differ from those disclosed at the time of grant.

for our non-CEO NEOs as reported in our Summary Compensation Table above for Fiscal 2025.
(b) The equity award adjustments were calculated in accordance with the SEC methodology for determining CAP for each year shown. The amounts in 
these columns were determined by reference to (i) for MY PSU awards where the performance period was complete as of or prior to the applicable 
year end date, for RSU awards and for SY PSU awards, the closing price of our common stock on the applicable year end date, as reduced by the 
present value of dividends expected to be paid on the underlying shares during the requisite service period, or the closing price of our common 
stock on the applicable vesting dates, and (ii) for MY PSU awards where the performance period was not yet complete as of the applicable year end 
date, the fair value as calculated by a Monte Carlo simulation model as of the respective year end date, for the listed fiscal years.
(c) The valuation assumptions used to calculate fair values did not materially differ from those disclosed at the time of grant. 
(7) TSR for each of the years during Fiscal 2021-2025 is cumulative, reflecting the value of a fixed $100 investment beginning with the market close on 
January 24, 2020, the last trading day before our Fiscal 2021, through and including the end of the respective listed fiscal years.

for purposes of determining executive compensation is discussed above in CD&A.
(9) Our Company-Selected Measure, as required by Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K, is Non-GAAP Operating Income, which, in our assessment, represents the 
most important financial performance measure linking Fiscal 2025 NEO CAP to company performance. See Definitions above for a definition of NonGAAP Operating Income, and see Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures above in CD&A for a reconciliation between GAAP operating income and 
non-GAAP Operating Income.

Proposal 3—Ratification of the Selection of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for Fiscal 2026
What am I voting on? Ratification of the selection of PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm for 
Fiscal 2026.
Vote required for approval: A majority of the shares present, in person or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote on 
this matter.
Effect of abstentions: Same as a vote AGAINST.
Effect of broker non-votes: Not applicable (because this is a routine proposal, there are no broker non-votes).
The AC has selected PwC, which has audited our financial statements annually since 2004, to serve as our independent 
registered public accounting firm for Fiscal 2026. Our lead audit partner at PwC will serve no more than five consecutive 
years in that role. Stockholder ratification of the AC’s selection of PwC is not required by our Bylaws. As a matter of good 
corporate governance, we are submitting the selection of PwC to our stockholders for ratification. If our stockholders do 
not ratify the selection, the AC will reconsider whether or not to retain PwC. Even if the selection is ratified, the AC in its 
sole discretion may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time 
during the fiscal year if it determines that such a change would be in our best interests and those of our stockholders. 
The AC believes it is in the best interests of NVIDIA and our stockholders to retain PwC.
We expect that a representative of PwC will attend the 2025 Meeting. The PwC representative will have an opportunity 
to make a statement at the 2025 Meeting if he or she so desires and will also be available to respond to appropriate 
stockholder questions.
Recommendation of the Board
The Board recommends that you vote FOR the ratification of the selection of PwC as our independent registered 
accounting firm for our fiscal year ending January 25, 2026.

All services provided for Fiscal 2025 and 2024 described above were pre-approved by the AC or the AC Chairperson 
through the authority granted to him by the AC, which is described below. Our AC determined that the rendering of 
services other than audit services by PwC was compatible with maintaining PwC’s independence.
Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures
The AC has adopted policies and procedures for the pre-approval of all audit and permissible non-audit services rendered 
by our independent registered public accounting firm. The policy generally permits pre-approvals of specified permissible 
services in the defined categories of audit services, audit-related services, and tax services up to specified amounts. Preapproval may also be given as part of the AC’s approval of the scope of the engagement of our independent registered 
public accounting firm or on an individual case-by-case basis before the independent registered public accounting firm is 
engaged to provide each service. In some cases, the full AC provides pre-approval for up to a year related to a particular 
defined task or scope. In other cases, the AC has delegated power to the AC Chairperson to pre-approve additional audit 
and non-audit services if the need for the service was unanticipated and approval is required prior to the next scheduled 
meeting of the AC. The AC Chairperson then communicates such pre-approval to the full AC at its next meeting. 

Report of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors
The material in this report is not “soliciting material,” is not deemed “filed” with the SEC, and is not to be incorporated by 
reference in any of our filings under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, whether made before or after the date hereof and 
irrespective of any general incorporation language in any such filing, except to the extent specifically incorporated by 
reference therein.
The Audit Committee, or AC, oversees accounting, financial reporting, internal control over financial reporting, financial 
practices, and audit activities of NVIDIA and its subsidiaries. The AC reviews the results and scope of the audit and other 
services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm and reviews financial statements and the 
accounting policies followed by NVIDIA prior to the issuance of the financial statements with both management and the 
independent registered public accounting firm.
Management is responsible for the financial reporting process, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in 
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, the system of internal control 
over financial reporting, and the procedures designed to facilitate compliance with accounting standards and applicable 
laws and regulations. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, or PwC, our independent registered public accounting firm for Fiscal 
2025, was responsible for performing an independent audit of the consolidated financial statements and issuing a report 
on the consolidated financial statements and of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of 
January 26, 2025. PwC’s judgments as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of our accounting principles and such 
other matters are required to be disclosed to the AC under applicable standards. The AC oversees these processes. Also, 
the AC has ultimate authority and responsibility to select, evaluate and, when appropriate, terminate the independent 
registered public accounting firm. The AC approves audit fees and non-audit services provided by and fees paid to the 
independent registered public accounting firm.

evaluating the adequacy, effectiveness, and quality of our system of internal controls and the operating effectiveness of 
our business processes. The AC approves an annual internal audit plan and monitors the activities and performance of 
our internal audit function throughout the year to ensure the plan objectives are carried out and met.
The AC members are not professional accountants or auditors, and their functions are not intended to duplicate or to 
certify the activities of management or the independent registered public accounting firm. The AC does not plan or 
conduct audits, determine that our financial statements are complete and accurate and in accordance with GAAP, or 
assess our internal control over financial reporting. The AC relies, without additional independent verification, on the 
information provided by our management and on the representations made by management that the financial 
statements have been prepared with integrity and objectivity, and the opinion of PwC that such financial statements 
have been prepared in conformity with GAAP.
In this context, the AC reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements for Fiscal 2025 with 
management and our internal control over financial reporting with management and PwC. Specifically, the AC discussed 
with PwC the matters required to be discussed by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting 
Oversight Board and the SEC. We have received from PwC the written disclosures and letter required by the applicable 
requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding PwC’s communications with the AC 
concerning independence. The AC also considered whether the provision of certain permitted non-audit services by PwC 
is compatible with PwC’s independence and discussed PwC’s independence with PwC. 
Based on the AC’s review and discussions, the AC recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited consolidated 
financial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of NVIDIA for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025.

Proposal 4—Approval of an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to Remove All 
Supermajority Provisions
What am I voting on? Approval of an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to remove all supermajority 
provisions. 
Vote required: Sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of 
voting stock of the corporation, voting together as a single class. 
Effect of abstentions: Same as a vote AGAINST. 
Effect of broker non-votes: Same as a vote AGAINST. 
Background 
At the 2024 Meeting, our stockholders approved a non-binding stockholder proposal requesting the Board eliminate 
supermajority voting provisions in our Charter and Bylaws. The Board of Directors made no recommendation with respect 
to the proposal in order to fully understand the viewpoints of our stockholders on the matter. After due deliberation and 
engagement with stockholders, the Board approved, adopted and declared advisable an amendment and restatement of 
our Charter to eliminate the remaining supermajority voting provisions described herein, eliminate inoperative provisions 
relating to a previously effected forward stock split and the completed declassification of our Board, and implement 
other non-substantive clarifying changes, subject to stockholder approval. The full text of the Proposed Charter is set 
forth in Appendix A to this proxy statement with proposed new text underlined and proposed deletions crossed out. The 
Board also intends to approve conforming amendments to our Bylaws, contingent upon stockholder approval of this 
Proposal 4. 
Description of the Proposed Charter Amendments 
Article V, paragraph A(3) of the Charter provides that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and twothirds percent of the voting power of the voting stock of the corporation then outstanding shall be required to remove 
directors without cause. 
Article V, paragraph B(1) of the Charter provides that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and twothirds percent of the voting power of the voting stock of the corporation then outstanding shall be required to alter, 
amend or adopt new Bylaws. 
Article VII, paragraph B of the Charter provides that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds 
percent of the voting power of the voting stock of the corporation then outstanding shall be required to alter, amend or 
repeal the following Articles: 
Article V, which relates to composition and election of the Board, amendments of the Bylaws, and stockholder 
action by written consent;
Article VI, which relates to exculpation for violations of the duty of care by directors; and
Article VII, which relates to amendments of the Charter, including supermajority vote requirement for 
amendments to Articles V, VI, and VII. 
Assuming the Proposed Charter is approved by our stockholders and becomes effective: 
Article V, paragraph A(3) will be amended to provide that the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the 
voting power of all the then outstanding shares of voting stock, entitled to vote at an election directors, shall be 
required to remove directors without cause (the same vote currently applicable to removal for cause); 
Article V, paragraph B(1) will be amended to provide that amendments to the Bylaws will require the affirmative 
vote of a majority of the voting power of all the then outstanding shares of voting stock, entitled to vote thereon; 
and 
Article VII, paragraph B will be eliminated, such that amendments to Articles V, VI, and VII of the Charter will 
require the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of all the then outstanding shares of voting stock, 
entitled to vote thereon. 
In addition, once effective, the Proposed Charter would eliminate inoperative provisions relating to a previously effected 
forward stock split and the completed declassification of our Board, as well as implement other non-substantive 
clarifying changes. 
Recommendation of the Board 
The Board recommends that you vote FOR the approval of the Proposed Charter. 

Effective Date of Proposed Charter 
If our stockholders adopt and approve this Proposal 4, we anticipate that the Proposed Charter will be filed with the 
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and become effective on or around July 1, 2025. 
Reservation of Rights 
Our Board reserves the right to decide, in its sole discretion, not proceed with and abandon the filing of the Proposed 
Charter without further action by our stockholders at any time before the effectiveness of such filing with the Secretary 
of State of the State of Delaware, even if this Proposal 4 is adopted and approved by our stockholders at the 2025 
Meeting. If the Board determines to exercise this discretion, we will publicly disclose this fact and the reasons for such 
determination. 

Stockholder Proposals
We will promptly furnish the address and, to our knowledge, the number of shares held by the stockholder proponents of 
the proposals below upon receipt of a request to our Secretary for such information at email to 
shareholdermeeting@nvidia.com or by phone at: (408) 486-2000. 
Proposal 5—Stockholder Proposal: Special Shareholder Meeting Improvement
What am I voting on? A stockholder proposal to eliminate the one-year holding period requirement to call a special 
stockholder meeting. 
Vote required: A majority of the shares present, in person or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote on this matter. 
Effect of abstentions: Same as a vote AGAINST. 
Effect of broker non-votes: None. 
Below is a stockholder proposal and supporting statement of the stockholder proponent, for which we and our Board 
accept no responsibility. This stockholder proposal is required to be voted upon at the 2025 Meeting only if properly 
presented. Our Board opposes adoption of this stockholder proposal and recommends that you vote AGAINST Proposal 
5. John Chevedden has notified us of his intent to present the following proposal at the 2025 Meeting. 
Stockholder Proposal and Supporting Statement 
Proposal 5 – Special Shareholder Meeting Improvement 
Shareholders ask our Board of Directors to take the steps necessary to remove the current provision that considers the 
voice of certain NVDA shareholders as non-shareholders. Currently all NVDA shares held for less than one continuous year 
are considered non-shareholders if they seek to call for a special shareholder meeting on an important matter. 
The current exclusion of all NVDA shares held for less than one continuous year makes the current so-called shareholder 
right to call for a special shareholder meeting useless. There is no point to have a useless right on the books of NVDA. 
The reason to enable all shareholders to call for a special shareholder meeting is to allow one shareholder or a group of 
shareholders to quickly acquire NVDA shares to equal the challenging 15% share ownership requirement, based on all 
shares outstanding, to call for a special shareholder meeting to incentivize a turnaround of NVDA should NVDA find itself 
in a slump in the future. 
The best strategies for turning around a company do not necessarily come from a company’s existing shareholders. 
If NVDA finds itself in a future slump, NVDA shareholders and potential NVDA shareholders will not even consider 
acquiring more shares in order to call for a special shareholder meeting, if they have to wait one-year to call for a special 
shareholder meeting. A one-year holding period makes no sense. A slumping stock price demands an immediate response. 
The fact that one shareholder or a group of shareholders can quickly acquire more shares to call for a special shareholder 
meeting is an incentive for NVDA Directors to avoid a slump in the first place since the continued service of the least 
qualified NVDA Directors could be terminated by a special shareholder meeting. This is a good incentive for the NVDA 
Directors to have for the benefit of all NVDA shareholders. 
At minimum this proposal alerts shareholders to the severe limitation, to the point of uselessness, baked into the current 
NVDA rules for shareholders to call for a special shareholder meeting. 
Please vote yes: 
Special Shareholder Meeting Improvement – Proposal 5 

Opposing Statement of the Board 
Our Board recommends a vote AGAINST Proposal 5 because it believes it is unnecessary and not in the best interests of 
NVIDIA and our stockholders. 
We already provide a meaningful and balanced special meeting right. 
Our Board recognizes the importance of allowing stockholders to call special meetings when needed. In 2024, we 
amended our Bylaws to let stockholders owning at least 15% of our shares for a minimum of one year request a special 
meeting. Since then, we’ve engaged with many of our largest stockholders and none raised concerns about the one-year 
holding period. Removing this requirement could allow a minority of stockholders who have not held a financial stake in 
NVIDIA for a meaningful period of time to call special meetings and waste NVIDIA’s resources, ultimately harming our 
stockholders. The current special meeting right strikes a balance between enabling urgent action and protecting NVIDIA 
and its stockholders from narrow, short-term interests. 
Special meetings demand substantial time, effort, and management resources, and our one-year holding period is a 
reasonable safeguard. 
Given NVIDIA’s scale and broad stockholder base, calling a special meeting entails significant resource commitments. The 
associated legal, administrative and voting processes are time intensive and divert the Board and management from core 
business operations, potentially impacting stockholder value. Therefore, the Board believes special meetings should be 
limited to urgent, extraordinary matters initiated by stockholders with a substantial, long-term financial interest in the 
company. 
The one-year holding period is consistent with the SEC’s minimum for stockholders to include a proposal in our proxy 
statement. 
SEC Rule 14a-8 permits stockholders to include proposals in a company’s proxy statement after holding shares for at 
least one year, reflecting the principle that proponents should have an economic stake for a meaningful time period 
before using company and stockholder resources. This same rationale underpins our one-year holding requirement for 
requesting special meetings. Moreover, under Rule 14a-8, stockholders with minimal holdings may still submit proposals 
for annual meetings. 
We are committed to strong governance and stockholder accountability. 
The Board is committed to best practices and regularly updates its policies based on evolving standards and stockholder 
input. These efforts, along with the right to call special meetings, reflect our commitment to effective oversight and 
engagement: 
Active Stockholder Engagement. We engage stockholders year-round on governance, sustainability, risk 
oversight, and compensation. 
Annual Elections and Majority Voting. Directors are elected annually and must receive majority support under our 
Bylaws.
Meaningful Stockholder Rights. We offer proxy access, director nomination rights, and do not maintain a 
stockholder rights plan.
Independent, Refreshed Board. 92% of our directors are independent, including our Lead Director and all 
committee members; and four new directors have joined since 2020.
Responsive Governance Reforms. Following stockholder approval, we plan to implement the removal of 
supermajority voting provisions.
Our Board believes the current special meeting right, including the one-year holding requirement, is appropriate. Proposal 
5 is viewed as unnecessary, potentially disruptive, and not in the best interests of NVIDIA or its stockholders. 
Recommendation of the Board 
Our Board recommends that you vote AGAINST Proposal 5—Special Shareholder Meeting Improvement. 

Proposal 6—Stockholder Proposal: Director Election Resignation Governance Policy
What am I voting on? A stockholder proposal to request the adoption of a new director election resignation policy. 
Vote required: A majority of the shares present, in person or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote on this matter. 
Effect of abstentions: Same as a vote AGAINST. 
Effect of broker non-votes: None. 
Below is a stockholder proposal and supporting statement of the stockholder proponent, for which we and our Board 
accept no responsibility. This stockholder proposal is required to be voted upon at the 2025 Meeting only if properly 
presented. Our Board opposes adoption of this stockholder proposal and recommends that you vote AGAINST Proposal 
6. The New York City Carpenters Pension Fund has notified us of its intent to present the following proposal at the 2025 
Meeting. 
Stockholder Proposal and Supporting Statement  
Proposal 6 – Director Election Resignation Governance Policy 
Resolved: The shareholders of NVIDIA Corporation ("Company") request that the Board adopt a new Director Election 
Resignation Governance Policy ("Resignation Policy") provision in its corporate governance principles to address those 
situations when one or more incumbent Board nominees fail to receive the required majority vote for re-election. The 
Resignation Policy shall provide that each director upon joining the Board tender an irrevocable resignation conditioned 
on the director's failure to receive the required majority vote support in an uncontested election. The Resignation Policy 
shall provide that the Board should accept a director's tendered resignation absent its finding of a compelling reason or 
reasons to reject the resignation, as decided by the Board in the exercise of its business judgment. The Resignation Policy 
shall further stipulate that if the Board rejects a director's resignation and the director remains on the Board as a 
"holdover" director but is not re-elected at the next annual meeting of shareholders, that such director's second tendered 
resignation shall be effective ninety days after the vote certification. 
Supporting Statement: The Resignation Policy sets a new demanding director resignation governance guideline to reflect 
shareholder voting sentiment in director elections. Delaware corporate law states that each director shall hold office until 
such director's successor is elected and qualified or until such director's earlier resignation or removal. An incumbent 
director who does not receive the required vote for election may continue to serve as a "holdover" director. The 
Company's current director resignation bylaw requires incumbent directors to tender a resignation if they do not receive 
the requisite vote to be re-elected in an uncontested annual election. Directors on the Board's Nominating and Corporate 
Governance Committee will then review the tendered resignation and recommend to the Board whether to accept or 
reject it. 
The proposed Resignation Guideline Policy sets a more demanding director resignation review process, requiring the 
Board to articulate a compelling reason or reasons when it rejects a tendered resignation, thus allowing an unelected 
director to continue to serve. Importantly, the Resignation Policy further establishes that if a "holdover" director again 
fails to be re-elected at the next annual meeting of shareholders, the new resignation is effective ninety days following 
the election vote certification. While the Guideline Resignation Policy provides the Board latitude to reject the first 
resignation of an incumbent director who does not receive majority vote support, it honors the shareholder vote as the 
final word on a "holdover" director's second election defeat. 
Shareholder director election voting rights under Delaware corporate law are foundational rights in the governance of 
corporations. The majority vote director election standard adopted by the Company gives shareholders voting rights that 
have legal effect. It is important that corporate director resignation policies, guidelines and bylaws not undermine 
shareholder voting rights. The proposed Resignation Policy establishes shareholder voting in director elections as a more 
consequential governance right, striking a proper balance between board discretion and shareholder voting rights. 

Opposing Statement of the Board 
Our Board recommends a vote AGAINST Proposal 6 because it believes it is unnecessary and not in the best interests of 
NVIDIA and our stockholders.   
Our Bylaws and governance policies already provide an effective remedy for nominees not receiving a majority vote. 
Directors who do not receive majority support must offer their resignation, which the NCGC reviews and then 
recommends to the Board. The Board must act on the recommendation within 90 days, publicly disclosing its decision and 
reasoning. This process allows the Board to consider all factors in determining what is best for NVIDIA and its 
stockholders, ensuring appropriate discretion and judgment. 
The proposal would unduly restrict and undermine the role of the Board in exercising its judgment. 
Proposal 6 requires automatic resignation if a director fails to receive majority support for two consecutive years. This 
would undermine the Board’s ability to make informed decisions, regardless of circumstances. No other major U.S. 
company has adopted the policy requested in the Proposal, and such a policy is out of step with market practice. Our 
current policies provide for the Board to engage with stockholders and apply reasoned judgment to evaluate next steps. 
This measured approach ensures stability and continuity, avoiding disruptions to the Board’s functions while respecting 
stockholder input. 
Our stockholders have consistently shown strong support for our director nominees. 
Stockholders consistently support NVIDIA’s director nominees, as shown by high vote percentages and positive feedback 
during annual meetings and outreach. In the past ten years, nominees have averaged 97.2% support. NVIDIA’s robust 
stockholder engagement program allows for ongoing dialogue, ensuring the Board is aware of stockholder views. 
Our corporate governance policies ensure Board accountability and responsiveness to stockholder concerns. 
Our governance practices, including regular stockholder outreach, annual director elections, and independent board 
leadership, already ensure accountability and responsiveness. In addition, the Board has taken steps to continue board 
refreshment, support elimination of supermajority voting provisions (Proposal 4), and maintain a market-standard proxy 
access bylaw provision. 
The Board believes that Proposal 6’s restrictive provisions are unnecessary, potentially harmful, and not in the best 
interests of NVIDIA and its stockholders. 
Recommendation of the Board 
Our Board recommends that you vote AGAINST Proposal 6—Director Election Resignation Governance Policy. 

Proposal 7—Stockholder Proposal: Workforce Data Reporting
What am I voting on? A stockholder proposal to request workforce public reporting to include EEOC job categories. 
Vote required: A majority of the shares present, in person or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote on this matter. 
Effect of abstentions: Same as a vote AGAINST. 
Effect of broker non-votes: None. 
Below is a stockholder proposal and supporting statement of the stockholder proponent, for which we and our Board 
accept no responsibility. This stockholder proposal is required to be voted upon at the 2025 Meeting only if properly 
presented. Our Board opposes adoption of this stockholder proposal and recommends that you vote AGAINST Proposal 
7. Trillium ESG Global Equity Fund has notified us of its intent to present the following proposal at the 2025 Meeting.
Stockholder Proposal and Supporting Statement  
Proposal 7 – Workforce Data Reporting 
RESOLVED: Shareholders request that NVIDIA Corporation enhance existing public reporting, at reasonable cost and 
omitting confidential information, to include a chart identifying employees according to gender and race in each of the 
nine Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)-defined job categories, listing either numbers or percentages in 
each category. 
WHEREAS: 
As of the filing date of this shareholder proposal, NVIDIA has decreased its workforce data transparency from previous 
years, which may prevent investors from assessing its workforce trends or efficacy of workplace culture and talent 
management programs. 
For example, NVIDIA consistently disclosed EEO-1 data between 2018 through 2021 but has seemingly reversed course 
and has not disclosed data from 2022 through the present. Market standards and stakeholder expectations, however, 
have significantly changed around such disclosures. As of April 2024, over 80 percent of the S&P 500 and nearly 50 
percent of the Russell 1000 Index companies disclose EEO-1 data, establishing this as best practice in workforce data 
reporting.1 NVIDIA’s change in practice has furthermore led to it lagging peers in disclosures. In comparison to NVIDIA, 
Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, Broadcom, and Qualcomm release EEO-1 data. 
Investors need annual disclosure of granular workforce data to determine whether investments in workplace culture and 
talent management programs have translated to measurable impacts at various levels of the company. The 
comprehensive, consistent, and standardized nature of EEO-1 data disclosure also facilitates comparison across firms. As 

workforce without additional burdens on the company to collect data. 
Workplace culture and human capital management programs are critical to a company’s talent attraction and retention 
pipeline, which may affect both social equality and financial performance.2 As You Sow and Whistle Stop Capital reviewed 
the workforce diversity of 1,641 companies between 2016-2021, finding statistically significant positive correlations 
between manager diversity and return on equity, return on invested capital, and 10-year revenue growth, among other 
indicators.3 
Implementing more robust reporting via the disclosure of EEO-1 data would provide transparency and insight to 
investors, employees, and stakeholders. Further, comparing the data collected to internal and external standards and 
peers may enhance talent management, workplace culture strategy, and promote employee retention. Subsequent 
disclosures around these activities would enable investors to better understand and assess NVIDIA’s human capital 
management trends and performance.

Opposing Statement of the Board
Our Board recommends a vote AGAINST Proposal 7 because it believes it is unnecessary and not in the best interests of 
NVIDIA and our stockholders. 
We publish robust workforce and diversity data. 
The Board agrees that “workplace culture and human capital management programs are critical to a company’s talent 
attraction and retention pipeline,” and believes our employees are our greatest asset. Consequently, the Board has long 
supported NVIDIA’s human capital programs and extensive workforce-related disclosures. 
For example, NVIDIA’s 2024 Sustainability Report contains: 
Fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022 workforce data on geographic regions, employee type, age, gender, positions held by 
women, and race/ethnicity (U.S.), disability, and veterans. 
Detailed hiring data by age, gender, region, and race/ethnicity (U.S.). 
Pay ratios of women to men, Asian to White, Black/African American to White, and Hispanic/Latino to White, 
along with annual turnover rate statistics by gender and race/ethnicity (U.S.). 
Expansive discussions of NVIDIA’s workforce initiatives, such as community resource groups, learning and 
development programs, employee engagement, mentorship, and our benefits and compensation programs. 
The Board is proud of NVIDIA’s human capital accomplishments and the success of our employees in creating long-term 
value for our stakeholders. For example, NVIDIA continues to be among America’s best places to work, ranking fourth on 
Glassdoor’s list of best employers for 2025. 
We believe the requested disclosures are not suited to our business. 
Proposal 7 suggests our reporting is deficient because we have not tailored our workforce disclosure to report on gender 
and race according to the specific job categories used by the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for 
EEO-1 Component 1 reporting. These nine broadly defined roles, including “first/mid-level officials and managers,” “craft 
workers,” “operatives,” and “laborers and helpers,” are generic categories applicable to all business types across the U.S. 
For example, the “operative” category includes jobs as diverse as laundry workers, weaving machine operators, bakers, 
and poultry and fish processing workers. These categories are designed for employers with more than 100 employees and 
are not suited for describing NVIDIA’s workforce. Publishing data based on generic categories is uninformative and may 
create confusion regarding our workforce, operations, and human capital practices. 
Our workforce disclosures are used by our stockholders and other stakeholders as an important tool for understanding 
our business. We take great care in selecting and preparing the most relevant and useful data for these audiences. The 
Board believes our stockholders are best served by publishing workforce disclosures based on metrics and categories 
most relevant to our business and stakeholders, such as the detailed datapoints in our sustainability reports. 
Our management is well-positioned to determine the most appropriate workforce reporting metrics. 
The Board believes NVIDIA’s management, supported by our Corporate Sustainability team and overseen by the CC and 
NCGC, as applicable, is best positioned to assess the most appropriate workforce metrics to be published. 
In 2024, NVIDIA launched a Corporate Sustainability Steering Committee of our executives to oversee our Corporate 
Sustainability team and guide our sustainability strategy and program, in collaboration with the Board and NCGC. The 
Corporate Sustainability team designs and implements NVIDIA’s extensive public disclosures, including NVIDIA’s annual 
sustainability report, which is guided by leading disclosure frameworks. The Corporate Sustainability team strives to 
incorporate stockholder feedback and conducts regular outreach to solicit input and provide updates on progress. 
Given management’s awareness of stockholder priorities and understanding of our business and workforce, the Board 
believes Proposal 7’s imposition of potentially misleading reporting requirements is inappropriate and unhelpful to our 
stockholders and other stakeholders. 
Recommendation of the Board
Our Board recommends that you vote AGAINST Proposal 7—Workforce Data Reporting.

prices based on the applicable offering date prices, and the $25,000 limit under Section 423(b)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code.
During Fiscal 2025, we granted an aggregate of 82,467,905 shares under our 2007 Plan in the form of RSUs and PSUs, 
1,655,590 of which were granted to our NEOs, 26,137 of which were granted to our non-employee directors, and

Additional Information
Delinquent Section 16(a) Reports
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers, directors and persons who own more than 10% of a 
registered class of our equity securities to file initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our 
common stock and other equity securities with the SEC. Executive officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders 
are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. To our knowledge, based 
solely on a review of the copies of such reports furnished to us and written representations that no other reports were 
required, all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to individuals who were, during Fiscal 2025, our executive 
officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners were complied with, except for Dr. Drell, who did not file two 
Forms 4 with respect to two transactions, both of which were reported on a Form 5. 
Other Matters
The Board knows of no other matters that will be presented for consideration at the 2025 Meeting. If any other matters

APPENDIX A
AMENDED AND RESTATED
CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION 

(Originally incorporated on February 24, 1998 
under the name NVIDIA Delaware Corporation)
The name of this corporation is NVIDIA Corporation.
II.
The address of the registered office of the corporation in the State of Delaware is 251 Little Falls Drive, 
City of Wilmington, County of New Castle 19808, and the name of the registered agent of the corporation in the State of 
Delaware at such address is Corporation Service Company.
Ill.
The purpose of this corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which a corporation may be 
organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
IV.
This corporation is authorized to issue two classes of stock to be designated, respectively, 
“Common Stock” and “Preferred Stock.” The total number of shares which the corporation is authorized to issue is Eighty 
Billion Two Million (80,002,000,000) shares. Eighty Billion (80,000,000,000) shares shall be Common Stock, each having a 
par value of one-tenth of one cent ($.001). Two Million (2,000,000) shares shall be Preferred Stock, each having a par value 
of one-tenth of one cent ($.001).
At the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock issued as of immediately prior to the Effective Time 
shall be automatically subdivided and reclassified into ten (10) validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of 
Common Stock, without any further action by the Corporation or the holder thereof (the “Stock Split”). Each certificate 
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Common Stock shall thereafter represent that 
number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Common Stock represented by such certificate shall have 
been subdivided and reclassified pursuant to the Stock Split.
The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. The Board of Directors is 
hereby authorized, by filing a certificate (a “Preferred Stock Designation”) pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation 
Law, to fix or alter from time to time the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such series 
and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of any wholly unissued series of Preferred Stock, and to establish from 
time to time the number of shares constituting any such series or any of them; and to increase or decrease the number 
of shares of any series subsequent to the issuance of shares of that series, but not below the number of shares of such 
series then outstanding. In case the number of shares of any series shall be decreased in accordance with the foregoing 
sentence, the shares constituting such decrease shall resume the status that they had prior to the adoption of the 
resolution originally fixing the number of shares of such series.
For the management of the business and for the conduct of the affairs of the Ccorporation, and in 
further definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the Ccorporation, of its directors and of its stockholders or 
any class thereof, as the case may be, it is further provided that:
The management of the business and the conduct of the affairs of the Ccorporation 
shall be vested in its Board of Directors. The number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board of Directors shall 
be fixed exclusively by one or more resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors.
Subject to the other provisions of this paragraph, the Board of Directors is and shall 
remain divided into three classes, with the directors in each class serving for a term expiring at the third annual meeting 
of stockholders held after their election. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect 
additional directors under specified circumstances, the terms of the members of the Board of Directors shall be as 
follows: (i) at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2012, the directors whose terms expire at that meeting or 
such directors' successors shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders to be 
held in 2013; (ii) at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2013, the directors whose terms expire at that 
meeting or such directors' successors shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of 
stockholders to be held in 2014; and (iii) at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2014 and at each annual 
meeting of stockholders thereafter, all directors shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the next annual 
meeting of stockholders. The classification of the Board of Directors shall terminate at the annual meeting of 
stockholders to be held in 2014 and all directors shall be elected in accordance with clause (iii) above.
A-1

Each Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article, each director shall serve until his 
successor is duly elected and qualified or until his death, resignation or removal. No decrease in the number of directors 
constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.
Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, the Board of 
Directors or any individual director may be removed from office at any time (i) with or without cause by the affirmative 
vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all the then outstanding shares of voting stock of the 
Ccorporation, entitled to vote at an election of directors (the "Voting Stock") or (ii) without cause by the affirmative vote 
of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of the then outstanding shares 
of Voting Stock.
Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, any vacancies on 
the Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation, disqualification, removal or other causes and any newly created 
directorships resulting from any increase in the number of directors, shall, unless the Board of Directors determines by 
resolution that any such vacancies or newly created directorships shall be filled by the stockholders, except as otherwise 
provided by law, be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office, even though less than a 
quorum of the Board of Directors, and not by the stockholders. Any director elected in accordance with the preceding 
sentence shall hold office for the remainder of the full term of the director for which the vacancy was created or 
occurred and until such director’s successor shall have been elected and qualified.
In the event that Section 2115(a) of the California Corporations Code is applicable to 
this corporation, then the following shall apply:
Every stockholder entitled to vote in any election of directors of this 
corporation may cumulate such stockholder’s votes and give one candidate a number of votes equal to the number of 
directors to be elected multiplied by the number of votes to which the stockholder’s shares are otherwise entitled, or 
distribute the stockholder’s votes on the same principle among as many candidates as such stockholder thinks fit;
No stockholder, however, may cumulate such stockholder’s votes for one or 
more candidates unless (i) the names of such candidates have been properly placed in nomination, in accordance with the 
Bylaws of the corporation, prior to the voting, (ii) the stockholder has given advance notice to the corporation of the 
intention to cumulative votes pursuant to the Bylaws, and (iii) the stockholder has given proper notice to the other 
stockholders at the meeting, prior to voting, of such stockholder’s intention to cumulate such stockholder’s votes; and
If any stockholder has given proper notice, all stockholders may cumulate their 
votes for any candidates who have been properly placed in nomination. The candidates receiving the highest number of 
votes of the shares entitled to be voted for them up to the number of directors to be elected by such shares shall be 
declared elected.
Subject to paragraph (h) of Section 43 of the Bylawsthe terms of any Preferred Stock 
Designation that require an additional vote, the Bylaws may be altered or amended or new Bylaws adopted by the 
affirmative vote of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66- 2/3%)a majority of the voting power of all of the thenoutstanding shares of voting stock of the Ccorporation, entitled to vote at an election of directors (the "Voting 
Stock")thereon. The Board of Directors shall also have the power to adopt, amend, or repeal Bylaws.
The directors of the Ccorporation need not be elected by written ballot unless the 
Bylaws so provide.
No action shall be taken by the stockholders of the Ccorporation except at an annual or 
special meeting of stockholders called in accordance with the Bylaws and following the closing of the Initial Public 
Offering no action shall be taken by the stockholders by written consent.
Advance notice of stockholder nominations for the election of directors and of 
business to be brought by stockholders before any meeting of the stockholders of the Ccorporation shall be given in the 
manner provided in the Bylaws of the Ccorporation.
VI.
A director of the Ccorporation shall not be personally liable to the Ccorporation or its 
stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of 
the director's duty of loyalty to the Ccorporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which 
involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation 
Law, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. If the Delaware General 
Corporation Law is amended after approval by the stockholders of this Article to authorize corporate action further 
eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director shall be eliminated or limited to the 
fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as so amended.
Any repeal or modification of this Article VI shall be prospective and shall not affect the rights 
under this Article VI in effect at the time of the alleged occurrence of any act or omission to act giving rise to liability or 
indemnification.
VII.
A-2

The Ccorporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in 
this Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, except as provided in paragraph B 
of this Article VII, and all rights conferred upon the stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law 
which might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any 
particular class or series of the Voting Stock required by law, this Certificate of Incorporation or any Preferred Stock 
Designation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power 
of all of the then-outstanding shares of the Voting Stock, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter, 
amend or repeal Articles V, VI and VII.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which restates and 
integrates and further amends the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the corporation, and which

This deep and broad software stack accelerates the performance and eases the deployment of NVIDIA accelerated 
computing for computationally intensive workloads such as artificial intelligence, or AI, model training and inference, data 
analytics, scientific computing, and 3D graphics, with vertical-specific optimizations to address industries ranging from 
healthcare and telecom to automotive and manufacturing.
Our data-center-scale offerings are comprised of compute and networking solutions that can scale to tens of thousands 
of GPU-accelerated servers interconnected to function as a single giant computer; this type of data center architecture 
and scale is needed for the development and deployment of modern AI applications.
The GPU was initially used to simulate human imagination, enabling the virtual worlds of video games and films. Today, it 
also simulates human intelligence, enabling a deeper understanding of the physical world. Its parallel processing 
capabilities, supported by thousands of computing cores, are essential for deep learning algorithms. This form of AI, in 
which software writes itself by learning from large amounts of data, can serve as the brain of computers, robots, and selfdriving cars that can perceive and understand the world. GPU-powered AI solutions are being developed by thousands of 
enterprises to deliver services and products that would have been immensely difficult or even impossible with traditional 
coding. Examples include generative AI, which can create new content such as text, code, images, audio, video, molecule 
structures, and recommendation systems, which can recommend highly relevant content such as products, services, 
media, or ads using deep neural networks trained on vast datasets that capture the user's preferences.
NVIDIA has a platform strategy, bringing together hardware, systems, software, algorithms, libraries, and services to 
create unique value for the markets we serve. While the computing requirements of these end markets are diverse, we 
address them with a unified underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs and networking and software stacks. The 
programmable nature of our architecture allows us to support several multi-billion-dollar end markets with the same 
underlying technology by using a variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third-party developers and 
partners. The large and growing number of developers and installed base across our platforms strengthens our 
ecosystem and increases the value of our platform to our customers.
Innovation is at our core. We have invested over $58.2 billion in research and development since our inception, yielding 
inventions that are essential to modern computing. Our invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC 
gaming market and redefined computer graphics. With our introduction of the CUDA programming model in 2006, we 
opened the parallel processing capabilities of our GPU to a broad range of compute-intensive applications, paving the way 
for the emergence of modern AI. In 2012, the AlexNet neural network, trained on NVIDIA GPUs, won the ImageNet 
computer image recognition competition, marking the “Big Bang” moment of AI. We introduced our first Tensor Core GPU 
in 2017, built from the ground-up for the new era of AI, and our first autonomous driving system-on-chips, or SoC, in 
2018. Our acquisition of Mellanox in 2020 expanded our innovation canvas to include networking, enabled our platforms 
to be data center scale, and led to the introduction of a new processor class – the data processing unit, or DPU. Over the 
past 5 years, we have built full software stacks that run on top of our GPUs and CUDA to bring AI to the world’s largest 
industries, including NVIDIA DRIVE stack for autonomous driving, Clara for healthcare, and Omniverse for industrial 
digitalization; and introduced the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software – essentially an operating system for enterprise AI 
applications. In 2023, we introduced our first data center CPU, Grace, built for giant-scale AI and high performance 
computing, or HPC. With a strong engineering culture, we drive fast, yet harmonized, product and technology innovations 
in all dimensions of computing including silicon, systems, networking, software and algorithms. More than half of our 
engineers work on software.
The world’s leading cloud service providers, or CSPs, and consumer internet companies use our data center-scale 
accelerated computing platforms to enable, accelerate, develop, or enrich the services and offerings they deliver to 
billions of end users, including AI solutions and assistants, AI foundation models, search, recommendations, social 
networking, online shopping, live video, and translation.
Enterprises and startups across a broad range of industries use our accelerated computing platforms to build new 
generative and agentic AI-enabled products and services, and/or to dramatically accelerate and reduce the costs of their 
workloads and workflows. The enterprise software industry uses them for new AI assistants, chatbots, and agents; the 
transportation industry for autonomous driving; the healthcare industry for accelerated and computer-aided drug 
discovery; and the financial services industry for customer support and fraud detection.

Researchers and developers use our computing solutions to accelerate a wide range of important applications, from 
simulating molecular dynamics to climate forecasting. With support for more than 4,400 applications, NVIDIA computing 
enables some of the most promising areas of discovery, from climate prediction to materials science and from wind 
tunnel simulation to genomics. Including GPUs and networking, NVIDIA powers over 75% of the supercomputers on the 
global TOP500 list, including 38 of the top 50 systems on the Green500 list.
Gamers choose NVIDIA GPUs to enjoy immersive, increasingly cinematic virtual worlds. In addition to serving the growing 
number of gamers, the market for PC GPUs is expanding because of the burgeoning population of live streamers, 
broadcasters, artists, and creators. With the advent of generative AI, we expect a broader set of PC users to choose 
NVIDIA GPUs for running generative AI applications locally on their PC, which is critical for privacy, latency, and costsensitive AI applications.
Professional artists, architects and designers use NVIDIA partner products accelerated with our GPUs and software 
platform for a range of creative and design use cases, such as creating visual effects in movies or designing buildings and 
products. In addition, generative AI is expanding the market for our workstation-class GPUs, as more enterprise 
customers develop and deploy AI applications with their data on-premises. 
Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in 
Delaware in April 1998.

social connectivity and the increasing popularity of game streamers, modders, or gamers who remaster games, and 
creators.
Our gaming platforms leverage our GPUs and sophisticated software to enhance the gaming experience with smoother, 
higher quality graphics. We developed NVIDIA RTX to bring next generation graphics and AI to games. NVIDIA RTX 
features ray tracing technology for real-time, cinematic-quality rendering. Ray tracing, which has long been used for 
special effects in the movie industry, is a computationally intensive technique that simulates the physical behavior of light 
to achieve greater realism in computer-generated scenes. NVIDIA RTX also features deep learning super sampling, or 
NVIDIA DLSS, our AI technology that boosts frame rates while generating beautiful, sharp images for games. RTX GPUs 
will also accelerate a new generation of AI applications. With an installed base of over 100 million AI capable PCs, more 
than 700 RTX AI-enabled applications and games, and a robust suite of development tools, RTX is already the AI PC 
leader.
Our products for the gaming market include GeForce RTX and GeForce GTX GPUs for gaming desktop and laptop PCs, 
GeForce NOW cloud gaming for playing PC games on underpowered devices, as well as SoCs and development services 
for game consoles.
In fiscal year 2025, we launched the NVIDIA Blackwell GeForce RTX 50 Series family of desktop and laptop GPUs. The 
Blackwell architecture introduced neural graphics which combines AI models with traditional rendering to unlock a new 
era of graphics innovation. The RTX 50 Series also features the next generation of our DLSS technology powered for the 
first time by a transformer model architecture. Together these technologies help deliver up to a 2x leap in performance 
and stunning visual realism for PC gamers, developers, and creatives.

We serve the Professional Visualization market by working closely with independent software vendors, or ISVs, to 
optimize their offerings for NVIDIA GPUs. Our GPU computing platform enhances productivity and introduces new 
capabilities for critical workflows in many fields, such as design and manufacturing and digital content creation. Design 
and manufacturing encompass computer-aided design, architectural design, consumer-products manufacturing, medical 
instrumentation, and aerospace. Digital content creation includes professional video editing and post-production, special 
effects for films, and broadcast-television graphics. Additionally, the infusion of generative AI into an increasing number 
of applications is giving rise to the need for the enhanced AI processing capabilities of our RTX GPUs.
The NVIDIA RTX platform makes it possible to render film-quality, photorealistic objects and environments with physically 
accurate shadows, reflections and refractions using ray tracing in real-time. Many leading 3D design and content creation 
applications developed by our ecosystem partners now support RTX, allowing professionals to accelerate and transform 
their workflows with NVIDIA RTX GPUs and software.
We offer NVIDIA Omniverse as a development platform and operating system for building and running virtual world 
simulation applications, available as a software subscription for enterprise use and free for individual use. Industrial

networks using our Data Center computing solutions, and then running a full perception, fusion, planning, and control 
stack within the vehicle on the NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion platform. DRIVE Hyperion consists of the high-performance, 
energy efficient DRIVE AGX computing hardware running an in-vehicle operating system (DRIVE OS), a reference sensor 
set that supports full self-driving capability as well as an open, modular DRIVE software platform for autonomous driving, 
mapping, and parking services, and intelligent in-vehicle experiences.
In addition, we offer a scalable data center-based simulation solution based on NVIDIA Omniverse software to develop 
synthetic data for AI model training, as well as for testing and validating a self-driving platform. Our unique end-to-end, 
software-defined approach is designed for continuous innovation and continuous development, enabling cars to receive 
over-the-air updates to add new features and capabilities throughout the life of a vehicle.
Business Strategies

Advancing the NVIDIA accelerated computing platform. Our accelerated computing platform can solve complex 
problems in significantly less time and with lower power consumption than alternative computational approaches. Indeed, 
it can help solve problems that were previously deemed unsolvable. We work to deliver continued performance leaps that 
outpace Moore’s Law by leveraging innovation across the architecture, chip design, system, interconnect, algorithm, and 
software layers. This full-stack innovation approach allows us to deliver order-of-magnitude performance advantages 
relative to legacy approaches in our target markets, which include Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and 
Automotive. While the computing requirements of these end markets are diverse, we address them with a unified 
underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs, CPUs, CUDA and networking technologies as the fundamental building 
blocks. The programmable nature of our architecture allows us to make leveraged investments in research and 
development: we can support several multi-billion-dollar end markets with shared underlying technology by using a 
variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third-party developers and partners. We utilize this platform 
approach in each of our target markets.
Extending our technology and platform leadership in AI. We provide a complete, end-to-end accelerated computing 
platform for AI, addressing both training and inferencing. This includes full-stack data center-scale compute and 
networking solutions across processing units, interconnects, systems, and software. Our compute solutions include all 
three major processing units in AI servers – GPUs, CPUs, and DPUs. GPUs are uniquely suited to AI, and we will continue to 
add AI-specific features to our GPU architecture to further extend our leadership position.
In addition, we offer DGX Cloud, a fully managed AI-training-as-a-service platform, along with NVIDIA AI Enterprise—a 
comprehensive software suite designed to simplify the development and deployment of production-grade, end-to-end 
generative AI applications. NVIDIA AI Enterprise includes: NVIDIA NIM, which delivers a 2.5x increase in token throughput 
using industry-leading open and proprietary models; NVIDIA NeMo, a complete solution for curating, fine-tuning, 
evaluating, and safeguarding domain-adapted models; and AI Blueprints, pre-built, runnable templates that help 
enterprises build, optimize, and deploy AI agents while preserving privacy. These tools enable organizations to securely 
develop and run AI applications on NVIDIA-accelerated infrastructure anywhere.
Our AI technology leadership is reinforced by our large and expanding ecosystem in a virtuous cycle. Our computing 
platforms are available from virtually every major server maker and CSP, as well as on our own AI supercomputers. There 
are over 5.9 million developers worldwide using CUDA and our other software tools to help deploy our technology in our 
target markets. We evangelize AI through partnerships with hundreds of universities and thousands of startups through 
our Inception program. Additionally, our Deep Learning Institute provides instruction on the latest techniques on how to 
design, train, and deploy neural networks in applications using our accelerated computing platform.
Extending our technology and platform leadership in computer graphics. We believe that computer graphics infused 
with AI is fundamental to the continued expansion and evolution of computing. We apply our research and development 
resources to enhance the user experience for consumer entertainment and professional visualization applications and 
create new virtual world and simulation capabilities. Our technologies are instrumental in driving the gaming, design, and 
creative industries forward, as developers leverage our libraries and algorithms to deliver an optimized experience on our 
GeForce and NVIDIA RTX platforms. Our computer graphics platforms leverage AI end-to-end, from the developer tools 
and cloud services to the Tensor Cores included in all RTX-class GPUs. For example, NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine, or ACE, is 

a suite of technologies that help developers bring digital avatars to life with generative AI, running in the cloud or locally 
on the PC. GeForce Experience enhances each gamer’s experience by optimizing their PC’s settings, as well as enabling 
the recording and sharing of gameplay. Our Studio drivers enhance and accelerate a number of popular creative 
applications. Omniverse is real-time 3D design collaboration and virtual world simulation software that empowers artists, 
designers, and creators to connect and collaborate in leading design applications. We also enable interactive graphics 
applications - such as games, movie and photo editing and design software - to be accessed by almost any device, almost 
anywhere, through our cloud platforms such as vGPU for enterprise and GeForce NOW for gaming. 
Advancing the leading autonomous vehicle platform. We believe the advent of autonomous vehicles, or AV, and electric 
vehicles, or EV, is revolutionizing the transportation industry. The algorithms required for autonomous driving - such as 
perception, localization, and planning - are too complex for legacy hand-coded approaches and will use multiple neural 
networks instead. Therefore, we provide an AI-based hardware and software solution, designed and implemented from 
the ground up based on automotive safety standards, for the AV and EV market under the DRIVE brand, which we are 
bringing to market through our partnerships with automotive OEMs, tier-1 suppliers, and start-ups. Our AV solution also 
includes the GPU-based hardware required to train the neural networks before their in-vehicle deployment, as well as to 
re-simulate their operation prior to any over-the-air software updates. We believe our comprehensive, top-to-bottom and 
end-to-end approach will enable the transportation industry to solve the complex problems arising from the shift to 
autonomous driving.
Leveraging our intellectual property, or IP. We believe our IP is a valuable asset that can be accessed by our customers 
and partners through license and development agreements when they desire to build such capabilities directly into their 
own products or have us do so through a custom development. Such license and development arrangements can further 
enhance the reach of our technology.
Sales and Marketing
Our worldwide sales and marketing strategy is key to achieving our objective of providing markets with our highperformance and efficient computing platforms and software. Our sales and marketing teams, located across our global 
markets, work closely with customers and various industry ecosystems through our partner network. Our partner 
network incorporates global, regional and specialized CSPs, OEMs, ODMs, ISVs, global system integrators, add-in board 
manufacturers, or AIBs, distributors, automotive manufacturers and tier-1 automotive suppliers, and other ecosystem 
participants.
Members of our sales team have technical expertise and product and industry knowledge. We also employ a team of 
application engineers and solution architects to provide pre-sales assistance to our partner network in designing, testing, 
and qualifying system designs that incorporate our platforms. For example, our solution architects work with CSPs to 
provide pre-sales assistance to enable our customers to optimize their hardware and software infrastructure for 
generative AI and LLM training and deployment. They also work with foundation model and enterprise software 
developers to enable our customers to optimize the training and fine-tuning of their models and services, and with 
enterprise end-users, often in collaboration with their global system integrator of choice, to fine-tune models and build AI 
applications. We believe that the depth and quality of our design support are key to improving our partner network’s 
time-to-market, maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction, and fostering relationships that encourage our 
customers and partner network to use the next generation of our products within each platform.
To encourage the development of applications optimized for our platforms and software, we seek to establish and 
maintain strong relationships in the software development community. Engineering and marketing personnel engage 
with key software developers to promote and discuss our platforms, as well as to ascertain individual product 
requirements and solve technical problems. Our developer program supports the development of AI frameworks, SDKs, 
and APIs for software applications and game titles that are optimized for our platforms. Our Deep Learning Institute 
provides in-person and online training for developers in industries and organizations around the world to build AI and 
accelerated computing applications that leverage our platforms.
Seasonality
Our computing platforms serve a diverse set of markets such as data centers, gaming, professional visualization, and 
automotive. Our desktop gaming products typically see stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year. Historical 
seasonality trends may not repeat.
Manufacturing 
We utilize a fabless and contracting manufacturing strategy, whereby we employ and partner with key suppliers for all 
phases of the manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging. We use the expertise 
of industry-leading suppliers that are certified by the International Organization for Standardization in such areas as 
fabrication, assembly, quality control and assurance, reliability, and testing. Additionally, we can avoid many of the 
significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations. While we may directly 
procure certain raw materials used in the production of our products, such as memory, substrates, and a variety of 
components, our suppliers are responsible for procurement of most raw materials used in the production of our products. 
As a result, we can focus our resources on product design, quality assurance, marketing, and customer support. In periods 

of growth, we may place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in advance of our historical 
lead times, pay premiums, or provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity and may need to continue to do so.
We have expanded our supplier relationships to build redundancy and resilience in our operations to provide long-term 
manufacturing capacity aligned with growing customer demand. Our supply chain is mainly concentrated in the AsiaPacific region. We utilize foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, or TSMC, and 
Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., or Samsung, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We purchase memory from SK Hynix 
Inc., Micron Technology, Inc., and Samsung. We utilize CoWoS technology for semiconductor packaging. We engage with 
independent subcontractors and contract manufacturers such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., Wistron 
Corporation, and Fabrinet to perform assembly, testing and packaging of our final products.
Competition 
The market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving 
industry standards. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product 
offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution channels, software support, conformity to industry 
standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing, and total system costs. We believe that our ability to remain 
competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers and partners will 
demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at 
competitive prices. We expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with 
products that may be lower priced than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by 
our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire 
significant market share.
A significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, CPUs, DPUs, 
embedded SoCs, and other accelerated, AI computing processor products, and providers of semiconductor-based highperformance interconnect products based on InfiniBand, Ethernet, Fibre Channel, and proprietary technologies. Some of 
our competitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be 
more able to adapt to customers or technological changes. We expect an increasingly competitive environment in the 
future.
Our current competitors include:
suppliers and licensors of hardware and software for discrete and integrated GPUs, custom chips and other 
accelerated computing solutions, including solutions offered for AI, such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., or 
AMD, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., or Huawei, and Intel Corporation, or Intel;
large cloud services companies with internal teams designing hardware and software that incorporate 
accelerated or AI computing functionality as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as Alibaba Group, 
Alphabet Inc., Amazon, Inc., or Amazon, Baidu, Inc., Huawei, and Microsoft Corporation, or Microsoft;

designing SoC products for their own products and services, such as Tesla, Inc.; and
networking products consisting of switches, network adapters (including DPUs), and cable solutions (including 
optical modules) include such as AMD, Arista Networks, Broadcom, Cisco Systems, Inc., Hewlett Packard 
Enterprise Company, Huawei, Intel, Lumentum Holdings Inc., and Marvell Technology, Inc. as well as internal 
teams of system vendors and large cloud services companies.
Patents and Proprietary Rights
We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure 
agreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our IP in the United States and internationally. Our currently issued 
patents have expiration dates from February 2025 to June 2045. We have numerous patents issued, allowed, and pending 
in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our 
products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on international treaties, organizations, 
and foreign laws to protect our IP. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be 
manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or IP rights to the same extent as 
the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products 
more likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for innovations and technologies based 
on such factors as:
the location in which our products are manufactured;

our strategic technology or product directions in different countries;
the degree to which IP laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and
the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors' operations in particular countries and 
regions.
We have licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue entering such license agreements.
Government Regulations
Our worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well as of 
foreign governments.
Over the past three years, we have been subject to a series of shifting and expanding export control restrictions, 
impacting our ability to serve customers outside the United States.
In August 2022, the U.S. government, or the USG, announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions, impact 
exports to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other 
systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.
In July 2023, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products 
destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.
In October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth 
quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to Saudi 
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain performance 
thresholds, including, but not limited to, the A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing 
requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, 
or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed 
us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S 
products (removing the grace period granted by the official rule). Blackwell systems, such as GB200 NVL 72 and NVL 36 
as well as B200 are also subject to these requirements and therefore require a license for any shipment to certain entities 
and to China and Country Groups D1, D4 and D5, excluding Israel. To date, we have not received licenses to ship these 
restricted products to China. Additionally, we understand that partners and customers have also not received a license to 
ship these restricted products.
On January 15, 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” IFR in the Federal Register. After a 120-day delayed compliance 
period, the IFR will, unless modified, impose a worldwide licensing requirement on all products classified under Export 
Control Classification Numbers, or ECCNs, 3A090.a, 4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, including all related software 
and technology. Any system that incorporates one or more of the covered integrated circuits, or ICs, (including but not 
limited to NVIDIA DGX, HGX, and MGX systems) will be covered by the new licensing requirement. The licensing 
requirement will include future NVIDIA ICs, boards, or systems classified with ECCN 3A090.a or 4A090.a, or 
corresponding .z ECCNs, achieving certain total processing performance and/or performance density.
Unless a license exception is available, the worldwide licensing requirements will apply to the following NVIDIA products, 
and any others we develop that meet the characteristics of 3A090.a or 4A090.a, including but not limited to: A100, A800, 
H100, H200, H800, B100, B200, GB200, L4, L40S, and RTX 6000 Ada.
Our competitive position has been harmed by the existing export controls, and our competitive position and future 
results may be further harmed, over the long term, if there are further changes in the USG’s export controls. Given the 
increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the 
export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing 
requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to 
sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing 
requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, including 
the Middle East and countries designated “Tier 2” by the AI Diffusion IFR. In addition to export controls, the USG may 
impose restrictions on the import and sale of products that incorporate technologies developed or manufactured in 
whole or in part in China. For example, the USG is considering restrictions on the import and sale of certain automotive 
products in the United States, which if adopted and interpreted broadly, could impact our ability to develop and supply 
solutions for our automotive customers.
While we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the AsiaPacific region, new and existing export controls or changes to existing export controls could limit alternative 
manufacturing locations and negatively impact our business. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to 
Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters” for a discussion of this potential impact.

Compliance with laws, rules, and regulations has not otherwise had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, 
results of operations, or competitive position and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for 
environmental control facilities. Compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited 
to, those pertaining to IP ownership and infringement, taxes, import and export requirements and tariffs, anti-corruption, 
business acquisitions, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, 
competition and antitrust, advertising, employment, product regulations, cybersecurity, environmental, health and safety 
requirements, the responsible use of AI, climate change, cryptocurrency, and consumer laws, could further increase our 
costs, impact our competitive position, and otherwise may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial 
condition and results of operations in subsequent periods. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of these 
potential impacts.
Sustainability and Governance
NVIDIA invents computing technologies that improve lives and address global challenges. Our goal is to integrate sound 
environmental, social, and corporate governance principles and practices into every aspect of the Company. The 
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for reviewing and discussing 
with management our practices related to sustainability and corporate governance. We assess our programs annually in 
consideration of stakeholder expectations, market trends, and business risks and opportunities. These issues are 
important for our continued business success and reflect the topics of highest concern to NVIDIA and our stakeholders. 
The following section and the Human Capital Management Section below provide an overview of our principles and 
practices. More information can be found on our website and in our annual Sustainability Report. Information contained 
on our website or in our annual Sustainability Report is not incorporated by reference into this or any other report we file 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of risks and 
uncertainties we face related to sustainability.
Climate Change
In the area of environmental sustainability, we work to address our climate impacts across our product lifecycle and 
assess related risks, including current and emerging regulations and market impacts.
In May 2024, we published metrics related to our environmental impact for fiscal year 2024. Fiscal year 2025 metrics are 
expected to be published in the first half of fiscal year 2026. There has been no material impact to our capital 
expenditures, results of operations or competitive position associated with global environmental sustainability 
regulations, compliance, or costs from sourcing renewable energy. We committed to purchase or generate enough 
renewable energy to match 100% of our global electricity usage for offices and data centers under our operational 
control starting with our fiscal year 2025. In fiscal year 2024, we made progress towards this goal and increased the 
percentage of our electricity use matched by renewable energy to 76%. By the end of fiscal year 2026, we also aim to 
engage manufacturing suppliers comprising at least 67% of NVIDIA’s scope 3 category 1 GHG emissions with the goal of 
effecting supplier adoption of science-based targets.
Whether it is creation of technology to power next-generation laptops or designs to support high-performance 
supercomputers, improving energy efficiency is important in our research, development, and design processes. GPUaccelerated computing is inherently more energy efficient than traditional computing for many workloads because it is 
optimized for throughput, performance per watt, and certain AI workloads. We continue to have a strong presence on the 
Green500 list of the most energy-efficient systems—we powered 8 of the top 10 most energy efficient systems, 
including the top supercomputer, on the November 2024 Green500 list.
We launched our Earth-2 initiative to create a digital twin of the Earth on NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse platforms. 
Earth-2 will enable scientists, companies, and policy makers to do ultra-high-resolution predictions of the impact of 
climate change and explore mitigation and adaptation strategies.
Human Capital Management
We believe that our employees are our greatest assets, and they play a key role in creating long-term value for our 
stakeholders. As of the end of fiscal year 2025, we had approximately 36,000 employees in 38 countries; 27,100 were 
engaged in research and development and 8,900 were engaged in sales, marketing, operations, and administrative 
positions. The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors assists in the oversight of policies and strategies 
relating to human capital management.
To execute our business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and retain the very best talent globally, including 
exceptional executives, scientists, engineers, and technical and non-technical staff.
Recruitment
As the demand for global technical talent continues to be high, we have grown our technical workforce and have been 
successful in attracting top talent to NVIDIA. We have attracted talent worldwide through our strong employer brand and 
differentiated hiring strategies for college, professional, and leadership talent. Our workforce is 82% technical and 51% 

hold advanced degrees. Additionally, we have increased our focus on diversity recruiting and we welcome employees of all 
backgrounds. Our own employees also help to surface top talent, with over 41% of our new hires in fiscal year 2025 
coming from employee referrals.
Development and Retention
To support employee development, we provide opportunities to learn on-the-job through training courses, targeted 
development programs, mentoring and peer coaching and ongoing feedback. We constantly upgrade our learning 
offerings to ensure that our employees are exposed to the most current content and technologies available. We offer 
tuition reimbursement programs to subsidize educational programs and advanced certifications and encourage internal 
job mobility. We have also implemented specifically designed mentoring and development programs for women and 
employees from traditionally underrepresented groups to ensure widespread readiness for future advancement.
To evaluate employee sentiment and engagement, we use pulse surveys, a suggestion box, and an anonymous third-party 
platform. We want NVIDIA to be a place where people can grow their careers over their lifetime and our employees tend 
to come and stay. In fiscal year 2025, our overall turnover rate was 2.5%.
Compensation, Benefits, and Well-Being
Our compensation program rewards performance and is structured to encourage employees to invest in the Company’s 
future. Employees receive equity, except where unavailable due to local regulations, that is tied to the value of our stock 
price and vests over time to retain employees while simultaneously aligning their interests with those of our shareholders.
We offer comprehensive benefits to support our employees’ and their families’ physical health, well-being, and financial 
health. Programs include 401(k) programs in the U.S., statutory and supplemental pension programs outside the U.S., our 
employee stock purchase program, flexible work hours, and time off policies. We evaluate our benefit offerings globally 
and aim to provide comparable support across the regions where we operate. We offer tailored benefits based on the 
needs of our employees including continuing support for parents; both new birth parents and those who wish to become 
parents. Our support is enhanced during times of crisis, such as war or economic volatility, to take care of our existing 
team of world-class talent and their families.
Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at NVIDIA
We believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to creating an inclusive culture that supports all our 
employees.
When recruiting new talent or developing our current employees, we strive to build a diverse talent pipeline that includes 
those underrepresented in the technology field, including women, Black/African American, and Hispanic/Latino 
candidates.
To this end, we:
Hire, promote and compensate our employees based on merit;
Partner with institutions and professional organizations serving historically underrepresented communities;
Enlist dedicated recruiting teams to shepherd underrepresented candidates through the interview process and 
identify internal opportunities;
Support the development and growth of women employees through programs aimed at building a pipeline of 
future leaders;
Provide peer support and executive sponsors for our internal community resource groups;
Provide training and education to managers and peers on fostering supportive environments that allow all our 
employees to do their best work;
Track equity and parity in retention, promotions, pay, and employee engagement scores; and
Measure year over year progress and provide leadership visibility on talent and diversity efforts.
As of the end of fiscal year 2025, our global workforce was 78% male, 21% female, and 1% not declared, with 6% of our 
workforce in the United States composed of Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino employees.
Flexible Working Environment
We support a flexible work environment allowing us to recruit the very best employees, regardless of where they live. This 
flexibility supports diverse hiring, retention of talent, including working parents and other caregivers and employee 
engagement, which we believe makes NVIDIA a great place to work. We also provide company-wide 2-days off per quarter 
for employees to rest and recharge.

Risk Factors
Risks Related to Our Industry and Markets
Failure to meet the evolving needs of our industry and markets may adversely impact our financial results.
Our accelerated computing platforms experience rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, competitive 
products, and industry standards. 
Our success depends on our ability to: 
timely identify industry changes, adapt our strategies, and develop new or enhance and maintain existing 
products and technologies that meet the evolving needs of our markets, including addressing unexpected shifts 
in industry standards or disruptive technological innovations that could render our products incompatible with 
those developed by other companies; 
develop or acquire new products and technologies through investments in research and development; 
launch new offerings with new business models including software, services, and cloud solutions, as well as 
software-, infrastructure-, or platform-as-a-service solutions; 
expand the ecosystem for our products and technologies; 
meet evolving and prevailing customer and industry safety, security, reliability expectations, and compliance 
standards; 
manage product and software lifecycles to maintain customer and end-user satisfaction; 
develop, acquire, maintain, and secure access to the internal and external infrastructure needed to scale our 
business, including sufficient energy for powering data centers using our products, acquisition integrations, 
customer support, e-commerce, IP licensing capabilities, and cloud service capacity; and 
complete technical, financial, operational, compliance, sales and marketing investments for the above activities. 
We have invested in research and development in markets where we have a limited operating history, which may not 
produce meaningful revenue for several years, if at all. If we fail to develop or monetize new products and technologies, or 
if they do not become widely adopted, our financial results could be adversely affected. Obtaining design wins may 
involve a lengthy process and depends on our ability to anticipate and provide features and functionality that customers 
will demand. They also do not guarantee revenue. Failure to obtain a design win may prevent us from obtaining future 
design wins in subsequent generations. We cannot ensure that our products and technologies will provide value to our 
customers and partners. If we fail any of these key success criteria, our financial results may be harmed. 
We offer enterprise customers NVIDIA DGX Cloud services, which include cloud-based infrastructure, software and 
services for training and deploying AI models. We have partnered with CSPs to host such software and services in their 
data centers, and we entered and may continue to enter into multi-year cloud service agreements to support these 
offerings and our research and development activities. The timing and availability of these cloud services have changed 
and may continue to shift, impacting our revenue, expenses, and development timelines. NVIDIA DGX Cloud services may 
not be successful and will take time, resources, and investment. We also offer or plan to offer standalone software 
solutions, including NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA Omniverse, NVIDIA DRIVE, and other software products. These new 
business models or strategies may not be successful, and we may fail to sell any meaningful standalone software or 
services. We may incur significant costs and may not achieve any significant revenue from these offerings. 
Competition could adversely impact our market share and financial results.
Our target markets remain competitive, and competition may intensify with expanding and changing product and service 
offerings, industry standards, customer and market needs, new entrants and consolidations. Our competitors’ products, 
services and technologies, including those mentioned above in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may be cheaper or 
provide better functionality or features than ours, which has resulted and may in the future result in lower-than-expected 
selling prices or demand for our products. Some of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities, and have 
longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive IP portfolios and patent protections, more design 

wins, and greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. These competitors may be able to 
acquire market share and/or prevent us from doing so, more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new 
markets and end-user trends, more quickly transition their products, and impinge on our ability to procure sufficient 
foundry capacity and scarce input materials during a supply-constrained environment, which could harm our business. 
Some of our customers have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities similar to some of ours and can use 
or develop their own solutions to replace those we are providing. For example, others may offer cloud-based services that 
compete with our AI cloud service offerings, and we may not be able to establish market share sufficient to achieve the 
scale necessary to meet our business objectives. If we are unable to successfully compete in this environment, demand 
for our products, services and technologies could decrease and we may not establish meaningful revenue.
Risks Related to Demand, Supply, and Manufacturing
Long manufacturing lead times and uncertain supply and component availability, combined with a failure to estimate 
customer demand accurately, has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.
We have long manufacturing lead times and build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated 
demand. In periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply 
chain, the lead times for certain supply may be extended. We have previously experienced and may continue to 
experience extended lead times of more than 12 months. To secure future supply and capacity, we have paid premiums, 
provided deposits, and entered into long-term supply agreements and capacity commitments, which have increased our 
product costs and this may continue. We may still be unable to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address 
our business needs. 
If we inaccurately estimate demand, or our customers change orders, as we have experienced in the past, we may not be 
able to reduce our supply commitments in time, at the same rate, or at all. Significant mismatches between supply and 
demand have varied across our market platforms, resulted in both product shortages and excess inventory, significantly 
harmed our financial results and could reoccur. If we underestimate demand, and our foundry partners and contract 
manufacturers are unable to increase production or provide sufficient supply, we may not be able to meet increased 
customer demand in a timely manner, or at all. Our reputation and customer relationships could be damaged and we 
could lose revenue and market share. Additionally, since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, 
supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any one component have had and may have a broader revenue 
impact. For example, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary for the 
finished products are not available from third parties.
If we overestimate demand, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we may 
not be able to utilize on-hand inventory or reduce purchase commitments accordingly. We have had to reduce average 
selling prices, including due to our channel pricing programs, increase prices for certain of our products as a result of our 
suppliers’ increase in prices, write down our inventory, incur cancellation penalties, and record impairments, and may have 
to do so in the future. These impacts would be amplified by our non-cancellable and non-returnable purchase orders 
placed in advance of our historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of 
future products. The risk of these impacts has increased and may continue to increase as our purchase obligations and 
prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total supply. All of these 
factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.
Factors that have caused and/or could in the future cause us to underestimate or overestimate demand, and impact the 
timing and volume of our revenue, include:
changes in product development cycles and time to market;
competing technologies and competitor product releases, announcements or other actions;
changes in business and economic conditions;
sudden or sustained government lockdowns or public health issues;
rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;
the availability of sufficient data center capacity or energy for customers to procure;
new product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products;
new or unexpected end-use cases;
increase in demand for competitive products;
changes in end-user demand; 

purchasing decisions made, and inventory levels held by, distributors, ODMs, OEMs, system integrators, other 
channel partners and other third parties;
the ability of developers, end customers and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain accelerated 
computing applications that leverage our platforms; 
the availability of third-party content on our platforms, such as GeForce NOW; 
the demand for accelerated computing, AI-related cloud services, or large language models;
changes that impact the ecosystem for the architectures underlying our products and technologies; 
government actions or changes in governmental policies, such as export controls, increased restrictions on 
gaming usage, or tariffs; and
our customers' ability to invest in AI infrastructure.
Challenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional 
basis. Extended lead times may occur if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics or 
other events. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan and China, which comprise a significant 
portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers, contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to 
our supply continuity, could have a material adverse impact on us.
We continue to increase our supply and capacity purchases with existing and new suppliers to support our demand 
projections and increasing complexity of our data center products. With these additions, we have also entered and may 
continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both current and future products. The 
increased purchase volumes and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our supply chain creates 
more complexity in managing multiple suppliers with variations in production planning, execution and logistics. Our 
expanding product portfolio and varying component compatibility and quality may lead to increased inventory levels. We 
have incurred and may in the future incur inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity 
commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.
Product transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously as our 
channel partners prepare to ship and support new products. We are generally in various stages of transitioning the 
architectures of our Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive products. The computing industry is 
experiencing a broader and faster launch cadence of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing and diverse set 
of AI opportunities. We have introduced a new product and architecture cadence of our Data Center solutions where we 
seek to complete new computing solutions each year and provide a greater variety of Data Center offerings. The 
increased frequency of these transitions and the larger number of products and product configurations may magnify the 
challenges associated with managing our supply and demand which may further create volatility in our revenue. 
Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions, and channel partners reducing channel 
inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can reduce, or create volatility in, our revenue. We 
have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for current generation architectures when 
customers anticipate transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for 
current and future architecture transitions. Our financial results have been and may in the future be negatively impacted 
if we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason. The increased frequency and 
complexity of newly introduced products could result in unanticipated quality or production issues that could increase the 
magnitude of inventory provisions, warranty, or other costs or result in product delays. For example, our gross margins in 
the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 were negatively impacted by inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwell 
material. 
We incur significant engineering development resources for new products, and changes to our product roadmap may 
impact our ability to develop other products or adequately manage our supply chain cost. Customers may delay 
purchasing existing products as we increase the frequency of new products or may not be able to adopt our new 
products as fast as forecasted, both impacting the timing of our revenue and supply chain cost. While we have managed 
prior product transitions and have sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, 
may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and may cause us to incur additional costs.
Demand estimates for our products, applications, and services can be incorrect, which may create volatility in our revenue 
or supply levels. We may not be able to generate significant revenue from them. Because our products may be used in 
multiple use cases and applications, it is difficult to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the impact of 
generative AI models on our reported revenue or forecasted demand.
The use of our GPUs for new, mercurial, or trendy applications, has impacted and can impact in the future demand for our 
products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, several years ago, our Gaming 
GPUs began to be used for mining digital currencies, such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any 
reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of 

cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute 
technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency 
standards and changes in the method of verifying blockchain transactions, has impacted and can in the future impact 
cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further impact our ability to estimate demand for our 
products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the Ethereum 2.0 merge in 
2022, have reduced and may in the future decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining. This has created and may in 
the future create increased aftermarket sales of our GPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and 
reduce demand for our new GPUs. In general, our new products or previously sold products may be resold online or on the 
unauthorized “gray market,” which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products and reseller 
marketplaces compete with our new products and distribution channels. Our inability to accurately predict our demand 
that arises from new use cases may create volatility in our revenue. 
Dependency on third-party suppliers and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, or package our products 
reduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, and product delivery schedules and could 
harm our business.
We depend on foundries to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. 
We do not assemble, test, or package our products, but instead contract with independent subcontractors. These 
subcontractors assist with procuring components used in our systems, boards, and products. We face risks which have 
adversely affected or could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand and scale our supply chain, negatively 
impact longer-term demand for our products and services, and adversely affect our business operations, gross margin, 
revenue and/or financial results, including:
lack of guaranteed supply of wafer, component and capacity;
decommitment by our suppliers;
potential higher wafer and component prices resulting from incorrectly estimating demand and failing to place 
orders with our suppliers with sufficient quantities or timely;
failure by our foundries or contract manufacturers to procure raw materials or provide adequate levels of 
manufacturing or test capacity for our products;
failure by our foundries to develop, obtain, or successfully implement high quality process technologies, including 
transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and memory 
designs needed to manufacture our products;
failure by our suppliers to comply with our policies and expectations and emerging regulatory requirements;
limited number and geographic concentration of global suppliers, foundries, contract manufacturers, assembly 
and test providers and memory manufacturers;
loss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or 
subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss, addition or change of a 
supplier;
lack of direct control over product quantity, quality, and delivery schedules;
integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers creating more complexity in managing multiple 
suppliers with variations in production planning, execution, and logistics;
suppliers or their suppliers failing to provide high quality products and/or making changes to their products 
without our qualification;
delays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our 
subcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors’ or other customers’ orders over ours;
requirements to place orders that are not cancellable upon changes in demand or requirements to prepay for 
supply in advance;
low manufacturing yields resulting from issues in our product design or a foundry’s proprietary process 
technology; 
suppliers extending lead times and/or increasing costs during shortages; and
disruptions in manufacturing, assembly and other processes due to closures related to heat waves, earthquakes, 
fires, or other natural disasters, electricity conservation efforts, pandemics, and cybersecurity incidents.

Defects in our products have caused and could cause us to incur significant expenses to remediate, which can damage 
our reputation and cause us to lose market share.
Our hardware and software product and service offerings are complex. They have in the past and may in the future 
contain defects, security vulnerabilities, experience failures, or unsatisfactory performance due to issues in design, 
fabrication, packaging, materials, bugs and/or use within a system. These risks may also increase when our products are 
introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications, or new versions are released, and when we rely on 
partners to supply and manufacture components that are used in our products, as these arrangements reduce our direct 
control over production. AI software products that we or our partners offer rely on training data that may originate from 
third parties and new training methods, and the resulting products may contain unknown or undetected defects and 
errors, or reflect unintended bias. Although arrangements with component providers may contain provisions for product 
defect expense reimbursement, we generally remain responsible to the customer for warranty product defects that may 
occur from time to time. Some failures in our products or services have been in the past and may in the future be only 
discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used. 
Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could result in loss of data or intangible property, or expose our 
customers to unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malicious software programs that could attack our 
products or services. Defects or failure of our offerings to perform to specifications could lead to substantial damage to 
the products in which our offerings have been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIB manufacturers, automotive 
manufacturers, and tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such defect may cause us to 
incur significant warranty, support, and repair or replacement costs as part of a product recall or otherwise, write-off the 
value of related inventory, and divert the attention of our engineering and management personnel from our product 
development efforts to find and correct the issue. Our efforts to remedy these issues may not be timely or satisfactory 
to our customers. An error or defect in new products, releases or related software drivers after commencement of 
commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance, loss of design wins, temporary or permanent 
withdrawal from a product or market and harm to our relationships with existing and prospective customers and partners 
and consumers’ perceptions of our brand, which would in turn negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, 
revenue and/or financial results. We may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including for 
costs to repair or replace products in the field or in connection with indemnification obligations, or pay fines imposed by 
regulatory agencies.
For example, in fiscal year 2023, a defect was identified in a third-party component embedded in certain Data Center 
products. This defect has had, and other defects may in the future have, an adverse effect on our cost and supply of 
components and finished goods. These costs could be significant in future periods. We recorded a net warranty liability 
during fiscal year 2023 primarily in connection with this defect. While we believe we have accurately recorded for 
warranty obligations, we may need to record additional amounts in the future if our estimate proves to be incorrect. In 
general, if a product liability claim regarding any of our products is brought against us, even if the alleged damage is due 
to the actions or inactions of a third party, such as within our supply chain, the cost of defending the claim could be 
significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business. Further, our 
business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could 
adversely impact our financial results.
Risks Related to Our Global Operating Business
Adverse economic conditions may harm our business.
Economic and industry uncertainty or changes, including recession or slowing growth, inflation, changes or uncertainty in 
fiscal, monetary, or trade policy, disruptions to capital markets and the banking system, currency fluctuations, higher 
interest rates, tighter credit, lower capital expenditures by businesses, including on IT infrastructure, increases in 
unemployment, labor shortages, and lower consumer confidence and spending, global supply chain constraints, and 
global economic and geopolitical developments, including the implementation of tariffs by the USG or other governments, 
have in the past and/or could in the future have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial results, 
including:
increased costs for wafers, components, logistics, and other supply chain expenses, which have negatively 
impacted our gross margin in the past and may do so in the future;
increased supply, employee, facilities and infrastructure costs and volatility in the financial markets, which have 
reduced and may in the future reduce our margins;
decrease in demand for our products, services and technologies and those of our customers, partners or 
licensees;
the inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us and our customers’ or our licensees’ 
inability to supply products to customers and/or end users;
limits on our ability to forecast operating results and make business decisions;

the insolvency of key suppliers, distributors, customers, CSPs, data center providers, licensing parties or other 
third parties we rely on;
reduced profitability of customers, which may cause them to scale back operations, exit businesses, file for 
bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, or lead to mergers, consolidations or strategic alliances 
among other companies, which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively; and
increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets, reduced 
liquidity, adverse impacts on our customers and suppliers, failures of counterparties, including financial 
institutions and insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the value of our financial instruments. 
Adverse developments affecting financial institutions, such as bank failures or instability, or concerns or speculation 
about similar events or risks, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems and other disruptions, which could impact our 
customers’ ability to fulfill their payment obligations to us, our vendors’ ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us, 
or our ability to fulfill our own obligations.
Additionally, we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are 
subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or 
events that affect global financial markets, as described above. A majority of our investment portfolio comprises USG 
securities. A decline in global financial markets for long periods or a downgrade of the USG credit rating due to an actual 
or threatened default on government debt could result in higher interest rates, a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar, 
reduced market liquidity or other adverse conditions. These factors could cause an unrealized or realized loss position in 
our investments or require us to record impairment charges.
International sales and operations are a significant part of our business, which exposes us to risks that could harm our 
business.
We sell our products internationally, and we also have operations and conduct business internationally. Our 
semiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United 
States, and we generated 53% of our revenue in fiscal year 2025 from sales outside the United States. The market in 
China, where our offerings are limited by export controls, is highly competitive and we expect it to remain competitive 
going forward. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which have had in the 
past and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
These include domestic and international economic and political conditions in countries in which we and our suppliers and 
manufacturers do business, government lockdowns to control case spread of global or local health issues, differing legal 
standards with respect to protection of IP and employment practices, different domestic and international business and 
cultural practices, disruptions to capital markets, counter-inflation policies, currency fluctuations, natural disasters, acts 
of war or other military actions, terrorism, public health issues, restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs, 
sanctions, and other controls on imports or exports, and catastrophic events.
Product, system security, and data protection incidents or breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our 
operations, reduce our expected revenue, increase our expenses, and significantly harm our business and reputation.
Security breaches, computer malware, social-engineering attacks, denial-of-service attacks, software bugs, server 
malfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, and other cyber-attacks 
are becoming increasingly sophisticated, making it more difficult to successfully detect, defend against them or 
implement adequate preventative measures.
Cyber-attacks, including ransomware attacks by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-statesupported actors, may become more prevalent and severe. Our ability to recover from ransomware attacks may be limited 
if our backups have been affected by the attack, or if restore from backups is delayed or not feasible.
Individuals, groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including nation-states and nation-state-supported 
actors, and other threat actors have engaged and are expected to continue to engage in cyber-attacks. Additionally, some 
actors are using AI technology to launch more automated, targeted and coordinated attacks. Due to geopolitical conflicts 
and during times of war or other major conflicts, we and the third parties we rely upon may be subject to a heightened 
risk of cyber-attacks that could materially disrupt our ability to provide services and products. We may also face 
cybersecurity threats due to error or intentional misconduct by employees, contractors or other third-party service 
providers. Certain aspects of effective cybersecurity are dependent upon our employees, contractors and/or other thirdparty service providers safeguarding our sensitive information and adhering to our security policies and access control 
mechanisms. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, security incidents arising from a failure 
to properly handle sensitive information or adhere to our security policies and access control mechanisms, including, for 
example, employees posting company data on third-party websites without permission, and, although no such events 
have had a material adverse effect on our business, there can be no assurance that an insider threat or error will not 
result in an incident that is material to us or lead to negative publicity. Furthermore, we rely on products and services 
provided by third-party suppliers to operate certain critical business systems, including without limitation, cloud-based 
infrastructure, encryption and authentication technology, employee email and other functions, which exposes us to 

supply-chain attacks or other business disruptions. We cannot guarantee that third parties and infrastructure in our 
supply chain or our partners’ supply chains have not been compromised or that they do not contain exploitable 
vulnerabilities, defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our information technology systems, 
including our products and services, or the third-party information technology systems that support our services. We 
have incorporated third-party data into some of our AI models and used open-source datasets to train our models and 
may continue to do so. These datasets may be flawed, insufficient, or contain certain biased information, and may 
otherwise decrease resilience to security incidents that may compromise the integrity of our AI outputs, leading to 
potential reputational damage, regulatory scrutiny, or adverse impacts on the performance and reliability of our products, 
which could, in turn, affect our partners' operations, customer trust, and our revenue. We may have limited insight into 
the data privacy or security practices of third-party suppliers, including for our AI algorithms. Our ability to monitor these 
third parties’ information security practices is limited, and they may not have adequate information security measures in 
place. In addition, if one of our third-party suppliers suffers a security incident (which has happened in the past and may 
happen in the future), our response may be limited or more difficult because we may not have direct access to their 
systems, logs and other information related to the security incident. Additionally, we are incorporated into the supply 
chain of a large number of entities worldwide and, as a result, if our products or services are compromised, a significant 
number of our customers and their data could be affected, which could result in potential liability and harm our business.
To defend against security incidents, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and 
reliability features, which is expected to result in increased expenses. We must also continue to develop our security 
measures, including training programs and security awareness initiatives, designed to ensure our suppliers have 
appropriate security measures in place, and continue to meet the evolving security requirements of our customers, 
applicable industry standards, and government regulations. While we invest in training programs and security awareness 
initiatives and take steps to detect and remediate certain vulnerabilities that we have identified, we may not always be 
able to prevent threats or detect and mitigate all vulnerabilities in our security controls, systems or software, including 
third-party software we have installed, as such threats and techniques change frequently and may not be detected until 
after a security incident has occurred. Further, we may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures 
designed to address identified vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could result in reputational and financial harm, and if 
exploited, these vulnerabilities could result in a security incident.
We hold confidential, sensitive, personal and proprietary information, including information from partners and customers. 
Breaches of our security measures, along with reported or perceived vulnerabilities or unapproved dissemination of 
proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or third parties, could expose us and the parties 
affected to a risk of loss, or misuse of this information, potentially resulting in litigation and subsequent liability, 
regulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm, including financial, to our business. For 
example, we hold proprietary game source code from third-party partners in our GFN service. Breaches of our GFN 
security measures, which have happened in the past, could expose our partners to the risk of loss or misuse of this source 
code, damage both us and our partners, and expose NVIDIA to potential litigation and liability. If we or a third party we rely 
on experience a security incident, which has occurred in the past, or are perceived to have experienced a security incident, 
we may experience adverse consequences, including government enforcement actions, additional reporting requirements 
and/or oversight, restrictions on processing data, litigation, indemnification obligations, reputational harm, diversion of 
funds, diversion of management attention, financial loss, loss of data, material disruptions in our systems and operations, 
supply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute our goods and services, and other similar harms. Inability to fulfill 
orders, delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial 
results, stock price and reputation. We are required by certain data privacy and security obligations to notify relevant 
stakeholders, including affected individuals, customers, regulators and investors, of security incidents, and mandatory 
disclosure of such incidents could lead to negative publicity. In addition to experiencing a security incident, third parties 
may gather, collect or infer sensitive information about us from public sources, data brokers or other means that reveals 
competitively sensitive details about our organization and could be used to harm our business.
Business disruptions could harm our operations, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs.
Factors that have caused and/or could in the future cause disruptions to our worldwide operations include: natural 
disasters, extreme weather conditions, power or water shortages, critical infrastructure failures, telecommunications 
failures, supplier disruptions, terrorist attacks, acts of violence, political and/or civil unrest, acts of war or other military 
actions, epidemics or pandemics, abrupt regulatory changes, and other natural or man-made disasters and catastrophic 
events. Our corporate headquarters, a large portion of our current data center capacity, and a portion of our research and 
development activities are located in California, and other critical business operations, finished goods inventory and some 
of our suppliers are located in Asia, making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires 
or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on 
third-party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and 
personnel. Geopolitical and domestic political developments and other events beyond our control can increase economic 
volatility globally. Political instability, changes in government or adverse political developments in or around any of the 
major countries in which we do business may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Worldwide 
geopolitical tensions and conflicts, including but not limited to China, Hong Kong, Israel, Korea and Taiwan where the 
manufacture of our product components and final assembly of our products are concentrated may result in changing 
regulatory requirements, and other disruptions that could impact our operations and operating strategies, product 

demand, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. For example, other countries have restricted and may continue 
in the future to restrict business with the State of Israel, where we have engineering, sales support operations and 
manufacturing, and companies with Israeli operations, including by economic boycotts. Our operations could be harmed 
and our costs could increase if manufacturing, logistics, or other operations are disrupted for any reason, including 
natural disasters, high heat events, water shortages, power shortages, information technology system failures or cyberattacks, military actions or economic, and business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues. The ultimate 
impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers of being located and consolidated in certain geographical 
areas is unknown. In the event a disaster, war, or catastrophic event affects us, the third-party systems on which we rely, 
or our customers, our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, and substantial 
expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations. Our business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not 
be sufficient for all eventualities. All of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and 
operating results.
We are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the health and 
safety of our approximately 4,700 employees in the region who primarily support the research and development, 
operations, and sales and marketing of our networking products. Some of our employees in the region have been on 
active military duty for an extended period and may continue to be absent, which may cause disruption to our product 
development or operations. We have not experienced significant impact or expense to our business; however, if the 
conflict is further extended or expanded, it could impact future product development, operations, and revenue or create 
other uncertainty for our business.
Additionally, interruptions or delays in services from CSPs, data center co-location partners, and other third parties on 
which we rely, including due to the events described above or other events such as the insolvency of these parties, could 
impair our ability to provide our products and services and harm our business. As we increase our reliance on these thirdparty systems and services, our exposure to damage from service interruptions, defects, disruptions, outages, shortages 
and other performance and quality problems may increase. Data centers depend on access to clean water and predictable 
energy. Power or water shortages, land or permitting constraints, or regulations that limit energy, water, or land 
availability, could impair the ability of our customers to expand their data center capacity and consume our products and 
services, which may in turn negatively impact our business.
Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business.
Climate change may have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and on our customers, partners and vendors. 
Water and energy availability and reliability in the regions where we conduct business is critical, and certain of our 
facilities may be vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events. Extreme heat and wind coupled with dry 
conditions in Northern California may lead to power safety shut offs due to wildfire risk, which can have adverse 
implications for our Santa Clara, California headquarter offices and data centers, including impairing the ability of our 
employees to work effectively. Climate change, its impact on our supply chain and critical infrastructure worldwide and its 
potential to increase political instability in regions where we, our customers, partners and our vendors do business, may 
disrupt our business and cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and costs to maintain or resume operations. 
Although we maintain insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks, the types and amounts of 
insurance we obtain vary depending on availability and cost. Some of our policies have large deductibles and broad 
exclusions, and our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not covered by insurance may be 
large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.
Our business and those of our suppliers and customers may also be subject to climate-related laws, regulations and 
lawsuits. New or proposed regulations relating to carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, pollution limits, sustainability-related 
disclosure and governance and supply chain governance could result in greater direct costs, including costs associated 
with changes to manufacturing processes or the procurement of raw materials used in manufacturing processes, 
increased capital expenditures to improve facilities and equipment, higher compliance and energy costs to reduce 
emissions, other compliance costs, and greater indirect costs resulting from our customers and/or suppliers incurring 
additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs and restrictions could harm our business and results of 
operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our operations and product design activities. 
Stakeholder groups may find us insufficiently responsive to the implications of climate change, and therefore we may 
face legal action or reputational harm. We may not achieve our stated sustainability-related goals, which could harm our 
reputation, or we may incur additional, unexpected costs to achieve such goals. We may also experience contractual 
disputes due to supply chain delays arising from climate change-related disruptions, which could result in increased 
litigation and costs.
We also face risks related to business trends that may be influenced by climate change concerns. Our business could be 
negatively impacted by concerns around the high absolute energy requirements of our GPUs, despite their much more 
energy efficient design and operation relative to alternative computing platforms.
We may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, and we may not be able to 
successfully integrate acquired companies, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or 
sell our products.

We acquire and invest in businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand or 
enhance our strategic objectives. Acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our 
ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our 
financial results. If we pursue a particular transaction, we may limit our ability to enter into other transactions that could 
help us achieve our other strategic objectives. If we are unable to timely complete acquisitions, including due to delays 
and challenges in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to pursue other transactions, we may not be able to 
retain critical talent from the target company, technology may evolve and make the acquisition less attractive, and other 
changes can take place, which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our 
business. Regulators could also impose conditions that reduce the ultimate value of our acquisitions. In addition, to the 
extent that our perceived ability to consummate acquisitions has been harmed, future acquisitions may be more difficult, 
complex or expensive. Further, our investments in publicly traded companies could create volatility in our results and may 
generate losses up to the value of the investment. In addition, we have invested and may continue to invest in private 
companies to further our strategic objectives and to support certain key business initiatives. These companies can 
include early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction. Many of the instruments in which we invest are nonmarketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve a return. To the extent 
any of the companies in which we invest are not successful, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of 
our investment. Our investment portfolio contains industry sector concentration risks, and a decline in any one or 
multiple industry sectors could increase our impairment losses. 
We face additional risks related to acquisitions and strategic investments, including the diversion of capital and other 
resources, including management’s attention; difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties to realize the 
benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all; difficulty or inability in obtaining governmental, regulatory 
approval or restrictions or other consents and approvals or financing; legal proceedings initiated as a result of an 
acquisition or investment; and potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the 
assets or company in which we are investing or are acquiring.
Additional risks related to acquisitions include, but are not limited to:
difficulty in integrating the technology, systems, products, policies, processes, or operations and integrating and 
retaining the employees, including key personnel, of the acquired business;
assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of 
acquired assets;
integrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;
coordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate;
stock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition 
or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition;
potential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense, 
and compliance with debt covenants or other restrictions;
the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;
the potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;
negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target 
operate;
exposure to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities; and
impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s employees, vendors and customers.
For example, when integrating acquisition target systems into our own, we have experienced and may continue to 
experience challenges including lengthy and costly systems integration, delays in purchasing and shipping products, 
difficulties with system integration via electronic data interchange and other processes with our key suppliers and 
customers, and training and change management needs of integration personnel. These challenges have impacted our 
results of operations and may continue to do so in the future.
We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a 
concentration of sales to customers who purchase directly or indirectly from us, and our revenue could be adversely 
affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers.
We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, 
and this trend may continue. Sales to direct Customers A, B and C represented 12%, 11% and 11% of total revenue, 
respectively, for fiscal year 2025, all of which were primarily attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. With 

several of these partners, we are selling multiple products and systems in our portfolio through their channels. Our 
operating results depend on sales to our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that 
incorporate our technologies. We have a small number of partners that are involved in system integration with our key 
customers. As our system design becomes increasingly complex, system integrators may be unable to meet 
specifications of our key customers. Changes in our partners' or customers' business models or their ownership can 
reduce the number of partners available to us and harm our ability to sell our advanced data center systems to 
customers. In the future, these partners may decide to purchase fewer products, not to incorporate our products into 
their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way. Because most of our sales are made on a 
purchase order basis, our customers can generally cancel, change, or delay product purchase commitments with little 
notice to us and without penalty. Our partners or customers may develop their own solutions; our customers may 
purchase products from our competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for 
which they purchase our products, all of which may alter partners’ or customers’ purchasing patterns. Many of our 
indirect customers often do not purchase directly from us but through multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, 
distributors, and other channel partners. For fiscal year 2025, an indirect customer which primarily purchases our 
products through system integrators and distributors, including through Customer B, is estimated to represent 10% or 
more of total revenue, attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. If end demand increases or our finished 
goods supply availability is concentrated near a quarter end, the system integrators, distributors, and channel partners 
may have limited ability to increase their credit, which could impact the timing and amount of our revenue. The loss of any 
of our large customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. or 
other countries’ trade restrictions, or any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial 
condition and results of operations.
If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, our business may be harmed.
To remain competitive and successfully execute our business strategy, we must attract, retain, and motivate our 
executives and key employees, as well as recruit and develop exceptional and diverse talent. However, labor is subject to 
external factors that are beyond our control, including our industry’s highly competitive market for skilled workers and 
leaders, and workforce participation rates. Changes in immigration and work permit regulations, or in their administration 
or interpretation, could impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. Competition for talent drives up costs 
in the form of cash and stock-based compensation. In times of stock price volatility, as we have experienced in the past 
and may experience in the future, the retentive value of our stock-based compensation may decrease. Additionally, we are 
highly dependent on the services of our longstanding executive team. Failure to ensure effective succession planning, 
transfer of knowledge, and smooth transitions involving executives and key employees could hinder our strategic 
planning, execution, and long-term success.
Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our business processes and information systems and 
modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business and internal controls.
We rely upon internal processes and information systems to support key business functions, including our assessment of 
internal controls over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The efficient operation 
and scalability of these processes and systems is critical to support our growth. We continue to design and implement 
updated accounting functionality related to a new enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system. Any ERP system 
implementation may introduce problems, such as quality issues or programming errors, that could have an impact on our 
continued ability to successfully operate our business or to timely and accurately report our financial results. These 
changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time. 
Failure to implement new or updated controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our 
operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.
Identification of material weaknesses in our internal controls, even if quickly remediated once disclosed, may cause 
investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and our stock price may decline. Remediation of any material 
weakness could require us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to remediate any material weakness, our financial 
statements may be inaccurate, we may be required to restate our financial statements, our ability to report our financial 
results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected, our access to the capital markets may be restricted, our 
stock price may decline, and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities.
Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are 
below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.
Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate due to a number of factors. Therefore, 
investors should not rely on our past results of operations as an indication of our future performance. Factors that could 
affect our results of operations include, but are not limited to:
our ability to adjust spending due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services;
our ability to comply with our contractual obligations to customers;

our extended payment term arrangements with certain customers, the inability of some customers to make 
required payments, our ability to obtain credit insurance for customers with extended payment terms, and 
customer bad debt write-offs;
our vendors' payment requirements;
unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities; and
changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards.
Any of these factors could prevent us from achieving our anticipated financial results. For example, we have granted and 
may continue to grant extended payment terms to some customers, particularly during macroeconomic downturns, 
which could impact our ability to collect payment. Our vendors have requested and may continue to ask for shorter 
payment terms, which may impact our cash flow generation. These arrangements reduce the cash we have available for 
general business operations. In addition, the pace of growth in our operating expenses and investments may lag our 
revenue growth, creating volatility or periods where profitability levels may not be sustainable. Failure to meet our 
expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts is likely to cause our stock price to decline, as it has 
in the past, or substantial price volatility.
Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters
We are subject to complex laws, rules, regulations, and political and other actions, including restrictions on the export 
of our products, which may adversely impact our business.
We are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but not 
limited to, IP ownership and infringement; taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption, including 
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business acquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; 
foreign ownership and investment; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; 
product regulations; cybersecurity; environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; 
sustainability; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, 
could impact our competitive position, and may negatively impact our business operations and ability to manufacture and 
ship our products. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not 
violate applicable laws or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with 
such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on 
the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws, rules and regulations to which we are 
subject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement, could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs, 
and/or further restrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and operate our business. For example, 
we may face increased compliance costs as a result of changes or increases in antitrust legislation, regulation, 
administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks. Our position in 
markets relating to AI has led to increased interest in our business from regulators worldwide, including the European 
Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, South Korea and China. For example, the French Competition Authority 
collected information from us regarding our business and competition in the graphics card and cloud service provider 
market as part of an ongoing inquiry into competition in those markets. We have also received, and continue to receive, 
broad requests for information from competition regulators in the European Union, the United States, the United 
Kingdom, China, and South Korea regarding our sales of GPUs and other NVIDIA products, our efforts to allocate supply, 
foundation models and our investments, partnerships and other agreements with companies developing foundation 
models, the markets in which we compete and our competition, our strategies, roadmaps, and efforts to develop, market, 
and sell hardware, software, and system solutions, and our agreements with customers, suppliers, and partners. We 
expect to receive additional requests for information in the future. Such requests may be expensive and burdensome and 
could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers, suppliers, and partners.
Governments and regulators are also considering, and in certain cases, have imposed restrictions on the hardware, 
software, and systems used to develop frontier foundation models and generative AI. For example, the EU AI Act became 
effective on August 1, 2024 and will be fully applicable after a two-year transitional period. The EU AI Act may impact our 
ability to train, deploy, or release AI models in the EU. Several states are considering enacting or have already enacted 
regulations concerning AI technologies, which may impact our ability to train, deploy, or release AI models, and increase 
our compliance costs. Restrictions under these and any other regulations, if implemented, could increase the costs and 
burdens to us and our customers, delay or halt deployment of new systems using our products, and reduce the number of 
new entrants and customers, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Revisions to laws or regulations or 
their interpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase 
to import duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have 
an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our shipments. Additionally, changes in the public 
perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our business and 
results of operations.
Government actions, including trade protection and national and economic security policies of U.S. and foreign 
government bodies, such as tariffs, import or export regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on 

the activities of U.S. persons, trade and economic sanctions, decrees, quotas or other trade barriers and restrictions could 
affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export 
license with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s U.S. Entity List or other USG restricted parties lists (which is 
expected to change from time to time), and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect 
on our business. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable 
non-U.S. laws, even if the violation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available 
under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial 
condition.
For example, in response to the war in Ukraine, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and 
export control measures which blocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia, Belarus, and 
certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to Russia and closed business operations in Russia. 
Concurrently, the war in Ukraine has impacted sales in EMEA and may continue to do so in the future.
The increasing focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory restrictions that 
target products and services capable of enabling or facilitating AI and may in the future result in additional restrictions 
impacting some or all of our product and service offerings.
Concerns regarding third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests, including concerns 
relating to the misuse of AI applications, models, and solutions, has resulted in and could in the future result in unilateral 
or multilateral restrictions on products that can be used for training, modifying, tuning, and deploying LLMs and other AI 
applications. Such restrictions have limited and could in the future limit the ability of downstream customers and users 
worldwide to acquire, deploy and use systems that include our products, software, and services, and negatively impact 
our business and financial results.
Such restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology, 
including but not limited to AI technologies. As geopolitical tensions have increased, semiconductors associated with AI, 
including GPUs and related products, are increasingly the focus of export control restrictions proposed by stakeholders in 
the U.S. and its allies. The United States has imposed unilateral worldwide controls restricting GPUs and associated 
products, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted. Such controls have been and 
may again be very broad in scope and application, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one 
or more markets, including but not limited to China and over 150 countries designated “Tier 2” by the January 2025 AI 
Diffusion IFR, and could negatively impact our manufacturing, testing and warehousing locations and options, or could 
impose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad and could negatively and materially impact our 
business, revenue and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI, which 
have been imposed and are increasingly likely to be further tightened, would further restrict our ability to export our 
technology, products, or services even though competitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating a 
competitive disadvantage for us and negatively impacting our business and financial results. Export controls targeting 
GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI have subjected and may in the future subject downstream users of our 
products to additional restrictions on the use, resale, repair, or transfer of our products, negatively impacting our 
business and financial results. Controls could negatively impact our cost and/or ability to provide services such as NVIDIA 
AI cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our CSPs and customers to provide services to their end 
customers, even outside China.
Export controls could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve 
demand, including in markets outside China and for our gaming products. The possibility of additional export controls has 
negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact demand for our products, benefiting competitors that offer 
alternatives less likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated changes in the export control rules are likely to 
impose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially impacting our business.
Increasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our 
products or services, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Reduced demand due to export controls 
could also lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related supply charges. Additional unilateral or multilateral 
controls are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the ability of our research and 
development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner. Additional export restrictions may not 
only impact our ability to serve overseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including China, 
that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide our products and services to customers in all markets 
worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our revenue. Regulators in China have inquired about our sales and 
efforts to supply the China market and our fulfillment of the commitments we entered at the close of our Mellanox 
acquisition. For example, regulators in China are investigating whether complying with applicable U.S. export controls 
discriminates unfairly against customers in the China market. If regulators conclude that we have failed to fulfill such 
commitments or we have violated any applicable law in China, we could be subject to financial penalties, restrictions on 
our ability to conduct our business, restrictions regarding our networking products and services, or otherwise impact our 
operations in China, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and 
financial condition. 

Over the past three years, we have been subject to a series of shifting and expanding export control restrictions, 
impacting our ability to serve customers outside the United States.
During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions and export licensing requirements 
targeting China’s semiconductor and supercomputing industries. These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as 
well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop, produce and manufacture certain chips to China 
(including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any 
other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. The licensing requirements also apply to any 
future NVIDIA integrated circuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well 
as any system or board that includes those circuits. There are also now licensing requirements to export a wide array of 
products, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in China. During the 
second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 
and H100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.
In October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth 
quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to, Saudi 
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain performance 
thresholds, including, but not limited to, the A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing 
requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, 
or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. 
On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of 
our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products (removing the grace period granted by the official rule). Blackwell 
systems, such as GB200 NVL 72 and NVL 36 as well as B200 are also subject to these requirements and therefore require 
a license for any shipment to certain entities and to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5, excluding Israel. To date, 
we have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China.
On January 15, 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” IFR in the Federal Register. After a 120-day delayed compliance 
period, the IFR will, unless modified, impose a worldwide licensing requirement on all products classified under Export 
Control Classification Numbers, or ECCNs, 3A090.a, 4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, including all related software 
and technology. Any system that incorporates one or more of the covered integrated circuits, or ICs, (including but not 
limited to NVIDIA DGX, HGX, and MGX systems) will be covered by the new licensing requirement. The licensing 
requirement will include future NVIDIA ICs, boards, or systems classified with ECCN 3A090.a or 4A090.a, or 
corresponding .z ECCNs, achieving certain total processing performance and/or performance density.
Unless a license exception is available, the worldwide licensing requirements will apply to the following NVIDIA products, 
and any others we develop that meet the characteristics of 3A090.a or 4A090.a, including but not limited to: A100, A800, 
H100, H200, H800, B100, B200, GB200, L4, L40S, and RTX 6000 Ada. 
The AI Diffusion IFR would divide the world into three tiers, relegating most countries to “Tier 2” status. The AI Diffusion 
IFR would confer special benefits on select “Universal Verified End Users”, or UVEU, and lesser benefits on “National 
Verified End Users”, or NVEU. The AI Diffusion IFR would have numerous effects that may negatively impact our long-term 
financial results and competitive position, including but not limited to the following. 
The AI Diffusion IFR would reduce the market for U.S.-designed and manufactured computing products and services, by 
expressly limiting exports, reexports, and transfers of covered products to Tier 2 countries and companies in Tier 1 
countries that are either headquartered in Tier 2, or have an ultimate parent headquartered in a Tier 2 country. These 
restrictions would apply to all covered products, including products sold years ago.
The AI Diffusion IFR would limit access to the market for IT services and computing infrastructure, by favoring a select 
number of government-approved firms that achieve UVEU status. UVEUs may choose to favor their own accelerators, 
platforms, and systems, rather than selecting products based on merit.
The AI Diffusion IFR would encourage our customers to invest in alternatives that are not affected by USG regulations, 
including foreign competition.
The AI Diffusion IFR would increase our and our customers’ costs of doing business, creating compliance challenges and 
risks, and impact our supply and distribution chains, which will be subject to new compliance burdens and related 
extraterritorial regulatory obligations. 
The AI Diffusion IFR would expose U.S. providers and the U.S. industry to an enhanced risk of retaliation from other 
countries, in the form of tariffs, import/export controls, or other regulatory actions.
The AI Diffusion IFR’s licensing requirement could impact our ability to complete development of products in a timely 
manner, support existing customers using covered products, or supply customers with covered products outside the 
impacted regions, and may require us to transition certain operations out of one or more of the identified countries.

Following these 2022 export controls, we transitioned some operations, including certain testing, validation, and supply 
and distribution operations out of China and Hong Kong. Any future transitions could be costly and time consuming, and 
adversely affect our research and development and supply and distribution operations, as well as our revenue, during any 
such transition period. We expanded our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions, including those for which 
the USG does not require a license or advance notice before each shipment. To the extent that a customer requires 
products covered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer. However, the licensing process 
is time-consuming. We have no assurance that the USG will grant such a license or that the USG will act on the license 
application in a timely manner or at all. Even if a license is approved, it may impose burdensome conditions that we or our 
customer or end users cannot or decide not to accept. The USG evaluates license requests in a closed process that does 
not have clear standards or an opportunity for review. For example, the Notified Advanced Computing, or “NAC,” process 
has not resulted in approvals for exports of products to customers in China. The license process for exports to D1 and D4 
countries has been time-consuming and resulted in license conditions that are onerous, even for small-sized systems that 
are not able to train frontier AI models. The requirements have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and already have 
disadvantaged and may in the future disadvantage NVIDIA against certain of our competitors who sell products that are 
not subject to the new restrictions or may be able to acquire licenses for their products.
Our competitive position has been harmed by the existing export controls, and our competitive position and future 
results may be further harmed, over the long term, if there are further changes in the USG’s export controls, including 
further expansion of the geographic, customer, or product scope of the controls, if customers purchase product from 
competitors, if customers develop their own internal solution, if we are unable to provide contractual warranty or other 
extended service obligations, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant 
customers or if we incur significant transition costs. Even if the USG grants any requested licenses, the licenses may be 
temporary or impose burdensome conditions that we or our customers or end users cannot or choose not to fulfill. The 
licensing requirements may benefit certain of our competitors, as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and postsale technical support efforts more cumbersome and less certain and encourage customers in China to pursue 
alternatives to our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel.
Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again 
change the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and 
licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be 
unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the 
licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, 
including the Middle East and countries designated “Tier 2” by the AI Diffusion IFR. For example, the USG has already 
imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms to create and offer as a service large-scale GPU clusters, for 
example by imposing license conditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, and may impose 
additional conditions such as requiring chip tracking and throttling mechanisms that could disable or impair GPUs if 
certain events, including unauthorized system configuration, use, or location, are detected. The USG has already imposed 
export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands such controls to restrict additional gaming 
products, it may disrupt a significant portion of our supply and distribution chain and negatively impact sales of such 
products to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. In addition, as the performance of the gaming GPUs 
increases over time, export controls may have a greater impact on our ability to compete in markets subject to those 
controls. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our products, which 
are warehoused in and distributed from Hong Kong. Export controls restricting our ability to sell data center GPUs may 
also negatively impact demand for our networking products used in servers containing our GPUs. The USG may also 
impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of 
downstream parties to create large clusters for frontier model training. Any new control that impacts a wider range of 
our products would likely have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage us against certain of our 
competitors that sell chips that are outside the scope of such control. Excessive or shifting export controls have already 
and may in the future encourage customers outside China and other impacted regions to “design-out” certain U.S. 
semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they are able to serve 
markets worldwide. Excessive or shifting export controls have already encouraged and may in the future encourage 
overseas governments to request that our customers purchase from our competitors rather than NVIDIA or other U.S. 
firms, harming our business, market position, and financial results. As a result, excessive or shifting export controls may 
negatively impact demand for our products and services not only in China, but also in other markets, such as Europe, 
Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Excessive or shifting export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S. advanced 
semiconductor products, because by the time a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to new unilateral 
export controls restricting its sale. At the same time, such controls may increase investment in foreign competitors, 
which would be less likely to be restricted by U.S. controls. If additional products are subject to worldwide licensing 
requirements, we may incur significant inventory provisions and excess purchase obligation charges.
In addition to export controls, the USG may impose restrictions on the import and sale of products that incorporate 
technologies developed or manufactured in whole or in part in China. For example, the USG is considering restrictions on 
the import and sale of certain automotive products in the United States, which if adopted and interpreted broadly, could 
impact our ability to develop and supply solutions for our automotive customers.

Additionally, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games 
may adversely affect our Gaming revenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect 
our Data Center revenue. The Chinese government may also encourage customers to purchase from our China-based 
competitors, or impose restrictions on the sale to certain customers of our products, or any products containing 
components made by our partners and suppliers. For example, the Chinese government announced restrictions relating 
to certain sales of products containing certain products made by Micron, a supplier of ours. As another example, an 
agency of the Chinese government announced an Action Plan that endorses new standards regarding the compute 
performance per watt and per memory bandwidth of accelerators used in new and renovated data centers in China. If the 
Chinese government modifies or implements the Action Plan in a way that effectively prevents us from being able to 
design products to meet the new standard, this may restrict the ability of customers to use some of our data center 
products and may have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Further 
restrictions on our products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business and financial results.
Finally, our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially 
in Taiwan and South Korea. Any new restrictions that negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, 
or services from Taiwan and South Korea, would negatively impact our business and financial results.
Increased scrutiny from shareholders, regulators and others regarding our corporate sustainability practices could 
result in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation and willingness of customers and suppliers to do 
business with us.
Certain shareholder advocacy groups, investment funds, shareholders and other market participants, customers and 
government regulators have focused on corporate sustainability practices and disclosures, including those associated 
with climate change and human rights. Stakeholders may not be satisfied with our corporate sustainability practices and 
goals or the speed of their adoption. Further, there are state-level initiatives in the U.S. that may differ from other 
regulatory requirements or our various stakeholders’ expectations. Additionally, our corporate sustainability practices, 
oversight of our practices or disclosure controls may not meet evolving shareholder, regulator or other industry 
stakeholder expectations, or we may fail to meet corporate sustainability disclosure or reporting standards or legal 
requirements. We could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with 
various corporate sustainability practices and legal requirements, choose not to conduct business with potential 
customers and suppliers, or discontinue or not expand business with existing customers and suppliers due to our policies. 
These factors and increased disclosure may negatively harm our brand, reputation and business activities or expose us to 
liability.
Issues relating to the responsible use of our technologies, including AI in our offerings, may result in reputational or 
financial harm and liability.
Concerns relating to the responsible use of new and evolving technologies, such as AI, in our products and services may 
result in reputational or financial harm and liability and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such issues. We are 
increasingly building AI capabilities and protections into many of our products and services, and we also offer stand-alone 
AI applications. AI poses emerging legal, social, and ethical issues and presents risks and challenges that could affect its 
adoption, and therefore our business. If we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or 
actual impact on society, such as AI solutions that have unintended consequences, infringe copyright or rights of 
publicity, or are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment or other social, economic or 
political issues, or if we are unable to develop effective internal policies and frameworks relating to the responsible 
development and use of AI models and systems offered through our sales channels, we may experience brand or 
reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. Leveraging AI capabilities to potentially improve our internal 
functions and operations may present further risks, costs, and challenges. Complying with multiple regulations from 
different jurisdictions related to AI may further increase our cost of doing business, may change the way that we operate 
in certain jurisdictions, and may impede our ability to offer certain products and services in certain jurisdictions if we are 
unable to comply with regulations. Compliance with existing and proposed government regulation of AI, including in 
jurisdictions such as the European Union, may further increase the cost of related research and development, and create 
additional reporting and/or transparency requirements. For example, regulation adopted in response to the European 
Union Code of Practice for General Purpose Artificial Intelligence could require us to notify the European Commission 
regarding details of some of our Trustworthy AI processes related to our risk framework. Furthermore, changes in AIrelated regulation could disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change our business practices, 
which may negatively impact our financial results. Our failure to adequately address concerns and regulations relating to 
the responsible use of AI by us or others could undermine public confidence in AI and slow adoption of AI in our products 
and services or cause reputational or financial harm.
Actions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be 
harmed if we are unsuccessful or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.
From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other IP rights 
violations by us, our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify. An unfavorable ruling could include 
significant damages, invalidation of one or more patents, indemnification of third parties, payment of lost profits, or 
injunctive relief. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless of their merit, could 

cause us to incur significant costs to respond to, defend, and resolve such claims, and they may also divert the efforts 
and attention of management and technical personnel.
We may commence legal proceedings to protect our IP rights, which may increase our operating expenses. We could be 
subject to countersuits as a result. If infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a 
third party’s IP, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party’s IP rights. If we or one of our 
indemnitees is unable to obtain such a license on acceptable terms or at all, we could be subject to substantial liabilities 
or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products. We may also have to make 
royalty or other payments or cross license our technology. If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially 
reasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the indemnification of a customer or other 
indemnitee may increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results.
We rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing 
arrangements and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our IP. Foreign laws may not protect our 
products or IP rights to the same extent as United States law. This makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and 
products more likely. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential information 
could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in 
research and development, product development and marketing could be reduced. We also may face risks to our IP if our 
employees are hired by competitors. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing 
and new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be 
approved, and, if approved, whether they will be enforceable.
We are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations and other obligations. 
These areas could damage our reputation, deter current and potential customers, affect our product design, or result 
in legal or regulatory proceedings and liability.
We process sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, 
industry standards, external and internal policies, contracts and other obligations that govern the processing of such 
data by us and on our behalf. Concerns about our practices or the ultimate use of our products and services with regard 
to the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters, including 
for use in AI, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results. The theft, loss or 
misuse of personal data in our possession or by one of our partners could result in damage to our reputation, regulatory 
proceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased security or remediation costs and costs related to 
defending legal claims.
In the United States, federal, state and local authorities have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, including 
for data breach notification, personal data privacy and consumer protection. Numerous U.S. states have enacted 
comprehensive privacy laws that impose certain obligations on covered businesses, including providing specific 
disclosures in privacy notices and affording residents with certain rights concerning their personal data. As applicable, 
such rights may include the right to access, correct, or delete certain personal data, and to opt-out of certain data 
processing activities, such as targeted advertising, profiling and automated decision-making. The exercise of these rights 
may impact our business and ability to provide our products and services. Certain states also impose stricter 
requirements for processing certain personal data, including sensitive information, such as conducting data privacy 
impact assessments. These state laws allow for statutory fines for noncompliance. For example, the California Consumer 
Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, or collectively the CCPA, gives 
California residents the right to access, delete and opt-out of certain sharing of their personal information, and to receive 
detailed information about how it is used and shared. The CCPA provides for substantial fines for intentional violation and 
the law created a private right of action for certain data breaches. Similar laws are being considered in several other 
states, as well as at the federal and local levels. Additionally, several states and localities have enacted measures related 
to the use of AI and machine learning in products and services. If we become subject to additional data privacy laws, the 
risk of enforcement action against us could increase. 
Worldwide regulatory authorities are also considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data 
protection. The European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and the United Kingdom 
similarly adopted the U.K. GDPR, governing the strict handling of personal data of persons within the European Economic 
Area, or EEA, and the United Kingdom, respectively, including its use and protection and the ability of persons whose data 
is stored to access, correct, and delete such data about themselves. If we are found not to comply, we could be subject to 
penalties of up to €20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is greater, and classes of individuals or consumer 
protection organizations may initiate litigation related to our processing of their personal data. Furthermore, the EU AI 
Act and similar legislation could impose onerous obligations that may disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and 
require us to change our business practices. Additionally, Europe’s Network and Information Security Directive, or NIS2, 
regulates resilience and incident response capabilities of entities operating in a number of sectors, including the digital 
infrastructure sector. Non-compliance with NIS2 may lead to administrative fines of a maximum of 10 million Euros or up 
to 2% of the total worldwide revenue of the preceding fiscal year.
In the ordinary course of business, we transfer personal data from Europe, China, and other jurisdictions to the United 
States or other countries. Certain jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal data 

transfer laws. For example, the GDPR governs the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EEA. The 
European Commission released a set of “Standard Contractual Clauses” designed for entities to validly transfer personal 
data out of the EEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not found to provide an adequate level of 
protection, including the United States. Additionally, the U.K.’s International Data Transfer Agreement / Addendum, as 
well as the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the U.K. extension thereto (which allows for transfers to relevant U.S.-
based organizations who self-certify compliance and participate in the Framework) are mechanisms that may be used to 
transfer personal data from the EEA and U.K. to the United States. However, these mechanisms are subject to legal 
challenges, and there is no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to 
the United States. Other jurisdictions have enacted or are considering similar cross-border personal data transfer laws 
and local personal data residency laws, any of which would increase the cost and complexity of doing business and could 
result in fines from regulators. For example, China’s law imposes various requirements relating to data processing and 
data localization. Data broadly defined as important under China’s law, including personal data, may not be transferable 
outside of China without prior assessment and approval by the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC. Compliance 
with these requirements, including CAC assessments and any deemed failures of such assessments, could cause us to 
incur liability, prevent us from using data collected in China or impact our ability to transfer data outside of China. The 
inability to import personal data to the United States could significantly and negatively impact our business operations, 
limit our ability to collaborate with parties that are subject to European, China and other data privacy and security laws, or 
require us to increase our personal data processing capabilities in Europe and/or elsewhere at significant expense. Some 
European regulators have prevented companies from transferring personal data out of Europe for allegedly violating the 
GDPR’s cross-border data transfer limitations, which could negatively impact our business.
We are also bound by certain contractual obligations related to data privacy and security, and our efforts to comply with 
such obligations may not be successful or may be claimed to be non-compliant. For example, certain privacy laws, such as 
the GDPR and the CCPA, require our customers to impose specific contractual restrictions on their service providers. We 
sometimes host personal data in collaboration with our customers, and if a breach exposed or altered that personal data, 
it could harm those customer relationships and subject us to litigation, regulatory action, or fines. We publish privacy 
policies, marketing materials and other statements, such as compliance with certain certifications or self-regulatory 
principles, regarding data privacy and security. Regulators in the U.S. are increasingly scrutinizing these statements, and if 
these policies, materials or statements are found to be deficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair or 
misrepresentative of our practices, we may be subject to investigation, enforcement actions by regulators or other 
adverse consequences.
Data protection laws around the world are quickly changing and may be interpreted and applied in an increasingly 
stringent fashion and in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. These obligations may affect our product 
design and necessitate changes to our information technologies, systems and practices and to those of any third parties 
that process personal data on our behalf. Despite our efforts, we or third parties we rely upon may fail to comply with 
such obligations. If we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with data privacy and security obligations, 
we could face significant consequences, including but not limited to, government enforcement actions, litigation, 
additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, bans on processing personal data, and orders to destroy or not use 
personal data. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, or financial condition.
We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by changes in 
tax laws, higher than expected tax rates and other tax-related factors.
We are subject to complex income tax laws and regulations, as well as non-income-based taxes, in various jurisdictions. 
Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are 
regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, 
any adverse outcome could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed 
on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, net income, and cash flows.
Further, changes in tax laws or their interpretation by tax authorities in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions could increase our 
future tax liability or cause other adverse tax impacts, which may materially impact our results of operations, or the way 
we conduct our business. Most of our income is taxable in the U.S., with a significant portion qualifying for preferential 
treatment as foreign-derived intangible income, or FDII. If U.S. tax rates increase or the FDII deduction is reduced, our 
provision for income taxes, results of operations, net income, and cash flows would be adversely affected. In addition, our 
tax obligations and effective tax rate in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business could increase as a result of 
international tax developments, including the implementation of the Two-Pillar framework led by the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, which involves the reallocation of taxing rights in respect of certain 
multinational enterprises above a fixed profit margin to the jurisdictions in which they carry on business (referred to as 
Pillar One), and imposes a minimum effective corporate tax rate (referred to as Pillar Two). A number of countries in which 
we conduct business have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, elements of the Pillar Two rules. Any such tax laws, 
or changes in any such tax laws may increase tax uncertainty and compliance costs and adversely affect our provision for 
income taxes, cash tax payments, results of operations, and financial condition.
Our future effective tax rate may also be affected by a variety of factors, including changes in our business or statutory 
rates, the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, available tax incentives, credits and deductions, 

the expiration of statutes of limitations, changes in accounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization 
of tax returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, the estimates of our deferred tax assets and 
liabilities and deferred tax asset valuation allowances, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact 
of accounting for business combinations, as well as changes in the domestic or international organization of our business 
and structure. Furthermore, the tax effects of accounting for stock-based compensation and volatility in our stock price 
may significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period in which they occur. A decline in our stock price may result in 
reduced future tax benefits from stock-based compensation, increase our effective tax rate, and adversely affect our 
financial results.
Our business is exposed to the burden and risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.
We currently and will likely continue to face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and/or 
investigations involving shareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business. For example, we 
are defending a securities class action lawsuit from multiple shareholders asserting claims that we and certain of our 
officers made false and/or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining 
on GPU demand in 2017 and 2018. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings 
could occur, including monetary damages or fines, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain 
products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An 
unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can be 
costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations.
Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and agreement with Microsoft could delay or prevent a 
change in control.
The anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in 
control. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a 
majority of our outstanding stock. These provisions include the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue 
preferred stock, change the number of directors, and to make, amend or repeal our bylaws without prior shareholder 
approval; the inability of our shareholders to act by written consent; advance notice requirements for director 
nominations and shareholder proposals; and super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our 
certificate of incorporation and bylaws. Under our agreement with Microsoft for the Xbox, if someone makes an offer to 
purchase at least 30% of our outstanding common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase 
the stock. These provisions could delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA, discourage proxy contests, and make it 
more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they 
desire.
Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments
Not applicable.
Item 1C. Cybersecurity
Risk management and strategy
We have in place certain infrastructure, systems, policies, and procedures that are designed to proactively and reactively 
address circumstances that arise when unexpected events such as a cybersecurity incident occur. These include 
processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. Our information security 
management program generally follows processes outlined in frameworks such as the ISO 27001 international standard 
for Information Security and we evaluate and evolve our security measures as appropriate. We consult with external 
parties, such as cybersecurity firms and risk management and governance experts, on risk management and strategy.
Identifying, assessing, and managing cybersecurity risk is integrated into our overall risk management systems and 
processes, and we have in place cybersecurity and data privacy training and policies designed to (a) respond to new 
requirements in global privacy and cybersecurity laws and (b) prevent, detect, respond to, mitigate and recover from 
identified and significant cybersecurity threats.
We also have a vendor risk assessment process consisting of, depending on the nature and sensitivity of the supplier and 
data they process on our behalf, the distribution and review of supplier questionnaires designed to help us evaluate 
cybersecurity risks that we may encounter when working with third parties that have access to confidential and other 
sensitive company information. We take steps designed to ensure that such vendors have implemented data privacy and 
security controls that help mitigate the cybersecurity risks associated with these vendors, depending on the nature and 
sensitivity of the supplier and data they process on our behalf. We routinely assess our high-risk suppliers’ conformance 
to industry standards (e.g., ISO 27001, ISO 28001, and C-TPAT), and we evaluate them for additional information, product, 
and physical security requirements.
Refer to “Item 1A. Risk factors” in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information about cybersecurity-related 
risks.

Governance
Information security matters, including managing and assessing risks from cybersecurity threats, remain under the 
oversight of the Company’s Board of Directors, or the Board. The Audit Committee of the Board, or the Audit Committee, 
also reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company’s information security policies and practices and the 
internal controls regarding information security risks. The Audit Committee receives regular information security updates 
from management, including our Chief Security Officer and members of our security team. The Board also receives 
annual reports on information security matters from our Chief Security Officer and members of our security team.
Our security efforts are managed by a team of executive cybersecurity, IT, engineering, operations, and legal 
professionals. We have established a cross-functional leadership team, consisting of executive-level leaders, that meets 
regularly to review cybersecurity matters and evaluate emerging threats. With oversight and guidance provided by the 
cross-functional leadership team, our information security teams refine our practices to address emerging security risks 
and changes in regulations. Our executive-level leadership team also participates in cybersecurity incident response 
efforts by engaging with the incident response team and helping direct the company’s response to and assessment of 
certain cybersecurity incidents.
We have designated a Chief Security Officer that reports to our Senior Vice President of Software Engineering to manage 
our assessment and management of material risks from cybersecurity threats. Our Chief Security Officer’s cybersecurity 
expertise includes over 17 years of combined government and private sector assignments. 
Item 2. Properties
Our headquarters is in Santa Clara, California. We own and lease approximately 3 million square feet of office and building 
space for our corporate headquarters. In addition, we lease data center space in Santa Clara, California. We also own and 
lease facilities for data centers, research and development, and/or sales and administrative purposes throughout the U.S. 
and in various international locations, primarily in China, India, Israel, and Taiwan. We believe our existing facilities, both 
owned and leased, are in good condition and suitable for the conduct of our business. We do not identify or allocate 
assets by operating segment. For additional information regarding obligations under leases, refer to Note 17 of the Notes 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which information is 
hereby incorporated by reference.

Part II
Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of 
Equity Securities
Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol NVDA. Public trading of our common 
stock began on January 22, 1999. Prior to that, there was no public market for our common stock. As of February 21, 
2025, we had approximately 842 registered shareholders, not including those shares held in street or nominee name. 
In May 2024, we announced a ten-for-one stock split, or the Stock Split, of our issued common stock, which was effected 
through the filing of an amendment to the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, or the Amendment, with the 
Secretary of the State of Delaware. In June 2024, the Company filed the Amendment to effect the Stock Split and 
proportionately increased the number of shares of the Company’s authorized common stock from 8.0 billion to 80.0 
billion. Shareholders of record at the close of market on June 6, 2024 received nine additional shares of common stock, 
distributed after the close of market on June 7, 2024. All share, equity award and per share amounts presented herein 
have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the Stock Split.
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
On August 26, 2024, our Board of Directors approved an additional $50 billion to our share repurchase authorization, 
without expiration. In fiscal year 2025, we repurchased 310 million shares of our common stock for $34.0 billion. As of 
January 26, 2025, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase up to $38.7 billion of our common 
stock.
The repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading 
plan or in structured share repurchase agreements in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, subject to 

market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. Our share repurchase program may be suspended at 
any time at our discretion.
In fiscal year 2025, we paid cash dividends to our shareholders of $834 million. The payment of future cash dividends is 
subject to our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of 
our shareholders.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction 
with “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well as other cautionary 
statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase, hold, or sell 
shares of our common stock. 
Overview
Our Company and Our Businesses

focus on PC graphics, we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by 
the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU 
architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, AV, robotics, and digital twin applications.
Our two operating segments are "Compute & Networking" and "Graphics." Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in 
Delaware in April 1998.
Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges
Demand and Supply
Revenue growth in fiscal year 2025 was driven by data center compute and networking platforms for accelerated 
computing and AI solutions. Demand for our Hopper architecture drove our significant growth for the full year. We began 
shipping production systems of the Blackwell architecture in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025. 
Demand estimates for our products, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or 
supply levels. We may not be able to generate significant revenue from them. Advancements in accelerated computing 
and generative AI models, along with the growth in model complexity and scale, have driven increased demand for our 
Data Center systems.
We continue to increase our supply and capacity purchases with existing and new suppliers to support our demand 
projections and increasing complexity of our data center products. With these additions, we have also entered and may 
continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both current and future products. The 
increased purchase volumes and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our supply chain creates 
more complexity in managing multiple suppliers with variations in production planning, execution and logistics. Our 
expanding product portfolio and varying component compatibility and quality may lead to increased inventory levels. We 
have incurred and may in the future incur inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity 
commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.
Product Transitions and New Product Introductions
Product transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously as our 
channel partners prepare to ship and support new products. We are generally in various stages of transitioning the 
architectures of our Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive products. The computing industry is 
experiencing a broader and faster launch cadence of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing and diverse set 
of AI opportunities. We have introduced a new product and architecture cadence of our Data Center solutions where we 
seek to complete new computing solutions each year and provide a greater variety of Data Center offerings. The 
increased frequency of these transitions and the larger number of products and product configurations may magnify the 
challenges associated with managing our supply and demand which may further create volatility in our revenue. The 
increased frequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in quality or production issues that could 
increase inventory provisions, warranty, or other costs or result in product delays. We incur significant engineering 
development resources for new products, and changes to our product roadmap may impact our ability to develop other 
products or adequately manage our supply chain cost. Customers may delay purchasing existing products as we increase 
the frequency of new products or may not be able to adopt our new products as fast as forecasted, both impacting the 
timing of our revenue and supply chain cost. While we have managed prior product transitions and have sold multiple 
product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and 
impact our supply mix, and may cause us to incur additional costs.
Global Trade
In August 2022, the USG announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions, impact exports to China 
(including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or 
boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.

In July 2023, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products 
destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.
In October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth 
quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to Saudi 
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain performance 
thresholds, including, but not limited to, the A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing 
requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, 
or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed 
us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S 
products (removing the grace period granted by the official rule). Blackwell systems, such as GB200 NVL 72 and NVL 36 
as well as B200 are also subject to these requirements and therefore require a license for any shipment to certain entities 
and to China and Country Groups D1, D4 and D5, excluding Israel. To date, we have not received licenses to ship these 
restricted products to China. Additionally, we understand that partners and customers have also not received a license to 
ship these restricted products.
We expanded our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions, including those for which the USG does not 
require a license or advance notice before each shipment. We ramped new products designed specifically for China that 
do not require an export control license. Our Data Center revenue in China grew in fiscal year 2025. As a percentage of 
total Data Center revenue, it remains well below levels seen prior to the onset of export controls in October 2023. The 
market in China for datacenter solutions remains competitive. We will continue to comply with export controls while 
serving our customers. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the licensing requirements, we may 
seek a license for the customer but have no assurance that the USG will grant such a license, or that the USG will act on 
the license application in a timely manner or at all.
On January 15, 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” IFR in the Federal Register. After a 120-day delayed compliance 
period, the IFR will, unless modified, impose a worldwide licensing requirement on all products classified under Export 
Control Classification Numbers, or ECCNs, 3A090.a, 4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, including all related software 
and technology. Any system that incorporates one or more of the covered integrated circuits, or ICs, (including but not 
limited to NVIDIA DGX, HGX, and MGX systems) will be covered by the new licensing requirement. The licensing 
requirement will include future NVIDIA ICs, boards, or systems classified with ECCN 3A090.a or 4A090.a, or 
corresponding .z ECCNs, achieving certain total processing performance and/or performance density.
Unless a license exception is available, the worldwide licensing requirements will apply to the following NVIDIA products, 
and any others we develop that meet the characteristics of 3A090.a or 4A090.a, including but not limited to: A100, A800, 
H100, H200, H800, B100, B200, GB200, L4, L40S, and RTX 6000 Ada. 
Our competitive position has been harmed by the existing export controls, and our competitive position and future 
results may be further harmed, over the long term, if there are further changes in the USG’s export controls. Given the 
increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the 
export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing 
requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to 
sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing 
requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, including 
the Middle East and countries designated “Tier 2” by the AI Diffusion IFR. In addition to export controls, the USG may 
impose restrictions on the import and sale of products that incorporate technologies developed or manufactured in 
whole or in part in China. For example, the USG is considering restrictions on the import and sale of certain automotive 
products in the United States, which if adopted and interpreted broadly, could impact our ability to develop and supply 
solutions for our automotive customers.
While we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the AsiaPacific region, new and existing export controls or changes to existing export controls could limit alternative 
manufacturing locations and negatively impact our business. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to 
Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters” for a discussion of this potential impact.
Macroeconomic Factors
Macroeconomic factors, including  inflation, interest rate changes, capital market volatility, global supply chain 
constraints, tariffs, and global economic and geopolitical developments, may have direct and indirect impacts on our 
results of operations, particularly demand for our products. While difficult to isolate and quantify, these macroeconomic 
factors impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment and value of our 
investments. Our product and solution pricing generally does not fluctuate with short-term changes in our costs. Within 
our supply chain, we continuously manage product availability and costs with our vendors.

Israel and Regional Conflicts
We are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the health and 
safety of our approximately 4,700 employees in the region who primarily support the research and development, 
operations, and sales and marketing of our networking products. Our global supply chain for our networking products has 
not experienced any significant impact. Some of our employees in the region have been on active military duty for an 
extended period and may continue to be absent, which may cause disruption to our product development or operations. 
We have not experienced significant impact or expense to our business; however, if the conflict is further extended or 
expanded, it could impact future product development, operations, and revenue or create other uncertainty for our 
business.

We specialize in markets where our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications. These 
platforms incorporate processors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems, and services to deliver unique value. Our 
platforms address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and 
Automotive.
Revenue for fiscal year 2025 was $130.5 billion, up 114% from a year ago.
Data Center revenue for fiscal year 2025 was up 142% from a year ago. The strong year-on-year growth was driven by 
demand for our Hopper architecture accelerated computing platform used for large language models, recommendation 
engines, and generative AI applications. We began shipping production systems of the Blackwell architecture in the 
fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025.
Gaming revenue for fiscal year 2025 was up 9% from a year ago, driven by sales of our GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs. 
Professional Visualization revenue for fiscal year 2025 was up 21% from a year ago, driven by the continued ramp of Ada 
RTX GPU workstations for use cases such as generative AI-powered design, simulation, and engineering.
Automotive revenue for fiscal year 2025 was up 55% from a year ago, driven by sales of our self-driving platforms.
Gross margin increased in fiscal year 2025 driven by a higher mix of Data Center revenue. 
Operating expenses for fiscal year 2025 were up 45% from a year ago, driven by higher compensation and benefits 
expenses due to employee growth and compensation increases, and engineering development, compute and 
infrastructure costs for new product introductions. 
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the 
United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments 
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of 
contingencies. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty 
and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We have critical accounting 
estimates in the areas of inventories, income taxes, and revenue recognition. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of significant 
accounting policies.
Inventories
We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or 
for obsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relate 
to excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase 

commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions, which requires management 
judgment.
Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory or excess product purchase commitments include changes in 
business and economic conditions, changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our 
products, including potential cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders, inventory obsolescence because of 
changing technology and customer requirements, new product introductions resulting in less demand for existing 
products or inconsistent spikes in demand, failure to estimate customer demand properly, ordering in advance of 
historical lead-times, government regulations and the impact of changes in future demand, or increase in demand for 
competitive products, including competitive actions.
The net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an 
unfavorable impact of 2.3% in fiscal year 2025 and 2.7% in fiscal year 2024. Our inventory and capacity purchase 
commitments are based on forecasts of future customer demand and consider our third-party manufacturers' lead times 
and constraints. Our manufacturing lead times can be and have been long, and in some cases, extended beyond twelve 
months for some products. We may place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in advance of 
our historical lead times, pay premiums and provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. We also adjust to 
other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and 
macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.
Refer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further 
discussion.
Income Taxes
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is 
based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. 
Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an 
anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or 
changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax 
contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine 
that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may 
be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.
We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be 
realized based on all available evidence. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, 
we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.
We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon 
audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to 
unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue Allowances
For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for 
estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if 
product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional 
sales return allowances are required to reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Return rights for certain 
stocking distributors for specific products are contractually limited based on a percentage of prior quarter shipments. 
For shipments to other customers, we do not allow returns, although we may approve returns for credit or refund based 
on applicable facts and circumstances.
We account for customer programs, which involve rebates and marketing development funds, or MDFs, as a reduction in 
revenue and accrue for such programs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. Certain customer 
programs include distributor price incentives or other channel programs for specific products and customer classes 
which require judgement as to whether the applicable incentives will be attained. Estimates for customer program 
accruals include a combination of historical attainment and claim rates and may be adjusted based on relevant internal 
and external factors.
License and Development Arrangements
Revenue from License and Development Arrangements is recognized over the period in which the development services 
are performed. Each fiscal reporting period, we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as 
a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. Estimated total cost for each project 
includes a forecast of internal engineer personnel time expected to be incurred and other third-party costs as applicable.

Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations
Our contracts may contain more than one performance obligation. Judgement is required in determining whether each 
performance obligation within a customer contract is distinct. Except for License and Development Arrangements, 
NVIDIA products and services function on a standalone basis and do not require a significant amount of integration or 
interdependency. Therefore, multiple performance obligations contained within a customer contract are considered 
distinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes.
We allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in an arrangement with multiple 
performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. In certain cases, we can establish standalone selling 
price based on directly observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar 
customers. If standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell a product or service 
separately, we determine standalone selling price based on market data and other observable inputs.
Results of Operations
A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal year 2024 
is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2024 compared 
to fiscal year 2023 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 
2024, filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at http://

Compute & Networking revenue – The year over year increase was due to strong demand for our accelerated computing 
and AI solutions. Revenue from Data Center computing grew 162% driven primarily by demand for our Hopper computing 
platform used for large language models, recommendation engines, and generative AI applications. Revenue from Data 
Center networking grew 51% driven by Ethernet for AI revenue, which includes Spectrum-X end-to-end ethernet 
platform.
Graphics revenue – The year over year increase was driven by sales of our GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs.
Reportable segment operating income – The year over year increase in Compute & Networking segment operating income 
was driven by growth in revenue. The year over year decrease in Graphics segment operating income was driven by an 
increase of 44% in segment operating expenses, partially offset by growth in revenue.
All Other operating loss – The year over year increase was due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense 
reflecting employee growth and compensation increases.
Concentration of Revenue
We refer to customers who purchase products directly from NVIDIA as direct customers, such as AIBs, distributors, 
ODMs, OEMs, and system integrators. We have certain customers that may purchase products directly from NVIDIA and 
may use either internal resources or third-party system integrators to complete their build. We also have indirect 
customers, who purchase products through our direct customers; indirect customers include CSPs, consumer internet 
companies, enterprises, and public sector entities.
Direct Customers – Sales to direct customers which represented 10% or more of total revenue, all of which were primarily 
attributable to the Compute & Networking segment, are presented in the following table:
Year Ended

Jan 28, 2024
Direct Customer A

Direct Customer B
 11 %
 13 %
Direct Customer C

* Less than 10% of total revenue.
No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal year 2023.

Indirect Customers – Indirect customer revenue is an estimation based upon multiple factors including customer purchase 
order information, product specifications, internal sales data, and other sources. Actual indirect customer revenue may 
differ from our estimates. For fiscal year 2025, an indirect customer which primarily purchases our products through 
system integrators and distributors, including through Direct Customer B, is estimated to represent 10% or more of total 
revenue, attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.
We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, 
and this trend may continue.
Revenue by geographic region is designated based on the billing location even if the revenue may be attributable to 
indirect customers in a different location. Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 
53% and 56% of total revenue for fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin
Gross profit consists of total net revenue less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of 
semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing 
support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and 
warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes acquisitionrelated intangible amortization expense, costs for license and development and service arrangements, IP-related costs, 
and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing operations.
Gross margins increased to 75.0% in fiscal year 2025 from 72.7% in fiscal year 2024. The year over year increase was 
primarily driven by a higher mix of Data Center revenue.
Provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $3.7 billion and $2.2 billion for fiscal years 
2025 and 2024, respectively. Sales of previously reserved inventory and settlements of excess inventory purchase 
obligations resulted in a provision release of $689 million and $540 million for fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. 
The net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 2.3% and 2.7% in fiscal years 2025 and 2024, 
respectively.

The increase in interest income was primarily due to growth in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.
Interest expense is comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our notes.
Other, net consists of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in non-marketable equity securities, 
publicly-held equity securities, and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. The change in Other, net, compared 
to fiscal year 2024, was primarily driven by an increase in fair value of our non-marketable equity securities and publiclyheld equity securities. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this 
Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our non-marketable equity securities.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense was $11.1 billion and $4.1 billion for fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. Income tax as a 
percentage of income before income tax was an expense of 13.3% and 12.0% for fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively.
The effective tax rate increased primarily due to higher pre-tax income and a prior year discrete benefit due to an audit 
resolution.
Our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2025 and 2024 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily 
to tax benefits from the FDII deduction, stock-based compensation, the U.S. federal research tax credit, and income 
earned in jurisdictions that are subject to taxes at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate. Our effective tax 
rate for fiscal year 2024 was additionally benefited by the audit resolution.
Given our current and possible future earnings, we believe that we may release the valuation allowance associated with 
certain state deferred tax assets in the near term, which would decrease our income tax expense for the period the 
release is recorded. The timing and amount of the valuation allowance release could vary based on our assessment of all 
available information.

Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment 
types and credit exposures, and certain maturity limits on our portfolio.

Cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal year 2024, due to growth in 
revenue.
Cash used in investing activities increased in fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal year 2024, primarily driven by net 
purchases of marketable securities, and purchase of land, property and equipment.
Cash used in financing activities increased in fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal year 2024, mainly due to higher share 
repurchases and higher tax payments related to RSUs.
Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity include cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated by our 
operations. As of January 26, 2025, we had $43.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. We believe 
that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months and thereafter 
for the foreseeable future, including our future supply obligations and share purchases. We continuously evaluate our 
liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance future capital 
requirements.
Our marketable securities consist of publicly-held equity securities, debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its 
agencies, highly rated corporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, as well as certificates of 
deposit issued by highly rated financial institutions. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. 
Refer to Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on 
Form 10-K for additional information.
Except for approximately $1.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for which 
we have not accrued any related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S., substantially all of our 
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside the U.S. at the end of fiscal year 2025 are available for use 
in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes.
Capital Return to Shareholders
On August 26, 2024, our Board of Directors approved an additional $50 billion to our share repurchase authorization, 
without expiration. In fiscal year 2025, we repurchased 310 million shares of our common stock for $34.0 billion. As of 
January 26, 2025, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase up to $38.7 billion of our common 
stock. 
From January 27, 2025 through February 21, 2025, we repurchased 29 million shares for $3.7 billion pursuant to a preestablished trading plan. Our share repurchase program aims to offset dilution from shares issued to employees while 
maintaining adequate liquidity to meet our operating requirements. We may pursue additional share repurchases as we 
weigh market factors and other investment opportunities.
In fiscal year 2025, we paid cash dividends to our shareholders of $834 million. The payment of future cash dividends is 
subject to our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of 
our shareholders.
The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 requires a 1% excise tax on certain share repurchases in excess of shares issued 
for employee compensation made after December 31, 2022. The excise tax is included in our share repurchase cost and 
was not material for fiscal years 2025 and 2024.

10-K for further discussion.
Material Cash Requirements and Other Obligations
For a description of our long-term debt, purchase obligations, and operating lease obligations, refer to Note 11, Note 12, 
and Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K, respectively.
During fiscal year 2025 and fiscal year 2024, we spent $3.4 billion and $1.1 billion on capital expenditures, respectively. 
We expect to increase capital expenditures in fiscal year 2026 relative to fiscal year 2025 to support the future growth of 
our business.
Unrecognized tax benefits of $2.2 billion, which includes related interest and penalties of $251 million, were recorded in 
non-current income tax payable at the end of fiscal year 2025. We are unable to estimate the timing of any potential tax 
liability, interest payments, or penalties in individual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and 
the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions. Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
Climate Change
To date, there has been no material impact to our results of operations associated with global sustainability regulations, 
compliance, costs from sourcing renewable energy or climate-related business trends.
Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on 
Form 10-K for a discussion of adoption of new and recently issued accounting pronouncements.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
Investment and Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The investment 
portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and growth of 
our businesses.
As of the end of fiscal year 2025, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio. According to our 
analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 0.5% would result in a change in fair value for these investments 
of $238 million.
As of the end of fiscal year 2025, we had $8.5 billion of senior Notes outstanding. We carry the Notes at face value less 
unamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we have no financial 
statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 
Foreign Exchange Rate Risk
We consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal as substantially all of our sales are in 
United States dollars and foreign currency forward contracts are used to offset movements of foreign currency 
exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expenses. The 
impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 
2025 and 2024.
Sales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, 
therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to 
other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. 
Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers 
raising their manufacturing costs.
If the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10% as of January 26, 2025 and January 28, 2024, the amount recorded in accumulated 
other comprehensive income (loss) related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been $136 
million and $116 million lower, respectively. Change in value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 
would be expected to offset a corresponding change in hedged forecasted foreign currency expenses when recognized.
If an adverse 10% foreign exchange rate change was applied to our balance sheet hedging contracts, it would have 
resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of $129 million and $60 million as of January 26, 2025 and 
January 28, 2024, respectively. These changes in fair values would be offset in other income (expense), net by 

corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, assuming the 
hedge contracts fully cover the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities balances.

Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on their evaluation as of January 26, 2025, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the 
Exchange Act) were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information we are required to disclose in reports 
that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods 
specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, 
including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding 
required disclosures.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as 
such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our 
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the 
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 26, 2025 based on the criteria set forth in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission. Based on our evaluation under the criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework, our 
management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 26, 2025.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 26, 2025 has been audited by 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included 
herein.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended January 26, 2025 
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In 
fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our ERP system, which will update much of our existing core financial systems. 
The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records used to report operating results. The upgrade will 
occur in phases. We will continue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes that materially affect our internal 
control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure 
controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well 
conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system 
are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the 
benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, 
no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within 
NVIDIA have been detected.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of NVIDIA Corporation
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries (the 
“Company”) as of January 26, 2025 and January 28, 2024, and the related consolidated statements of income, 
comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 26, 
2025, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) 
(collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control 
over financial reporting as of January 26, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial 
position of the Company as of January 26, 2025 and January 28, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows 
for each of the three years in the period ended January 26, 2025 in conformity with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective 
internal control over financial reporting as of January 26, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control - 
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal 
control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, 
included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our 
responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal 
control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company 
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in 
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of 
material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was 
maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material 
misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that 
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and 
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used 
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated 
financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal 
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design 
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such 
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis 
for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and 
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are 
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of 
management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely 
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the 
financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. 
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may 
deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated 
financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates 
to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially 
challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our 
opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit 
matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it 
relates.
Valuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories and Excess Product Purchase Commitments
As described in Notes 1, 9 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for 
inventory provisions to write-down inventory for excess or obsolete inventory and for excess product purchase 
commitments. Most of the Company’s inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on the 
Company’s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand 
and market conditions. As of January 26, 2025, the Company’s consolidated inventories balance was $10.1 billion and the 
Company’s consolidated outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations balance was 
$30.8 billion, of which a significant portion relates to inventory purchase obligations.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories, 
specifically the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, is a critical audit 
matter are the significant judgment by management when developing provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and 
excess product purchase commitments, including developing assumptions related to future demand and market 
conditions. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and 
evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our 
overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls 
relating to management’s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, 
including controls over management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. These procedures 
also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete 
inventories and excess product purchase commitments; evaluating the appropriateness of management’s approach; 
testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach; and evaluating the reasonableness of 
management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. Evaluating management’s assumptions 
related to future demand and market conditions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were 
reasonable considering (i) current and past results, including historical product life cycle, (ii) the consistency with external 
market and industry data, and (iii) changes in technology.

Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Our Company
Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in 
Delaware in April 1998.
All references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries.
Certain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.
In June 2024, we executed a ten-for-one stock split of our common stock. All share, equity award, and per share amounts 
and related shareholders' equity balances presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Stock Split.
Fiscal Year
We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023 were all 52week years.
Principles of Consolidation
Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All 
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. 
Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those 
related to accounts receivable, cash equivalents and marketable securities, goodwill, income taxes, inventories and 
product purchase commitments, investigation and settlement costs, litigation, non-marketable equity securities, other 
contingencies, property, plant, and equipment, restructuring and other charges, revenue recognition, and stock-based 
compensation. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are 
reasonable.
Revenue Recognition
We derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, 
software licensing, and cloud services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification 
of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the 
transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (where revenue is 
allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the 
standalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a 
performance obligation. Payment from customers, per our standard payment terms, is generally due shortly after delivery 
of products, availability of software licenses or commencement of services.
Product Sales Revenue
Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflects 
the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold with support or an 
extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support and extended warranty revenue are 
recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for 
returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.
For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for 
estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if 
product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional 
sales return allowances are required to accurately reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.
Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in 
various target markets, and MDFs which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment 
development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for 
customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for such programs for potential rebates and MDFs based on the 
amount we expect to be claimed by customers.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

License and Development Arrangements
Our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP 
components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a 
single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure progress to 
completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each 
project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.
Software Licensing
Our software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. 
Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over 
which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with support, which includes 
the right to receive, on a when-and-if available basis, future unspecified software updates and upgrades. Revenue from 
software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. Software support revenue 
is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.
Cloud Services
Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software and hardware infrastructure without taking possession of 
the software or hardware, are provided on a subscription basis or a combination of subscription plus usage. Revenue 
related to subscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud 
services based on usage is recognized as usage occurs. Cloud services are typically sold on a standalone basis, but certain 
offerings may be sold with hardware and/or software and related support.
Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations
Our contracts may contain more than one of the products and services listed above, each of which is separately 
accounted for as a distinct performance obligation. We account for multiple agreements with a single customer as a 
single contract if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely 
related that they are, in effect, parts of a single contract.
We allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in an arrangement with multiple 
performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. The standalone selling price reflects the price we 
would charge for a specific product or service if it were sold separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. 
When determining standalone selling price, we maximize the use of observable inputs.
Product Warranties
We offer a limited warranty to end-users ranging from one to three years for products to repair or replace products for 
manufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product 
warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an 
extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification 
issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.
Stock-based Compensation
We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair 
value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units, or PSUs, that are based on our corporate 
financial performance targets. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of PSUs 
that are based on our stock performance compared to market performance, or market-based PSUs. The compensation 
expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite 
employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model 
based on performance targets probable of achievement. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our 
employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in 
March and September of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated 
amortization model. Additionally, for RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs, we estimate expected forfeitures based on our 
historical forfeitures.
Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs
We currently, are, and will likely continue to be subject to claims, litigation, and other actions, including potential 
regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, 
competition and antitrust, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. 
There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions 
or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments or 
judgments. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, 

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(Continued)

investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will 
record the loss. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our 
estimates, which could require us to record additional costs. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the 
loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss.
Foreign Currency Remeasurement
We use the U.S. dollar as our functional currency for our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are 
remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as 
property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured 
at exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to non-monetary balance sheet 
amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are 
included in earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been significant.
Income Taxes
We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or 
refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or 
liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; 
and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on 
available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.
Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing 
with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change 
based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in 
the U.S., or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize 
liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to 
which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax 
liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income 
tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.
As of January 26, 2025, we had a valuation allowance of $1.6 billion related to capital loss carryforwards, and certain state 
and other deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional 
projections of future taxable income, including capital gains. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes 
more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.
We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon 
audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to 
unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.
Net Income Per Share
Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the 
period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive 
shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Any anti-dilutive effect of equity awards 
outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share.
Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities
We consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three 
months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt 
investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased and publicly-held equity securities. We 
classify these investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current 
operations.
We classify our cash equivalents and marketable debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. These 
available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in 
accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. The fair value of 
interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest. Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities 
are determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the Other income (expense), net, section of our 
Consolidated Statements of Income.
Available-for-sale debt securities are subject to impairment review. If the estimated fair value of available-for-sale debt 
securities is less than its amortized cost basis, we determine if the difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses 
and write-down the amortized cost basis of the securities if it is more likely than not we will be required or we intend to 

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(Continued)

sell the securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are 
recognized in the Other income (expense), net section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.
Publicly-held equity securities have readily determinable fair values with changes in fair value recorded in Other income 
(expense), net.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair 
values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 26, 2025 and January 28, 2024. Marketable debt and equity 
securities are reported at fair value based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are recognized as either 
assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on 
the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized 
in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the 
risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges, the effective portion of the gains or 
losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently 
recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments not designated as 
accounting hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, 
marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income 
securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and includes certain limits on our portfolio 
maturities. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and maintain an allowance for 
potential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on 
overall estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of 
credit.
Inventories
Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, firstout basis. Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing 
and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test 
yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts. We 
charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for 
obsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relate to 
excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to 
assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it 
creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up. We record a liability for noncancelable 
purchase commitments with suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our 
valuation of obsolete or excess inventory.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is 
computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets of two to seven years. Once 
an asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are 
removed, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years. Depreciation 
expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded 
under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.
Leases
We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 
months are included in operating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease 
liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the 
lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the lease term.
Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments 
discounted using our incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and 
prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease 
when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(Continued)

Goodwill
Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of 
potential impairment exist. In completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative 
analysis on a reporting unit basis.
Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events 
and factors affecting the reporting units.
The quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting 
unit’s fair value. The income and market valuation approaches consider factors that include, but are not limited to, 
prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly 
traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic 
factors and the future profitability of our business.
Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets
Intangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology and customer 
relationships, as well as rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, and acquired IP. We currently amortize our 
intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from one to twenty years using a method that reflects the pattern 
in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be 
reliably determined, using a straight-line amortization method.
Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for 
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group 
may not be recoverable. The recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of 
the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated 
by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an 
impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the 
estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash 
flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately 
presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair 
value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated.
Business Combination
We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and 
intangible assets acquired, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over 
the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Management’s estimates of 
fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions are inherently 
uncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions used in valuing intangible assets include, but are not 
limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, discount rate used to determine the present value of 
these cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from 
the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, we may 
record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the 
measurement period's conclusion or final determination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, 
whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our Consolidated Statements of Income.
Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.
Non-Marketable Equity Securities
Non-marketable equity securities consist of investments in privately-held companies that do not have a readily 
determinable fair value. These investments are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, and are adjusted for changes 
resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer, 
or the measurement alternative. Fair value is based upon observable inputs in an inactive market and the valuation 
requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. All gains and losses on these 
investments, realized and unrealized, are recognized in other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of 
Income. 
We assess whether an impairment loss has occurred on our investments in non-marketable equity securities, accounted 
for under the measurement alternative based on quantitative and qualitative factors. If any impairment is identified for 
non-marketable equity securities, we write down the investment to its fair value and record the corresponding charge 
through other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement 
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued a new accounting standard requiring 
disclosures of significant expenses in operating segments. We adopted this standard in our fiscal year 2025 annual 
report. Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report 
on Form 10-K for further information.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In December 2023, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which includes new and updated income tax disclosures, 
including disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. We expect to adopt this 
standard in our fiscal year 2026 annual report. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact 
on our Consolidated Financial Statements other than additional disclosures.
In November 2024, the FASB issued a new accounting standard requiring disclosures of certain additional expense 
information on an annual and interim basis, including, among other items, the amounts of purchases of inventory, 
employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization included within each income statement expense 
caption, as applicable. We expect to adopt this standard in our fiscal year 2028 annual report. We do not expect the 
adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements other than additional 
disclosures.
Note 2 - Business Combination
Termination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement
In February 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank Group Corp, or SoftBank, announced the termination of the Share Purchase 
Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired Arm from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate it due to 
significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. We recorded an acquisition termination 
cost of $1.4 billion in fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing.
Note 3 - Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation expense is associated with RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs, and our ESPP.

ESPP.
The fair value of shares issued under our ESPP have been estimated with the following assumptions:

For ESPP shares, the expected term represents the average term from the first day of the offering period to the 
purchase date. The risk-free interest rate assumption used to value ESPP shares is based upon observed interest rates on 
Treasury bills appropriate for the expected term. Our expected stock price volatility assumption for ESPP is estimated 
using historical volatility. For awards granted, we use the dividend yield at grant date. Our RSUs, PSUs, and market-based 
PSUs are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair values of RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs 
are discounted for the dividend yield.
Additionally, for RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs, we estimate expected forfeitures based on our historical 
forfeitures.
Equity Incentive Program
We grant RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs, and stock purchase rights under the following equity incentive plans. In 
addition, in connection with our acquisitions of various companies, we have assumed certain stock-based awards granted 
under their stock incentive plans and converted them into our RSUs.
Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan
In 2007, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, or as most recently amended and 
restated, the 2007 Plan.
The 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, 
stock appreciation rights, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other stock-based awards to 
employees, directors and consultants. Only our employees may receive incentive stock options. We grant RSUs, PSUs and 
market-based PSUs under the 2007 Plan. As of January 26, 2025, up to 274 million shares of our common stock could be 
issued pursuant to stock awards granted under the 2007 Plan, and 1.4 billion shares were available for future grants.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(Continued)

Subject to certain exceptions, RSUs vest generally over four years subject to continued service. PSUs vest over four years, 
subject to continued service and performance conditions. Market-based PSUs vest on the third anniversary of the date of 
grant subject to market conditions. However, the number of shares subject to both PSUs and market-based PSUs that 
are eligible to vest is determined by the Compensation Committee based on achievement of pre-determined criteria.
Amended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In 2012, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or as most recently 
amended and restated, the 2012 Plan.
Employees who participate in the 2012 Plan may have up to 15% of their earnings withheld to purchase shares of 
common stock. Starting in March 2025, employees may have up to 25% of their earnings withheld to purchase shares of 
common stock. The Board may decrease this percentage at its discretion. Each offering period is about 24 months, 
divided into four purchase periods of six months. The price of common stock purchased under our 2012 Plan will be equal 
to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the commencement date of each offering period or 
the fair market value of the common stock on each purchase date within the offering. As of January 26, 2025, we had 
2.2 billion shares reserved for future issuance under the 2012 Plan.

Net realized gains on investments in publicly-held equity securities sold were $88 million for fiscal year 2025, reflecting 
the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying value of the equity securities at the beginning of the period or 
the purchase date, if later. Realized gains and losses on investments in publicly-held equity securities sold during fiscal 
years 2024 and 2023 were not significant.

We recognized revenue of $729 million and $338 million in fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively, that were included in 
the prior year end deferred revenue balance.
As of January 26, 2025, revenue related to remaining performance obligations from contracts greater than one year in 
length was $1.7 billion, which includes $1.6 billion from deferred revenue and $151 million which has not yet been billed 
nor recognized as revenue. Approximately 39% of revenue from contracts greater than one year in length will be 
recognized over the next twelve months.
Note 10 - Derivative Financial Instruments
We utilize foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on 
our operating expenses. The foreign currency forward contracts for operating expenses are designated as accounting 
hedges. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and 
reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings. In fiscal years 2025 
and 2024, the impact of foreign currency forward contracts designated as accounting hedges on other comprehensive 
income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective.
We also entered into foreign currency forward contracts mitigating the impact of foreign currency movements on 
monetary assets and liabilities. For our foreign currency contracts for assets and liabilities, the change in fair value of 
these non-designated contracts was recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the 
hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which was also recorded in other income or 
expense.
The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency contracts outstanding:

The unrealized gains and losses or fair value of our foreign currency contracts were not significant as of January 26, 2025 
and January 28, 2024.
As of January 26, 2025, all foreign currency contracts mature within 18 months. The expected realized gains and losses 
deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to foreign currency forward contracts within the 
next twelve months were not significant.

Purchase Obligations
Our purchase obligations reflect our commitment to purchase components used to manufacture our products, including 
long-term supply and capacity agreements, certain software and technology licenses, other goods and services and longlived assets.
As of January 26, 2025, we had outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations totaling 
$30.8 billion, an increase from the prior year led by commitments, capacity and components for new product 
introductions, including our new Blackwell architecture. We enter into agreements with contract manufacturers that 
allow them to procure inventory based upon our defined criteria, and in certain instances, these agreements are 
cancellable, able to be rescheduled, or adjustable for our business needs prior to placing firm orders. Though, changes to 
these agreements may result in additional costs. Other non-inventory purchase obligations were $14.3 billion, including 
$10.9 billion of multi-year cloud service agreements. We expect our cloud service agreements to primarily be used to 
support our research and development efforts, as well as our DGX Cloud offerings.

recorded any liability in our Consolidated Financial Statements for such indemnifications.
Litigation
Securities Class Action and Derivative Lawsuits 
The plaintiffs in the putative securities class action lawsuit, captioned 4:18-cv-07669-HSG, initially filed on December 21, 
2018 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and titled In Re NVIDIA Corporation 
Securities Litigation, filed an amended complaint on May 13, 2020. The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and 
certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange 
Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact 
of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also alleged that the 
NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class 
certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including 
attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district 
court granted NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the complaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and 
closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from judgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the 
Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. On August 25, 2023, a majority of a three-judge Ninth Circuit panel affirmed in part 
and reversed in part the district court’s dismissal of the case, with a third judge dissenting on the basis that the district 
court did not err in dismissing the case. On November 15, 2023, the Ninth Circuit denied NVIDIA’s petition for rehearing 
en banc of the Ninth Circuit panel’s majority decision to reverse in part the dismissal of the case, which NVIDIA had filed 
on October 10, 2023. On December 5, 2023, the Ninth Circuit granted NVIDIA’s motion to stay the mandate pending 
NVIDIA’s petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States and the Supreme Court’s final 
disposition of the matter. NVIDIA filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on March 4, 2024. On June 17, 2024, the Supreme 
Court of the United States granted NVIDIA’s petition for a writ of certiorari. After briefing and argument, the Supreme 

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(Continued)

Court dismissed NVIDIA’s writ of certiorari as improvidently granted on December 11, 2024, and issued judgment on 
January 13, 2025. On February 20, 2025, the Ninth Circuit’s judgment, entered August 25, 2023 and corrected August 28, 
2023, took effect, and the case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings.
The putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, 
captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, initially filed January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative 
Litigation, was stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation 
action. On February 22, 2022, the court administratively closed the case, but stated that it would reopen the case once 
the appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action is resolved. The case has not yet been reopened by 
the court. The lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company 
for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 
20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel 
inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and 
other relief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA’s corporate governance and internal procedures.
The putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court for the 
District of Delaware, Lipchitz v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-MN) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 1:19cv-01798-MN), were stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities 
Litigation action. On February 5, 2025, after the Supreme Court issued its judgment dismissing the Company’s petition 
for writ of certiorari as improvidently granted in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action, the district 
court extended the stay for 30 days while the parties discuss next steps and ordered the parties to file a joint status 
report by March 7, 2025. The lawsuits assert claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of 
the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of information, corporate 
waste and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false, 
and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The 
plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and 
unspecified corporate governance measures.
Another putative derivative action was filed on October 30, 2023 in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, 
captioned Horanic v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 2023-1096-KSJM). This lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, 
against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty and insider trading based on the 
dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of 
cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement 
of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and reform of unspecified corporate governance measures. This derivative 
matter is stayed pending the final resolution of In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action.
Accounting for Loss Contingencies
As of January 26, 2025, there are no accrued contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above 
based on our belief that liabilities, while reasonably possible, are not probable. Further, any possible loss or range of loss in 
these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising 
in the ordinary course of business and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the 
ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial 
position.

Net deferred tax asset includes long-term deferred tax assets of $11 billion and $6.1 billion and long-term deferred tax liabilities of $886 million and 
$462 million for fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. Long-term deferred tax liabilities are included in other long-term liabilities on our 
Consolidated Balance Sheets.
As of January 26, 2025, we intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately $1.4 billion of cumulative undistributed earnings 
held by certain subsidiaries. We have not provided the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary 
differences related to these investments as the determination of such amount is not practicable.
As of both January 26, 2025 and January 28, 2024, we had a valuation allowance of $1.6 billion related to capital loss 
carryforwards, and certain state and other deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized 
due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains. To the extent realization of the 
deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits 
during the period.
Given our current and possible future earnings, we believe that we may release the valuation allowance associated with 
certain state deferred tax assets in the near term, which would decrease our income tax expense for the period the 
release is recorded. The timing and amount of the valuation allowance release could vary based on our assessment of all 
available information.
As of January 26, 2025, we had U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $479 million, 
$332 million and $349 million, respectively. The federal and state carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal years 2026 
and 2027, respectively. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $349 million may be carried forward indefinitely. 
As of January 26, 2025, we had federal research tax credit carryforwards of $46 million, before the impact of uncertain 
tax positions, that will begin to expire in fiscal year 2026. We have state research tax credit carryforwards of $1.5 billion, 
before the impact of uncertain tax positions. $1.4 billion is attributable to the State of California and may be carried over 
indefinitely and $98 million is attributable to various other states and will begin to expire in fiscal year 2026. As of 
January 26, 2025, we had federal capital loss carryforwards of $1.3 billion that will begin to expire in fiscal year 2028.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our tax attributes remain subject to audit and may be adjusted for changes or modification in tax laws, other 
authoritative interpretations thereof, or other facts and circumstances. Utilization of tax attributes may also be subject 
to limitations due to ownership changes and other limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state 
and foreign tax provisions. If any such limitations apply, the tax attributes may expire or be denied before utilization.

Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of January 26, 2025 are $2 billion of tax benefits that would 
affect our effective tax rate if recognized.
We classify an unrecognized tax benefit as a current liability, or amount refundable, to the extent that we anticipate 
payment or receipt of cash for income taxes within one year. The amount is classified as a long-term liability, or reduction 
of long-term amount refundable, if we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes during a period beyond a 
year.
We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. We 
recognized net interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax expense line of our 
consolidated statements of income of $92 million, $42 million, and $33 million during fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, 
respectively. As of January 26, 2025 and January 28, 2024, we have accrued $251 million and $140 million, respectively, 
for the payment of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, which is not included as a component of 
our gross unrecognized tax benefits.
While we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be 
greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax-related matters to 
be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise 
resolved. As of January 26, 2025, we have not identified any positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total 
amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.
We are subject to taxation by taxing authorities both in the United States and other countries. As of January 26, 2025, 
the significant tax jurisdictions that may be subject to examination include the United States for fiscal years after 2021, 
as well as China, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom for fiscal years 2014 through 2024. 
As of January 26, 2025, the significant tax jurisdictions for which we are currently under examination include Germany, 
Hong Kong, India, Israel, and Taiwan for fiscal years 2014 through 2024, and the State of California for fiscal years 2020 
to 2022.
Note 14 - Shareholders’ Equity
Capital Return Program
On August 26, 2024, our Board of Directors approved an additional $50 billion to our share repurchase authorization, 
without expiration. In fiscal years 2025 and 2024, we repurchased 310 million and 210 million shares of our common 
stock for $34.0 billion and $9.7 billion, respectively. As of January 26, 2025, we were authorized, subject to certain 
specifications, to repurchase up to $38.7 billion of our common stock. Our share repurchase program aims to offset 
dilution from shares issued to employees while maintaining adequate liquidity to meet our operating requirements. We 
may pursue additional share repurchases as we weigh market factors and other investment opportunities.
From January 27, 2025 through February 21, 2025, we repurchased 29 million shares for $3.7 billion pursuant to a preestablished trading plan.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(Continued)

In fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, we paid cash dividends to our shareholders of $834 million, $395 million, and 
$398 million, respectively. The payment of future cash dividends is subject to our Board of Directors' continuing 
determination that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of our shareholders.
Note 15 - Employee Retirement Plans
We provide tax-qualified defined contribution plans to eligible employees in the U.S. and certain other countries. Our 
contribution expense for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 was $314 million, $255 million, and $227 million, respectively.
Note 16 - Segment Information
Our Chief Executive Officer is our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, and reviews financial information presented 
on an operating segment basis for purposes of making decisions and assessing financial performance. Our CODM 
assesses operating performance of each segment based on regularly provided segment revenue and segment operating 
income. Operating results by segment include costs or expenses directly attributable to each segment, and costs or 
expenses that are leveraged across our unified architecture and therefore allocated between our two segments. Our 
CODM reviews expenses on a consolidated basis, and expenses attributable to each segment are not regularly provided 
to our CODM.
The Compute & Networking segment includes our Data Center accelerated computing platforms and AI solutions and 
software; networking; automotive platforms and autonomous and electric vehicle solutions; Jetson for robotics and other 
embedded platforms; and DGX Cloud computing services.
The Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and 
related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise workstation graphics; 
vGPU software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; automotive platforms for infotainment systems; and 
Omniverse Enterprise software for building and operating industrial AI and digital twin applications.
The “All Other” category includes the expenses that are not allocated to either Compute & Networking or Graphics for 
purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The expenses include stock-based 
compensation expense, corporate infrastructure and support costs, acquisition-related and other costs, and other nonrecurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature.
Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. There are no 
intersegment transactions. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for our consolidated financial 
statements. The table below presents details of our reportable segments and the “All Other” category.

(1) Singapore represented 18% of fiscal year 2025 total revenue based upon customer billing location. Customers use 
Singapore to centralize invoicing while our products are almost always shipped elsewhere. Shipments to Singapore 
were less than 2% of fiscal year 2025 total revenue. 
Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 53%, 56%, and 69% of total revenue for 
fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The increase in revenue to the United States for fiscal years 2025 and 
2024 was primarily due to higher U.S.-based Compute & Networking segment demand.
We refer to customers who purchase products directly from NVIDIA as direct customers, such as AIBs, distributors, 
ODMs, OEMs, and system integrators. We have certain customers that may purchase products directly from NVIDIA and 
may use either internal resources or third-party system integrators to complete their build. We also have indirect 
customers, who purchase products through our direct customers; indirect customers include CSPs, consumer internet 
companies, enterprises, and public sector entities.
