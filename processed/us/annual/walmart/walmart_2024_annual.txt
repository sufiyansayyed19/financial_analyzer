ITEM 1.
BUSINESS
General

helping people around the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere – by providing the opportunity to shop in 
both retail stores and through eCommerce, and to access our other service offerings. Through innovation, we strive to 
continuously improve a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates our eCommerce and retail stores in an omnichannel offering that saves time for our customers. Each week, we serve approximately 255 million customers who visit more 
than 10,500 stores and numerous eCommerce websites in 19 countries.
Our strategy is to make every day easier for busy families, operate with discipline, sharpen our culture and become more digital, 
and make trust a competitive advantage. Making life easier for busy families includes our commitment to price leadership, 
which has been and will remain a cornerstone of our business, as well as increasing convenience to save our customers time. 
By leading on price, we earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and 
services at everyday low prices ("EDLP"). EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every 
day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity. Everyday low cost ("EDLC") is 
our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers.
Our operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Our fiscal year ends 
on January 31 for our United States ("U.S.") and Canadian operations. We consolidate all other operations generally using a 
one-month lag and on a calendar year basis. Our discussion is as of, and for the fiscal years ended, January 31, 2024 ("fiscal 
2024"), January 31, 2023 ("fiscal 2023") and January 31, 2022 ("fiscal 2022"). During fiscal 2024, we generated total revenues 
of $648.1 billion, which was comprised primarily of net sales of $642.6 billion.
We maintain our principal offices in Bentonville, Arkansas. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under 
the symbol "WMT."
The Development of Our Company
The businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store 
in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our 
founders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores, at which time we began to open discount stores. We 
completed our initial public offering in 1970. In 1983, we opened our first Sam's Club, and in 1988, we opened our first 
supercenter. In 1998, we opened our first Walmart Neighborhood Market. In 1991, we began our first international initiative 
when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico and, as of January 31, 2024, our Walmart International segment conducted 
business in 18 countries.
In 2000, we began our first eCommerce initiative by creating both walmart.com and samsclub.com. Since then, our 
eCommerce presence has continued to grow. In 2007, leveraging our physical stores, walmart.com launched its Site-to-Store 
service, enabling customers to make a purchase online and pick up merchandise in stores. To date, we now have over 8,000 
pickup and over 7,800 delivery locations globally. In recent years, we expanded our eCommerce and digital presence through 
acquisitions with our majority stakes in Flipkart and PhonePe in India. We continue to heavily invest in omni-channel and 
eCommerce innovation, which enables us to leverage technology, talent and expertise, and expand our assortment and service 
offerings.
We are enhancing our omni-channel capabilities through a combination of stores, eCommerce websites and service offerings, as 
well as our supply chain, combined with approximately 2.1 million associates as of January 31, 2024, to better serve our 
customers. Together, these elements produce a global retail ecosystem that we believe allows customers to view Walmart as 
their primary retail destination. In the U.S., our Walmart+ membership incorporates several service offerings which provide 
enhanced omni-channel shopping experiences and benefits for members. As we execute on our strategy globally, our business 
is expanding through offerings such as advertising, marketplace and fulfillment services, healthcare and financial services. 
These offerings represent mutually reinforcing pieces of our omni-channel model centered on our customers around the world 
who are increasingly seeking convenience.

Information About Our Segments
We are engaged in global operations of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce, located throughout the U.S., 
Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. We also previously operated in the United Kingdom and 
Japan prior to the sale of those operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Refer to Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial 
Statements for information on these divestitures. Our operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., 
Walmart International and Sam's Club, which are further described below. Each segment contributes to the Company's 
operating results differently. However, each has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales 
in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to the exit of certain 
markets and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Additional information on our operating segments and geographic 
information is contained in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Walmart U.S. Segment

Walmart U.S. is a mass merchandiser of consumer products, operating under the "Walmart" and "Walmart Neighborhood 
Market" brands, including walmart.com. Walmart U.S. had net sales of $441.8 billion for fiscal 2024, representing 69% of our 
fiscal 2024 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $420.6 billion and $393.2 billion for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
Of our three segments, Walmart U.S. has historically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales ("gross profit 
rate"). In addition, Walmart U.S. has historically contributed the greatest amount to the Company's net sales and operating 
income. 
Omni-channel. Walmart U.S. provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce, 
through services such as pickup and delivery, in-home delivery, ship-from-store and digital pharmacy fulfillment options. As 
of January 31, 2024, the vast majority of our stores have pickup locations and more than 4,300 locations offer same-day 
delivery. Our Walmart+ membership offering provides enhanced omni-channel shopping benefits including unlimited free 
shipping on eligible items with no order minimum, unlimited delivery from store, fuel discounts, mobile Scan & Go and access 
to additional member benefits. We define eCommerce sales as sales initiated by customers digitally and fulfilled by a number 
of methods including our dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers and leveraging our stores, as well as certain other business 
offerings that are part of our ecosystem, such as our Walmart Connect advertising business. The following table provides the

Merchandise. Walmart U.S. does business primarily in three strategic merchandise units, listed below:
Grocery consists of a full line of grocery items, including dry grocery, snacks, dairy, meat, produce, deli & bakery, 
frozen foods, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, as well as consumables such as health and beauty aids, pet 
supplies, household chemicals, paper goods and baby products;
General merchandise includes:
Entertainment (e.g., electronics, toys, seasonal merchandise, wireless, video games, movies, music and 
books);
Hardlines (e.g., automotive, hardware and paint, sporting goods, outdoor living and stationery);
Fashion (e.g., apparel for adults and children, as well as shoes, jewelry and accessories); and
Home (e.g., housewares and small appliances, bed & bath, furniture and home organization, home 
furnishings, home decor, fabrics and crafts).
Health and wellness includes pharmacy, over-the-counter drugs and other medical products, optical services and other 
clinical services.
Other categories in the Walmart U.S. business include fuel and various service offerings such as in-house advertising via 
Walmart Connect, supply chain and fulfillment capabilities to online marketplace sellers via Walmart Fulfillment Services, 
initiatives such as business-to-business last mile delivery services via Walmart GoLocal, and a suite of data products for 
merchants and suppliers via Walmart Luminate. Additional service offerings include financial services and related products 
(including through our digital channels, stores and our fintech venture, ONE), such as money orders, prepaid access, money 
transfers, check cashing, bill payment and certain types of installment lending. 
Brand name merchandise represents a significant portion of the merchandise sold in Walmart U.S. We also market lines of 
merchandise under our private brands, including brands such as: "Allswell," "Athletic Works," "Equate," "Free Assembly," 

"Freshness Guaranteed," "George," "Great Value," "Holiday Time," "Hyper Tough," "Mainstays," "Marketside," "No 
Boundaries," "onn.," "Ozark Trail," "Parent's Choice," "Sam's Choice," "Scoop," "Spring Valley," "Time and Tru," "Way to 
Celebrate" and "Wonder Nation." The Company also markets lines of merchandise under licensed brands, some of which 
include: "Avia," "Better Homes & Gardens," "Love & Sports," "Sofia Jeans by Sofia Vergara," and "The Pioneer Woman."
Periodically, revisions are made to the categorization of the components comprising our strategic merchandise units. When 
revisions are made, the previous periods' presentation is adjusted to maintain comparability.
Operations. Walmart U.S. is available to customers through supercenters, discount stores and neighborhood markets, as well 
as online or through the mobile application 24 hours a day. Consistent with its strategy, Walmart U.S. continues to develop 
technology tools and services to better serve customers and help stores operate more efficiently, such as pickup and delivery, 
Walmart+, ship-from-store and other initiatives which provide convenient and seamless omni-channel shopping experiences. 
Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Walmart U.S.'s business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national 
and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, its highest sales volume has occurred in the fiscal 
quarter ending January 31. 
Competition. Walmart U.S. competes with brick and mortar, eCommerce and omni-channel retailers operating discount, 
department, retail and wholesale grocers, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and 
supercenter-type stores, social commerce platforms, as well as companies that offer services in digital advertising, fulfillment 
and delivery services, health and wellness and financial services. Each of these landscapes is highly competitive and rapidly 
evolving, and new business models and the entry of new, well-funded competitors continue to intensify this competition. Some 
of our competitors have longer histories in these lines of business, more customers and greater brand recognition. They may be 
able to obtain more favorable terms from suppliers and business partners and to devote greater resources to the development of 
these businesses. In addition, for eCommerce and other internet-based businesses, newer or smaller businesses may be better 
able to innovate and compete with us.
Our ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely 
determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which 
we sell our merchandise, merchandise and selection availability, services offered to customers, the quality of the products and 
services we offer, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, 
the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of 
merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel integration of our physical and digital 
operations. We employ many strategies and programs designed to meet competitive pressures within our industry. These 
strategies include the following:
EDLP: our pricing philosophy under which we price items at everyday low prices so our customers trust that our 
prices will not change under frequent promotional activity;
EDLC: everyday low cost is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our 
customers;
Omni-channel offerings such as pickup and delivery and our Walmart+ membership offering, all of which enhance 
convenience and seek to serve customers in the ways they want to be served; and 
Expanding our ecosystem and the products and services we offer in areas such as digital advertising, fulfillment 
services, health and wellness, and financial services to provide our customers a broader set of offerings to meet 
expanding needs.
Distribution. We continue to invest in supply chain automation and utilize a total of 162 distribution facilities which are 
located strategically throughout the U.S. For fiscal 2024, the majority of Walmart U.S.'s purchases of store merchandise were 
shipped through these facilities, while most of the remaining store merchandise we purchased was shipped directly from 
suppliers. General merchandise and dry grocery merchandise is transported primarily through the segment's private truck fleet; 
however, we contract with common carriers to transport the majority of our perishable grocery merchandise. We ship 
merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations including 
from our 30 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers, as well as leveraging our ability to ship or deliver directly from more 
than 4,300 stores, some of which include market fulfillment centers, which are positioned inside or attached to our stores to fill 
online orders more efficiently.

Walmart International Segment
Walmart International is our second largest segment and operates in 18 countries outside of the U.S. Walmart International 
operates through our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Canada, Chile, China, and Africa (which includes Botswana, Lesotho, 
Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Eswatini, and Zambia), and our majority-owned subsidiaries in India, as well as 
Mexico and Central America (which includes Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua). Walmart 
International previously operated in the United Kingdom and Japan prior to the sale of those operations in the first quarter of 
fiscal 2022. Refer to Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent divestitures.

consist of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs) and 
cash & carry, as well as eCommerce through websites and mobile applications, including walmart.com.mx, walmart.ca, 
flipkart.com, PhonePe and other sites. Walmart International had net sales of $114.6 billion for fiscal 2024, representing 18% 
of our fiscal 2024 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $101.0 billion for both fiscal 2023 and 2022. The gross profit rate 
is slightly lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its format and channel mix. 
Walmart International's strategy is to create strong local businesses powered by Walmart, which means being locally relevant 
and customer-focused in each of the markets it operates. We are being deliberate about where and how we choose to operate 
and continue to re-shape the portfolio to best enable long-term, sustainable and profitable growth. As such, we have taken 
certain strategic actions to strengthen our Walmart International portfolio for the long-term, which include the following 
highlights over the last three years: 
Divested of Asda Group Limited ("Asda"), our retail operations in the U.K., in February 2021. 
Divested of a majority stake in Seiyu, our retail operations in Japan, in March 2021.
Bought out the noncontrolling interest shareholders of our Massmart subsidiary in November 2022 and exited 
operations in certain countries in Africa.
Increased our ownership in PhonePe, our digital payments platform in India, as part of the separation from Flipkart in 
December 2022.
Omni-channel. Walmart International provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and 
eCommerce, such as through pickup and delivery services in most of our markets and our marketplaces such as Flipkart in 
India. Our financial services offerings continue to grow with our digital payment platform at PhonePe in India. We continue to 
expand our marketplace offerings, which also unlock fulfillment and advertising services.
Generally, retail units' selling areas range in size from 1,400 square feet to 186,000 square feet. Our wholesale stores' selling 
areas generally range in size from 25,000 square feet to 158,000 square feet. As of January 31, 2024, Walmart International 
had over 2,800 pickup and over 2,900 delivery locations.
Merchandise. The merchandising strategy for Walmart International is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of 
the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we 
have both leveraged U.S. private brands and developed market specific private brands to serve our customers with high quality, 
low priced items. Along with the private brands we market globally, such as "Equate," "George," "Great Value," "Holiday 
Time," "Mainstays," "Marketside" and "Parent's Choice," our international markets have developed market specific brands 
including "Aurrera" and "Lider." In addition, we have developed and continue to grow our relationships with regional and local 
suppliers in each market to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at low prices.
Consistent with its strategy, Walmart International continues to build mutually reinforcing businesses in areas such as 
advertising, marketplace and fulfillment services, healthcare and financial services. Our businesses in Mexico and Canada, for 
example, offer prepaid cards and money transfers, and our PhonePe business in India continues to grow, providing a platform 
that offers mobile and bill payment, person-to-person (P2P) payment, investment and insurance solutions, financial services and 
advertising. In Mexico, we also offer a value-based internet and telephone service allowing customers to enjoy digital 
connectivity. Combined, these offerings did not represent a significant portion of annual segment revenues.
Operations. The hours of operation for operating units in Walmart International vary by country and by individual markets 
within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation. Customers can also access online 
and mobile applications 24 hours a day. Consistent with its strategy, Walmart International continues to develop technology 
tools and services to better serve customers and help its various formats operate more efficiently, as well as to provide 
convenient and seamless omni-channel shopping experiences. 
Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Walmart International's business is seasonal to a certain extent. Historically, its highest sales 
volume has occurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different 
national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns.

Competition. Walmart International competes with brick and mortar, eCommerce and omni-channel retailers who operate 
department, drug, discount, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, wholesale 
clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, cash & carry operations and convenience stores, and direct to 
consumer offerings, as well as companies that offer services in digital advertising, fulfillment services, health and wellness and 
financial services. Our ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel 
experience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We believe price leadership is a critical part 
of our business model and we continue to progress our markets towards an EDLP approach. Additionally, our ability to operate 
food departments effectively has a significant impact on our competitive position in many of the markets where we operate. 
Each of these landscapes is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and new business models and the entry of new or wellfunded competitors continue to intensify this competition. Some of our competitors have longer histories in these lines of 
business, more customers and greater brand recognition and therefore they may be able to obtain more favorable terms from 
suppliers and business partners and to devote greater resources to the development of these businesses. In addition, for 
eCommerce and other internet-based businesses, newer or smaller businesses may be better able to innovate and compete with 
us.
Distribution. We utilize a total of 176 distribution facilities located in Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Mexico 
and Africa. Through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the 
Walmart International segment. During fiscal 2024, the majority of Walmart International's purchases passed through these 
distribution facilities. Suppliers ship the remainder of Walmart International's purchases directly to our stores in the various 
markets in which we operate. Across the segment, we have efficient networks connecting physical stores and distribution and 
fulfillment centers, which facilitate the movement of goods to where our customers live. We ship merchandise purchased by 
customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations, such as in India where we utilize a 
combination of more than 3,500 eCommerce fulfillment centers, sort centers and last-mile delivery facilities, as well as our 
physical retail stores.
Sam's Club Segment
Sam's Club operates in 44 states in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico. Sam's Club is a membership-only warehouse club that also 
operates samsclub.com. Sam's Club had net sales of $86.2 billion for fiscal 2024, representing 13% of our consolidated fiscal 
2024 net sales, and had net sales of $84.3 billion and $73.6 billion for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. As a membershiponly warehouse club, membership income is a significant component of the segment's operating income. Sam's Club operates 
with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments.
Membership. The following two options are available to members:
Plus Membership
Club Membership
Annual Membership Fee
$110
$50
Number of Add-on Memberships ($45 each)
Up to 16
Up to 8
All memberships include a spouse/household card at no additional cost. Plus Members are also eligible for free curbside pickup 
and free shipping on the majority of merchandise, with no minimum order size, and receive discounts on prescriptions and 
glasses. Beginning in fiscal 2023, Sam's Club launched a single loyalty rewards currency called Sam's Cash which merges and 
replaces existing Cash Rewards for Plus members and Cash Back for Sam's Club Mastercard holders. Members may redeem 
Sam's Cash on purchases in the club and online, to pay for membership fees or for cash in clubs. Sam's Cash does not expire 
and is available for monthly redemption. 
Omni-channel. Sam's Club provides an omni-channel experience to members, integrating warehouse clubs and eCommerce 
through such services as Curbside Pickup, mobile Scan & Go, ship-from-club, and delivery-from-club. Members have access 
to a broad assortment of merchandise and services, including those not found in our clubs, online at samsclub.com and through 
our mobile commerce applications. The warehouse facility sizes generally range between 32,000 and 168,000 square feet, with 
an average size of approximately 134,000 square feet. 
Merchandise. Sam's Club offers merchandise in the following five merchandise categories:
Grocery and consumables includes dairy, meat, bakery, deli, produce, dry, chilled or frozen packaged foods, alcoholic 
and nonalcoholic beverages, floral, snack foods, candy, other grocery items, health and beauty aids, paper goods, 
laundry and home care, baby care, pet supplies and other consumable items;
Fuel, tobacco and other categories;
Home and apparel includes home improvement, outdoor living, gardening, furniture, apparel, jewelry, tools and power 
equipment, housewares, toys, seasonal items, mattresses and tire and battery centers;
Health and wellness includes pharmacy, optical and hearing services and over-the-counter drugs; and

Technology, office and entertainment includes consumer electronics and accessories, software, video games, office 
supplies, appliances and third-party gift cards.
Within the categories above, the Member's Mark private label brand continues to expand its assortment and deliver member 
value.
Operations. Sam's Club is available to members through warehouse club locations, as well as online or through the mobile 
application 24 hours a day. Club locations offer Plus Members the ability to shop before regular operating hours. Consistent 
with its strategy, Sam's Club continues to develop technology tools to drive a great member experience. Curbside Pickup is 
available at clubs to help provide fast, easy and contact-free shopping for members. Sam's Club also offers Scan & Go, a 
mobile checkout and payment solution, which allows members to bypass the checkout line.
Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Sam's Club's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and 
religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, its highest sales volume has occurred in the fiscal quarter 
ending January 31. 
Competition. Sam's Club competes with other membership-only warehouse clubs, the largest of which is Costco, as well as 
with discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations as well 
as omni-channel and eCommerce retailers and catalog businesses. At Sam's Club, we provide value at members-only prices, a 
quality merchandise assortment, and bulk sizing to serve both our Plus and Club members. Our eCommerce website and 
mobile commerce applications have increasingly become important factors in our ability to compete.
Distribution. We utilize 30 dedicated distribution facilities located strategically throughout the U.S., as well as some of the 
Walmart U.S. segment's distribution facilities which service the Sam's Club segment for certain items. During fiscal 2024, the 
majority of Sam's Club's non-fuel club purchases were shipped from these facilities, while the remainder of our purchases were 
shipped directly to Sam's Club locations by suppliers. Sam's Club ships merchandise purchased on samsclub.com and through 
its mobile commerce applications by a number of methods including shipments made directly from clubs, 15 dedicated 
eCommerce fulfillment centers and other distribution centers. 
Sam's Club uses a combination of our private truck fleet, as well as common carriers, to transport perishable and non-perishable 
merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs.
Intellectual Property
We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary 
technologies and similar intellectual property as important to our success, and with respect to our associates, customers and 
others, we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent laws, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements 
to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international 
domain names, trademarks, service marks and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent 
applications covering certain of our proprietary technology. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the 
future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties.
Suppliers and Supply Chain
As a retailer and warehouse club operator, we utilize a global supply chain that includes both U.S. and international suppliers 
from whom we purchase the merchandise that we sell in our stores, clubs and online. In many instances, we purchase 
merchandise from producers located near the stores and clubs in which such merchandise will be sold, particularly products in 
the "fresh" category. Consistent with applicable laws, we offer our suppliers the opportunity to efficiently sell significant 
quantities of their products to us. These relationships enable us to obtain pricing that reflects the volume, certainty and costeffectiveness these arrangements provide to such suppliers, which in turn enables us to provide low prices to our customers. 
Our suppliers are subject to standards of conduct, including requirements that they comply with local labor laws, local worker 
safety laws and other applicable laws. Our ability to acquire from our suppliers the assortment and volume of products we wish 
to offer to our customers, to receive those products within the required time through our supply chain and to distribute those 
products to our stores and clubs, determines, along with other supply chain logistics matters (such as containers or port access 
for example), in part, our in-stock levels in our stores and clubs and the attractiveness of our merchandise assortment we offer 
to our customers and members.
Government Regulation
As a company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions in which 
we operate and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions. For additional 
information, see the risk factors herein in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" under the sub-caption "Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, 
Reputational and Other Risks."

Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") Priorities
Our ESG strategy is centered on the concept of creating shared value: we believe we maximize long-term value and create 
competitive advantage for the Company by serving our stakeholders, including our customers, associates, shareholders, 
suppliers, business partners and communities. We believe that addressing such societal needs builds the value of our business, 
including by enhancing customer and associate trust, creating new business opportunities, managing cost and risk, building 
capabilities for future advantage and strengthening the underlying systems on which Walmart and our stakeholders rely. 
We prioritize the ESG issues that offer the greatest potential for Walmart to create shared value: issues that rank high in 
relevance to our business and stakeholders and which Walmart is positioned to make a positive impact. Our current ESG 
priorities are categorized into four broad themes: opportunity, sustainability, community and ethics and integrity.
Opportunity. Retail can be a powerful engine for inclusive economic opportunity. We aim to advance belonging, 
diversity, equity and inclusion, and create opportunity for Walmart associates (as further described in the Human 
Capital Management section below), our suppliers and workers in supply chains, and the communities in which we 
operate. Doing so helps us fulfill our customer mission, strengthens our business and helps people build a better life 
for themselves and their families.
Sustainability. Walmart's sustainability efforts focus on our ability to create and preserve long-term value for both 
people and planet. With respect to people, our sustainability efforts include sourcing responsibly, helping prevent 
forced labor, empowering women, creating inclusive economic opportunity and selling safer, healthier products. With 
respect to the planet, our efforts aim to enhance the sustainability of product supply chains by reducing emissions, 
protecting and restoring nature and reducing waste. To help address the effects of climate change, Walmart has set 
science-based targets for emissions reduction, including our goal to achieve zero emissions in our operations by 2040
—without offsets—and to reduce, avoid or sequester one billion metric tons of emissions in our value chain by 2030 
under our Project Gigaton initiative. 
Community. Walmart aims to serve and strengthen communities by operating our business in a way that meets the 
needs of our customer and community stakeholder groups, including by providing safer, healthier and more affordable 
food and other products, disaster support, associate volunteerism, local grant programs and community cohesion 
initiatives.
Ethics and Integrity. At every level of our Company, we work to create a culture that inspires trust among our 
associates, with our customers and in the communities we serve. 
We periodically publish information on our ESG priorities, strategies and progress on our corporate website and may update 
those disclosures from time to time. Nothing on our website, including our ESG reporting, documents or sections thereof, shall 
be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or incorporated by reference into any of our other 
filings with the SEC.
Human Capital Management
Our associates – powered by technology – play a critical role in delivering on our purpose to help people save money and live 
better. Our business is focused on serving people and this is delivered by our approximately 2.1 million associates around the 
world with approximately 1.6 million associates in the U.S. and approximately 0.5 million associates internationally. In the 
U.S., approximately 92% of our associates are hourly and approximately 69% of our associates are full-time. 
We believe our people make the difference, and we are focused on investing in the growth and well-being of our associates, 
investing in digital experiences to improve their quality of work and creating a culture of belonging. An important part of our 
focus is to provide opportunities for associates to grow and learn. For some, we are a foundational entry point to develop 
critical skills that are relevant for a variety of careers. We are focused on developing, rewarding and retaining associates in an 
ever-changing environment. Our people ultimately make Walmart a better place to work and a better place to shop. Our 
workforce strategy includes the following strategic priorities: belonging, well-being, growth and digital.
Belonging - Focus on creating a workplace where all associates feel seen, supported and connected through a culture of 
belonging. We publish our diversity representation twice yearly and hold ourselves accountable to providing recurring 
belonging, diversity, equity and inclusion updates to senior leadership – including our President and CEO – and members of the 
Board of Directors. Of the approximately 2.1 million associates employed worldwide, 52% identify as women. In the U.S., 
51% of the approximately 1.6 million associates identify as people of color.
Our Belonging programs aim to create equitable opportunities for everyone, regardless of background, so that every eligible 
and qualified individual can thrive and perform. We regularly review our processes around fair-pay practices and are committed 
to creating a performance culture where associates are rewarded based on meaningful factors such as qualifications, experience, 
performance and the work they do. 

To build a company where associates feel seen, supported and connected, we gather and respond to associate feedback in a 
variety of ways, including in-person dialogue; real-time digital insights such as pulse surveys; formal surveys like our associate 
engagement survey; and always-on confidential channels, including our Open Door process and ethics channels. 
Well-being - Prioritize the emotional, physical and financial well-being of associates. We invest in our associates by offering 
competitive wages, as well as a broad range of benefits to meet the diverse needs of our global associate population and their 
eligible dependents. In the U.S., this includes company-paid benefits such as 401(k) match, family building support, maternity 
leave, fertility benefits, a paid parental leave program to all full-time associates, paid time off, Associate Stock Purchase Plan 
match, life insurance, behavioral and mental health services, a Walmart discount card or Sam's Club membership and 
predictable scheduling that helps associates plan for life outside of work and know what to expect in their paychecks. 
Additional information about how we invest in our associates' well-being, including wage structure and pay, can be found in 
our Human Capital brief in our most recent ESG reporting, which is available on our corporate website. Nothing on our 
website, including our ESG reporting documents, or sections thereof, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this 
Annual Report on Form 10-K or incorporated by reference into any of our other filings with the SEC. Certain information 
relating to retirement-related benefits we provide to our associates is included in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial 
Statements. 
Growth - Provide ongoing growth, development and learning opportunities for associates and continue to attract talent with 
new skills. We are invested in the growth of our associates – in support of our business and their success – by offering good 
jobs that lead to great careers and better lives.
Approximately 75% of our U.S. salaried store, club and supply chain management started their careers in hourly positions. Our 
focus on providing a path of opportunity for our associates through robust training, competitive wages and benefits and career 
advancement creates a strong associate value proposition and strengthens our workforce. In the U.S., we seek to enable these 
pathways through programs like Walmart Academy and Live Better U (LBU). Walmart Academy offers training for on-the-job 
retail skills, leadership and well-being, serving our associates through a combination of digital and in-person offerings. 
Additionally, our LBU program provides access to educational opportunities for our part-time and full-time frontline eligible 
associates in the U.S. through high school diplomas, short-form certificates and credentials or college degrees.
Digital - Drive a digital transformation that improves the associate experience and powers the business. To deliver a seamless 
customer and associate experience, we continue to invest in consumer-grade digital tools designed to improve associate 
productivity and efficiency, engagement and performance, allowing associates to spend more time generating new ideas, 
developing strategy and building relationships. This capability has been expanded to certain international markets. 
Technology is also used to improve associate experience, including an app developed to capture real-time associate feedback. 
Walmart also supports associates on the U.S. Medical Plan with free virtual visits for medical doctor urgent care and mental 
health care with psychiatrists and psychologists.

ITEM 1A.
RISK FACTORS
The risks described below could, in ways we may or may not be able to accurately predict, materially and adversely affect our 
business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity. Our business operations could also be affected by additional 
factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally. The following risk factors do not identify all risks that we 
may face.
Strategic Risks
Failure to successfully execute our omni-channel strategy and the cost of our investments in eCommerce and technology 
may materially adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance.
The retail business continues to rapidly evolve and consumers increasingly embrace digital shopping. As a result, the portion of 
total consumer expenditures with retailers and wholesale clubs occurring through digital platforms is increasing and the pace of 
this increase could continue to accelerate. 
Our strategy, which includes investments in eCommerce, technology, including the use of artificial intelligence technology, 
talent, supply chain automation, acquisitions, joint ventures, store remodels and other customer initiatives may not adequately 
or effectively allow us to continue to grow our eCommerce business, increase comparable sales, maintain or grow our overall 
market position or otherwise offset the impact on the growth of our business of a moderated pace of new store and club 
openings and sustain the current pace of remodels. The success of this strategy will depend in large measure on our ability to 
continue building and delivering a seamless omni-channel shopping experience and interconnected ecosystem for our customers 
that deepens and maintains our relationships with our customers across our various businesses and partnerships and reinforces 
our overall enterprise strategy. The success of this strategy is further subject to the related risks discussed in this Item 1A. With 
the interconnected components of this enterprise strategy and an increasing allocation of capital expenditures focused on these 
initiatives, changes in customer or member perceptions about our reputation or our failure to successfully execute on individual 
components of this strategy may adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance, which could also 
result in impairment charges to intangible assets or other long-lived assets. In addition, a greater concentration of eCommerce 
sales, including increasing online grocery sales, could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs, 
which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-store or cross-club sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and 
could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect our financial performance.
Furthermore, the cost of certain investments in eCommerce, technology, talent and automation, including any operating losses 
incurred for those initiatives, will adversely impact our financial performance in the short-term and failure to realize the benefits 
of these investments may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term.
If we do not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, it could negatively affect our 
relationship with our customers, demand for the products and services we sell, our market share and the growth of our 
business.
It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their 
shopping patterns, tastes and preferences. The success of our business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer 
demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products and services and the competitive 
environment. Our business is dependent on our ability to make critical decisions and predictions with respect to merchandise 
categories that quickly respond to changing consumer spending patterns, tastes and preferences, any incorrect calculations by us 
may result in lower sales, spoilage and inventory markdowns, which could adversely impact our results of operations. Our 
ability to predict and adapt to changing tastes and preferences depends on many factors, including obtaining accurate and 

relevant data on customer preferences, emphasizing relevant merchandise categories, effectively managing our inventory levels, 
and implementing competitive and effective pricing and promotion strategies. Price transparency, assortment of products, 
customer experience, convenience, ease and the speed and cost of shipping are of primary importance to customers and 
continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the 
choices available to consumers for purchasing products. We must continue to preserve our reputation, which is impacted based 
on public perceptions. It may be difficult to address negative publicity across media channels, regardless of whether it is 
accurate. Negative incidents involving us, our workforce (including the loss of merchandise as a result of shrink or theft) or 
others with whom we do business could quickly erode trust and confidence in our business and could result in consumer 
boycotts, workforce unrest and government investigations. Negative reputational incidents or negative perceptions of us could 
adversely impact our business and results of operations, including through lower sales, the termination of business relationships 
and associate retention and recruiting efforts. Moreover, failure to adequately predict customer demand and consumer spending 
patterns or otherwise optimize and operate our distribution and fulfillment centers could result in excess or insufficient 
inventory, service interruptions and increased costs, any of which could significantly harm our business. As we continue to add 
new fulfillment centers, our fulfillment and technology networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes 
more challenging. There can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively.
We face strong competition from other retailers, wholesale club operators, omni-channel retailers and other businesses 
which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
Each of our segments competes for customers, employees, digital prominence, products and services and in other important 
aspects of its business with many other local, regional, national and global physical, eCommerce and omni-channel retailers, 
social commerce platforms, wholesale club operators and retail intermediaries, as well as companies that offer services in 
digital advertising, fulfillment and delivery services, health and wellness and financial services. The omni-channel retail 
landscape is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and the entry of new, well-funded competitors may increase competitive 
pressures. In addition, for eCommerce and other internet-based businesses, newer or smaller businesses may be better able to 
innovate and compete with us.
We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection and availability, 
services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping 
experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms, cost and speed of and options for delivery to 
customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel integration of our physical and 
digital operations.
A failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail and other markets in which we operate, omnichannel innovations and omni-channel ecosystems developed by our competitors or delays or failure in execution of our 
strategy could materially adversely affect our financial performance. See "Item 1. Business" above for additional discussion of 
the competitive situation of each of our reportable segments.
Certain segments of the retail industry are undergoing consolidation or substantially reducing operations, whether due to 
bankruptcy, consolidation or other factors. Such consolidation, or other business combinations or alliances, competitive omnichannel ecosystems or reductions in operations may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved 
access to merchandise, greater market penetration and other improvements in their competitive positions. Such business 
combinations or alliances could allow these companies to provide a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices, 
which could adversely affect our financial performance.
General or macro-economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely affect our financial 
performance.
General economic conditions and other economic factors, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely 
affect our financial performance. Higher interest rates, higher prices of petroleum products, including crude oil, natural gas, 
gasoline and diesel fuel, higher costs for electricity and other energy, weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflation, 
increased costs of essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels of unemployment, decreases in consumer 
disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, changes in consumer spending and shopping 
patterns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes or other changes in tax laws, changes 
in healthcare laws, other regulatory changes, the imposition of tariffs or other measures that create barriers to or increase the 
costs associated with international trade, overall economic slowdown or recession and other economic factors in the U.S., or in 
any of the other markets in which we operate, could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell in 
the U.S. or such other markets, change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown 
in discretionary purchases of goods, adversely affect our net sales, growth rates, operating income and result in slower 
inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory, or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating 
results and could result in impairment charges to intangible assets, goodwill or other long-lived assets.
In addition, the economic factors listed above, any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation, 
labor, insurance or healthcare costs or commodity prices, including energy prices, and other economic factors in the U.S. and 

other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses 
and otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results.
The economic factors that affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers, which can result in an 
increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, in certain suppliers not producing 
goods in the volume typically available to us for sale, or adversely impact product margins due to higher labor and material 
costs of our suppliers that we are unable, or choose not, to pass on to our customers.
The performance of strategic alliances and other business relationships to support the expansion of our business could 
materially adversely affect our financial performance.
We may enter into strategic alliances and other business relationships in the countries in which we have existing operations or 
in other markets to expand our business. These arrangements (such as ONE, our fintech venture, and our healthcare initiative 
with UnitedHealth Group) may not generate the level of sales or profitability we anticipate when entering into the arrangement 
or may otherwise adversely impact our business and competitive position relative to the results we could have achieved in the 
absence of such alliance. In addition, any investment we make in connection with a strategic alliance, business relationship or 
in certain of our divested markets, could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
Operational Risks
Global or regional health pandemics or epidemics, such as COVID-19, could negatively impact our business, financial 
position and results of operations. 
The emergence, severity, magnitude and duration of global or regional pandemics, epidemics or other health crises are 
uncertain and difficult to predict. A pandemic, such as COVID-19, or other epidemic or contagious disease outbreak could 
impact our business operations, demand for our products and services, in-stock positions, costs of doing business, access to 
inventory, supply chain operations, the extent and duration of measures to try to contain the spread of a virus or other disease 
(such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, limitations on large gatherings, business and 
government shutdowns and other restrictions on retailers), our ability to predict future performance, exposure to litigation and 
our financial performance, among other things. In the event of any global or regional health crisis, customer demand for certain 
products may fluctuate, customer behaviors may change and consumer disposable income could be negatively impacted, which 
may challenge our ability to anticipate and/or adjust inventory levels to meet that demand. Other factors and uncertainties may 
include, but are not limited to: the severity and duration of pandemics, epidemics or other health crises, including disease 
outbreaks in areas in which we and our suppliers operate; increased operational costs; evolving macroeconomic factors, 
including general economic uncertainty, unemployment rates and recessionary pressures; unknown consequences on our 
business performance and initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time, capital and other resources to a 
pandemic or other health crisis response; the effectiveness and extent of administration of vaccinations and medical treatments; 
the pace of recovery when any such pandemic or other health crisis subsides; and the long-term impact of a pandemic or other 
health crisis on our business, including consumer behaviors. These risks and their impacts are difficult to predict and could 
otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and our financial performance.
To the extent that a future pandemic or epidemic occurs, such events may also heighten other risks described in this section, 
including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and expectations, competition, our reputation, implementation 
of strategic initiatives, cybersecurity threats, payment-related risks, technology systems disruption, supply chain disruptions, 
labor availability and cost, litigation and regulatory requirements.
Natural disasters, climate change, geopolitical events, catastrophic and other events could materially adversely affect 
our financial performance.
The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, 
cyclones, typhoons; weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of 
climate change or otherwise; geopolitical tensions or events; and catastrophic and other events, such as war, civil unrest 
(including theft, looting or vandalism), terrorist attacks or other acts of violence, including active shooter situations (such as 
those that have occurred in our U.S. stores), or the loss of merchandise as a result of shrink or theft in countries in which we 
operate, in which our suppliers are located or regions goods are transported from or through, or in other areas of the world (such 
as in Ukraine and Israel where wars currently exist, and armed hostilities in the Red Sea and surrounding areas through which 
ocean carrier vessels travel to the Suez Canal) could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. 
Such events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or 
more stores, clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers, limitations on store or club operating hours, the lack of an adequate 
work force in a market, the inability of customers and associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs affected 
by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution and fulfillment centers are 
located, the unavailability of our digital platforms to our customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers (including 
the frequency of visits by consumers to physical retail locations, whether as a result of limitations on large gatherings, travel 
and movement limitations or otherwise), such as Hurricane Otis that impacted our stores and operations around Acapulco, 

Mexico in fiscal 2024, although not material to our consolidated financial performance. Moreover, these disasters and events 
can negatively impact consumers' disposable income, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from 
some suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our 
distribution and fulfillment centers or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of 
products in our stores, increases in the costs of procuring products as a result of either reduced availability or economic 
sanctions, increased transportation costs (whether due to fuel prices, fuel supply or otherwise), the disruption (whether directly 
or indirectly) of critical infrastructure systems, banking systems, utility services or energy availability to our stores, clubs and 
our facilities and the disruption in our communications with our stores, clubs and our other facilities.
Furthermore, the long-term impacts of climate change, whether involving physical risks (such as extreme weather conditions, 
drought or rising sea levels) or transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes) are expected to be widespread and 
unpredictable. Certain impacts of physical risk may include: temperature changes that increase the heating and cooling costs at 
stores, clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers; extreme weather patterns that affect the production or sourcing of certain 
commodities; flooding and extreme storms that damage or destroy our buildings and inventory; and heat and extreme weather 
events that cause long-term disruption or threats to the habitability of the communities in which we operate. Relative to 
transition risk, certain impacts may include: changes in energy and commodity prices driven by climate-related weather events; 
prolonged climate-related events affecting macroeconomic conditions with related effects on consumer spending and 
confidence; stakeholder perception of our engagement in climate-related policies; and new regulatory requirements resulting in 
higher compliance risk and operational costs.
We bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to, or destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution or 
fulfillment centers; theft, loss or spoilage of inventory; and business interruption caused by such events. These events and their 
impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and could materially adversely affect our financial 
performance. Moreover, our operations in the U.S. comprise a significant portion of our financial and operational performance. 
Therefore, any of the above matters that uniquely impact or are specifically concentrated in the U.S. could materially adversely 
affect our financial and operational performance.
Risks associated with our suppliers could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the 
products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. We expect our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, 
including labor, safety, anti-corruption and environmental laws, and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of 
conduct. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficient 
manner and in the large volumes we may demand, is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and 
goods sourced outside the U.S.
Political and economic instability, as well as other impactful events and circumstances (such as pandemic recovery related 
challenges, including supply chain disruption and production, labor shortages and increases in labor costs) in the countries in 
which our suppliers and their manufacturers are located or regions goods are transported from or through, the financial 
instability of suppliers, suppliers not having the financial ability or capacity to fulfill their indemnification obligations to us if 
called upon, thereby exposing us to the full cost of risks and claims, suppliers' failure to meet our terms and conditions or our 
supplier standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their 
manufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption or delay in the 
transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs and other facilities, including as a result 
of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the markets in which we 
operate, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the 
suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control.
In addition, U.S. and international trade policies, tariffs and other restrictions on the exportation and importation of goods, trade 
sanctions imposed between certain countries and entities, the limitation on the exportation or importation of certain types of 
goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our 
control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our operations and 
financial performance.
If the quality or safety of products we sell in stores or online fails to meet our customers' expectations or regulatory 
standards, we could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries caused by a product we sell or otherwise experience a 
material impact to our brand, reputation and financial performance.
Our customers count on us to provide them with quality products at an affordable price. Occasionally, the quality of products 
that we source from our suppliers fails to meet customer expectations. In many cases, these products are subject to regulatory 
action or recall. For general merchandise, this could be because the product fails to meet safety standards. For food products, it 
could be because the product is a source of foodborne illness. For health and wellness products, it could be because the product 
does not produce the expected result for the customer or harms the customer. Any of these factors could cause customers to 
avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to choose to buy products from a different retailer, even if the quality issue is 

outside of our control. Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish. When a 
product we sell does not meet quality or safety standards, there is an increased risk of liability for harm the product may cause 
our customers. While we rely on our suppliers to meet our safety and quality expectations, and to indemnify us if their products 
do not, certain suppliers may not have the financial capacity or ability to fulfill their indemnification obligations. In that case, 
we are exposed to the full cost of liability claims. Any issue regarding the quality or safety of products we sell, regardless of 
the cause, could adversely affect our brand, reputation and financial performance.
If the quality or safety of products offered for sale on our third-party marketplace fails to meet our customers' 
expectations or regulatory standards, we could be held directly liable, lose customers, become subject to regulatory 
enforcement or otherwise experience reputational harm.
Some of the products customers buy from our website are sold by third parties, which we refer to as marketplace transactions. 
While that transaction ultimately occurs between the third-party seller and the customer, some regulators and courts have taken 
a view that the retailer is responsible for marketplace transactions that occur on a retailer's digital platform. Unsettled law on 
whether a retailer is responsible for intellectual property or product liability claims related to marketplace transactions creates 
additional risk. Any unfavorable changes or legal interpretations could further expose us to liability. In addition, poor quality or 
safety of third-party products offered for sale on our platforms could erode customer trust, leading to loss of sales, reduction in 
transactions and deterioration of our competitive position. In addition, we may face reputational, financial and other risks, 
including liability, for third-party products offered for sale on our platform that are controversial, counterfeit, pirated or stolen 
or that infringe the intellectual property rights of others. We may not be able to collect sufficient damages for these types of 
breaches from third-party sellers. Furthermore, a regulator may view us as having responsibility for regulatory compliance of 
the third-party products offered for sale on our platform. Although we have marketplace compliance controls in place and 
impose contractual terms on sellers to prohibit sales of non-compliant products, we may not be able prevent sellers from 
offering prohibited items for sale, enforce such terms, or fully protect against regulatory risk. Any of these events could have a 
material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our eCommerce growth and 
enterprise strategy. 
We rely extensively on information and financial systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our 
business. Disruptions in our systems could harm our ability to conduct our operations.
Given the number of individual transactions we have each year, it is crucial that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our 
business-critical information systems. Our information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, 
computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service 
attacks, security incidents and breaches from a variety of threat actors, including both cybercriminals and nation state-sponsored 
actors, catastrophic events such as fires, major or extended winter storms, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, usage errors 
by our associates or contractors, civil or political unrest or armed hostilities. The availability of our information systems and 
the integrity of data are essential to our business operations, including the processing of transactions, management of our 
associates, facilities, logistics, inventories, physical stores and clubs and our online operations. Our information systems are not 
fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. If our systems are damaged, breached, 
attacked, interrupted or otherwise cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace 
them, and may experience loss or corruption of data as well as suffer interruptions in our business operations in the interim. 
Any interruption to the availability of our information systems or corruption of our data may have a material adverse effect on 
our business or results of operations. In addition, the cost of securing our systems against failure or attack is considerable, and 
increases in these costs, particularly in the wake of a breach or failure, could be significant. 
In addition, we frequently update our information technology hardware, software, processes and systems. The risk of system 
disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken. If we fail to timely or successfully integrate and 
update our information systems and processes, we may fail to realize the cost savings or operational benefits anticipated to be 
derived from these initiatives. For example, during the first quarter of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, we initiated an 
upgrade to our existing financial system, including our general ledger and other applications. If we are unable to implement this 
upgrade as planned, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected; our ability to 
assess those controls adequately could be delayed; and our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and 
cash flows could be negatively impacted.
If the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online and enable us to deliver 
products and services do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our omni-channel 
business globally, could be materially adversely affected.
Increasingly, customers are using computers, tablets and smart phones to shop with us and with our competitors and to do 
comparison shopping. We use social media, online advertising and email to interact with our customers and as a means to 
enhance their shopping experience. As a part of our omni-channel sales strategy, we offer various pickup, delivery and 
shipping programs including options where many products available for purchase online can be picked up by the customer or 
member at a local Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs. Omni19

channel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations around the world, and we continue to 
make investments in supply chain automation to support our omni-channel strategy. We must anticipate and meet our 
customers' changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in our competitors' operations 
through focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating 
segment. Moreover, some of the various technology systems and services on which we rely are provided and managed by 
third-party service providers. To the extent either our or such other third-party systems and services do not perform or function 
as anticipated, whether because of an inherent flaw in the technology, a faulty implementation or a cybersecurity incident, such 
failure can significantly interfere with our ability to meet our customers' changing expectations. Any disruption or failure on our 
part to provide attractive, user-friendly and secure digital platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise and services at 
competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online 
shoppers and developments in online and digital platform merchandising and related technology in a cost-efficient manner 
could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of eCommerce and other sales, harm our reputation with 
customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our eCommerce business globally and have a material adverse 
impact on our business and results of operations.
Any failure to maintain the privacy or security of the information relating to our company, customers, members, 
associates, business partners and vendors, whether as a result of cyberattacks on our information systems or otherwise, 
could damage our reputation, result in litigation or other legal actions against us, result in fines, penalties, and liability, 
cause us to incur substantial additional costs and materially adversely affect our business and operating results.
Like most retailers, we process in our information systems personal information and/or payment information about our 
customers and members, and we also process information concerning our associates and vendors. In addition, our health and 
wellness business operations, the Walmart Health locations, and third-party service providers who handle information on our 
behalf, store and maintain personal health information. Some of this information is stored digitally in connection with the 
digital platforms and technologies that we use to conduct and facilitate our various businesses. We utilize third-party service 
providers for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, for digital storage technology, compute capacity, content 
delivery to customers and members, back-office support and other functions. Such providers may have access to information 
we hold about our customers, members, associates, business partners or vendors. In addition, our eCommerce operations 
depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting 
cashless payments.
Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for disrupting or obtaining access to information systems or 
information stored in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated and frequent, and in some cases, 
they may lead to successful attacks. Unauthorized activities directed against information systems and devices, whether our own 
or those of our third-party service providers and vendors, have resulted in cybersecurity incidents, including malware, 
ransomware, denial of service attacks or phishing incidents. We expect that our information systems and those of our thirdparty service providers, vendors and suppliers will continue to experience such attempted attacks in the future, which could 
include disruptions to our supply chain system. Cyberattacks and threat actors can be sponsored by particular nation-states, or 
be the work of sophisticated criminal organizations, insiders (including our associates or contractors) or third parties, each with 
a wide-range of motives and expertise. We and the businesses with which we interact have experienced and continue to 
experience incidents and threats to data and information systems. These incidents and threats have included and are likely to 
continue to include both random and targeted cyberattacks, computer viruses, phishing incidents, worms, bot attacks, 
ransomware or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate customer information, including credit 
card and payment information, and cause system failures and disruptions. The increased use of remote work infrastructure in 
recent years has also increased the possible attack surfaces to be exploited. Our logging capabilities, or the logging capabilities 
of third parties, are also not always complete or sufficiently detailed, affecting our ability to fully investigate and understand the 
scope of security events. As noted above, some of our information systems and those of our third-party service providers have 
experienced cybersecurity incidents or breaches and, although to date they have not had a material adverse effect on our 
operating results, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future.
Our digital platforms, which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope, and the 
systems on which they run, including those applications and systems used in legacy operations and acquired eCommerce, 
technology or other businesses, are regularly subject to cyberattacks. Those attacks involve attempts to impede the operations 
of our system or gain unauthorized access to our eCommerce websites (including marketplace platforms) or mobile commerce 
applications to obtain and misuse customers' or members' information including personal information and/or payment 
information and related risks discussed in this Item 1A. Such attacks, if successful, may result in potential data misuse and/or 
loss and may create denials of service or otherwise disable, degrade or sabotage the information systems that enable or support 
one or more of our digital platforms or otherwise significantly disrupt our customers' and members' shopping experience, our 
supply chain integrity and continuity and our ability to efficiently operate our business. If we are unable to maintain the 
security of the information systems that enable or support our digital platforms and keep them operating within acceptable 
parameters, we could suffer loss of sales, reductions in transactions, reputational damage and deterioration of our competitive 

position and incur liability for any damage to customers, members or others whose personal or confidential information is 
unlawfully obtained and misused, any of which events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of 
operations and impede the execution of our strategy for the growth of our business.
Associate error or malfeasance, faulty password management, social engineering or other vulnerabilities and irregularities may 
also result in a defeat of our security measures or those of our third-party service providers and a compromise or breach of our 
or their information systems. Moreover, the hardware, software or applications that comprise our information system and 
networked environment may have vulnerabilities or defects of design, coding, manufacture or operations that could be 
intentionally exploited or inadvertently used in a manner that could compromise information security. Given the age, size and 
complexity of these information systems and our networked environment, patches for certain vulnerabilities may not exist and, 
even where patches or other risk-mitigating activities are available, the deployment of patches or execution of risk-mitigating 
actions may not occur before an underlying vulnerability is exploited by threat actors or inadvertently results in the compromise 
of our information systems or data. 
Any compromise of our information systems or of those of businesses with which we interact, which results in regulated data or 
confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged, disclosed, destroyed, modified, lost or used by unauthorized 
persons could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions (including, with respect to health information, liability 
under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or "HIPAA"), customer attrition, remediation expenses 
and claims from customers, members, associates, vendors, financial institutions, payment card networks and other persons, any 
of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial position and results of operations. 
Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems or data change 
frequently and may not immediately produce signs of a compromise, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to 
implement adequate preventative measures, or detect the activities of a threat actor. Even if we detect a cybersecurity incident, 
the nature and extent of that cybersecurity incident may not be immediately clear. Based on the sophistication of the threat 
actors and the size and complexity of our information systems and networked environment, among other factors, an 
investigation into a cybersecurity incident could take a significant amount of time to complete. We may not understand or 
appreciate that what is detected and treated as multiple individual cybersecurity incidents or events may be associated with the 
coordinated actions of a single threat actor. In addition, while our investigation of a cybersecurity incident is ongoing, we may 
not know the full extent of the harm caused by a threat actor, and such harm may spread both internally and to certain 
customers, vendors, or other third parties. These factors may inhibit our ability to provide rapid, complete and reliable 
information about the cybersecurity incident to customers, counterparties and regulators, as well as the public. It may also not 
be clear how best to contain and remediate any harm caused by the cybersecurity incident, and certain errors or actions could be 
repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated. Any or all of these factors could further increase the costs 
and consequences of a cybersecurity incident on our business operations, financial position and results of operations. 
To the extent that any cyberattack, ransomware or incursion in our or one of our third-party service provider's information 
systems results in the loss, damage, misappropriation or other compromise of information, we may be materially adversely 
affected by claims from customers, members, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card networks and others.
Our compliance programs, information technology and enterprise risk management efforts cannot eliminate all systemic risk. 
Disruptions in our systems caused by associate error or malfeasance, security incidents, breaches or cyberattacks – including 
attacks on those parties we do business with (such as strategic partners, suppliers, banks or utility companies) – could harm our 
ability to conduct our operations, which may have a material effect on us, may result in losses that could have a material 
adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations, or may have a cascading effect that adversely impacts our 
partners, third-party service providers, customers, members, financial services firms and other third parties that we interact with 
on a regular basis.
Our reputation with our customers and members is important to the success of our enterprise strategy, which combines 
traditional retail, membership models, marketplaces, financial services, healthcare, and other customer and business services 
into a series of interconnected assets to make it seamless for customers to interact with us. Security-related events could be 
widely publicized and could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, members, associates, vendors and 
shareholders, could harm our competitive position particularly with respect to our eCommerce operations, and could result in a 
material reduction in our net sales in our eCommerce operations, as well as in our stores thereby materially adversely affecting 
our operations, net sales, growth rates, operating income, results of operations, financial position, cash flows and liquidity. 
Such events could also result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and financial position 
and performance and could result in litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or 
liabilities, which may not be covered by our insurance policies. Moreover, a security compromise or operationally impactful 
malware event, such as ransomware, could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems 
created by the issue and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to guard 
personal and confidential information against cyberattacks and other attempts to access or otherwise compromise such 
information and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our digital operations.

We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, electronic benefits transfer 
(EBT) cards, mobile payments and our private label credit cards and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over 
time, which may have information security risk implications. As a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment, we are 
subject to various industry data protection standards and protocols, such as payment network security operating guidelines and 
the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. We cannot be certain that the security measures we or our third-party 
suppliers maintain are able to detect, prevent or contain cyberattacks, cyberterrorism, security incidents, breaches or other 
compromises from malware, ransomware or other threats that are known or may be developed in the future. In certain 
circumstances, our contracts with payment card processors and payment card networks (such as Visa, Mastercard, American 
Express and Discover) generally require us to adhere to payment card network rules which could make us liable to payment 
card issuers and others if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we process is 
compromised, which liabilities could be substantial. 
Additionally, through various financial service partners and our ONE fintech venture, we offer various services such as money 
transfers, digital payment platforms, bill payment, money orders, check cashing, prepaid access, co-branded credits cards, 
installment lending and earned wage access. These products and services require us to comply with legal and regulatory 
requirements, including those related to privacy, information security, anti-money laundering and sanctions regimes and 
consumer protection, under both U.S. state and federal laws and regulations, as well as those of certain other countries. Failure 
to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, sanctions, penalties and harm to our reputation.
We also have compliance obligations associated with privacy laws enacted to protect and regulate the collection, use, retention, 
disclosure and transfer of personal information, which include liability for security and privacy breaches. Among other 
obligations, breaches may trigger obligations under U.S. federal and state laws and those in certain other countries to notify 
affected individuals, government agencies and the media. Consequently, cybersecurity incidents that result in a data breach 
could subject us to fines, sanctions and other legal liability and harm our reputation. 
Changes in third-party reimbursements and contracts, type or scope of offerings of our health and wellness business or 
the Walmart Health business could adversely affect our overall results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
We have retail pharmacy operations in our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments across the U.S. and in various of our 
international markets such as Canada and Mexico. We also provide management services to Walmart Health centers that offer 
medical, dental, behavioral health and other health services in a number of states, as well as a national telehealth service 
provider. In addition, our 10-year collaboration with UnitedHealth Group includes agreements for Walmart Health to provide 
value-based care to patients in certain areas of the U.S., among other initiatives. 
A large majority of our retail pharmacy net sales are generated by filling prescriptions for which we receive payment through 
established contractual relationships with third-party payers and payment administrators, such as private insurers, governmental 
agencies and pharmacy benefit managers ("PBMs"). Our retail pharmacy operations are subject to numerous risks, including: 
reductions in the third-party reimbursement rates for drugs; changes in our payer mix (i.e., shifts in the relative distribution of 
our pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and programs with less favorable 
reimbursement terms); changes in third-party payer drug formularies (i.e., the schedule of prescription drugs approved for 
reimbursement or which otherwise receive preferential coverage treatment); growth in, and our participation in or exclusion 
from, pharmacy payer network arrangements, including exclusive and preferred pharmacy network arrangements operated by 
PBMs and/or any insurance plan or program; increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic prescription drugs we 
sell; increases in the administrative burdens associated with seeking third-party reimbursement; changes in the frequency with 
which new brand name pharmaceuticals become available to consumers; introduction of lower cost generic drugs as substitutes 
for existing brand name drugs for which there was no prior generic drug competition; changes in drug mix (i.e., the relative 
distribution of drugs customers purchase at our pharmacies between brands and generics); changes in the health insurance 
market generally; changes in the scope of or the elimination of Medicare Part D or Medicaid drug programs; increased 
competition from other retail pharmacy operations including competitors offering online retail pharmacy options and/or home 
delivery options; further consolidation and strategic alliances among third-party payers, PBMs or purchasers of drugs; overall 
economic conditions and the ability of our pharmacy customers to pay for drugs prescribed for them to the extent the costs are 
not reimbursed by a third-party; failure to meet any performance or incentive thresholds to which our level of third-party 
reimbursement may be subject; changes in laws or regulations or the practices of third-party payers and PBMs related to the use 
of third-party financial assistance to assist our pharmacy customers with paying for drugs prescribed for them; and any 
additional changes in the state or federal regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy industry and the pharmaceutical 
industry, including as a result of health reform efforts, and other changes to or novel interpretations of existing state or federal 
laws, rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy business.
If the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of our vendors were to be disrupted for any reason, our 
pharmacy operations could be severely affected until at least such time as we could obtain a new supplier for such 
pharmaceuticals. Any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a significant number of our pharmacy 
customers transferring their prescriptions to other pharmacies.

reimbursement rates for services; changes in our payer mix; changes in the health insurance market generally; our inability to 
retain and negotiate favorable contracts with private third-party payers, including managed care plans; competition for patients 
from other healthcare providers, including those that offer telehealth services; changes to healthcare provider utilization 
practices and treatment methodologies; trends toward value-based purchasing and price transparency; overall economic 
conditions and the ability of patients to pay for services; staffing challenges, including retention of a sufficient number and 
quality of healthcare professionals; compliance with the complex and extensive laws and regulations governing the healthcare 
industry; changes in laws and regulations, including as a result of health reform efforts; and healthcare technology initiatives, 
including those related to patient data and interoperability; and public health conditions.
One or a combination of the factors above may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we 
sell, our cost of sales associated with our retail pharmacy operations, and the net sales and gross margin of those operations or 
result in the loss of cross-store or cross-club selling opportunities. In addition, these and other factors may adversely affect the 
type, volume and mix of services we provide, the reimbursement we receive for health and wellness services rendered, and the 
scope and pace of expansion of Walmart Health and related offerings. Any of these developments could, in turn, adversely 
affect our overall net sales, other results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
Our failure to attract and retain qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes in laws and other 
labor issues could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
Our ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing 
number of qualified associates globally. Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to 
fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs, distribution and fulfillment centers and corporate offices, while 
controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the 
availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate, unemployment 
levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of 
new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. Additionally, our ability to successfully execute organizational 
changes, including our enterprise strategy and management transitions within our senior leadership, and to effectively motivate 
and retain associates are critical to our business success. We compete for talent with other retail and non-retail businesses, 
including, for example, technology, health and wellness and fintech businesses, and invest significant resources in training and 
motivating our associates. Increased competition among potential employers at all levels, including senior management and 
executive levels, could result in increased associate costs or make it more difficult to recruit and retain associates. If we are 
unable to locate, attract or retain qualified personnel, or manage leadership transition successfully, the quality of service we 
provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected.
In addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new, revised or novel interpretations of existing 
labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws, including those related to worker classification, are adopted or implemented 
that further increase our labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.
Financial Risks
Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility 
of our stock.
We believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure 
to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our consolidated net sales, consolidated operating income, growth 
rates, eCommerce growth rates, advertising and other higher-margin initiatives (which is expected to help drive our operating 
income growth at a rate faster than net sales over the long term), capital expenditures, comparable store and club sales growth 
rates or earnings and adjusted earnings per share could cause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our 
dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies, changes in our effective tax rates, changes in our financial estimates and 
recommendations by securities analysts or, failure of our performance to compare favorably to that of other retailers may have a 
negative effect on the price of our stock. 
Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported 
results of operations.
Our operations in countries other than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries. Our 
Consolidated Financial Statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate 
the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the U.S. from local 
currencies into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. In recent years, fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
that were unfavorable have had adverse effects on our reported results of operations.
As a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may 
also result in our Consolidated Financial Statements reflecting significant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial 

performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be 
without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates. Such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely 
affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our 
reported consolidated results of operations.
We may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores, clubs and eCommerce platforms around the world with a currency 
other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold. When we must acquire the currency to pay for 
such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us, our cost of sales may 
increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our 
costs, with a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit. Consequently, unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange 
rates have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our results of operations. 
Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks
Our international operations subject us to legislative, judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax, political and economic 
risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our 
business or financial performance.
In addition to our U.S. operations, we operate retail and eCommerce businesses in Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, 
China, India and Mexico.
During fiscal 2024, our Walmart International operations generated approximately 18% of our consolidated net sales. Walmart 
International's operations in various countries also source goods and services from other countries. Our future operating results 
in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors 
include political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions, legal and regulatory 
constraints, such as regulation of product and service offerings including regulatory restrictions (such as foreign ownership 
restrictions) on eCommerce and retail operations in international markets, such as India, restrictive governmental actions (such 
as trade protection measures or nationalization), antitrust and competition law regulatory matters (such as those underway in 
Canada, Mexico and India (relating to our Flipkart subsidiary)), local product safety and environmental laws, tax regulations, 
local labor laws, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, trade policies, foreign exchange or currency regulations, laws and 
regulations regarding consumer and data protection, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, 
now or in the future.
Changing our operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade or newly imposed sanctions can 
be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to our operations, and such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance 
notice and we may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. In addition, tensions between 
nation-state governments and conflicts of laws may lead to challenges for our operations. If disputes and conflicts further 
escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could adversely 
affect our business or financial performance and our reputation. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international 
disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could also adversely affect our business 
or financial performance and our reputation. The economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the 
past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they recur, could adversely affect our financial 
performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies 
of the U.S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar 
organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries that have historically been less stable 
than the U.S. Additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties 
of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in 
countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing business 
outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to 
differences in culture, geopolitical tensions or events, laws and regulations.
In foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention 
of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign 
Corrupt Practices Act or U.S. sanctions laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries. We maintain global 
policies which appropriately regulate such business practices and have in place global compliance programs designed to ensure 
compliance with these laws and regulations. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates, 
contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or 
the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are appropriately regulated 
by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations, 
even if prohibited by our internal policies, could subject us to fines and penalties and adversely affect our business or financial 
performance and our reputation.

Changes in tax and trade laws, regulations and interpretations could materially adversely affect our financial 
performance.
In fiscal 2024, our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club operating segments generated approximately 82% of our consolidated net 
sales. Significant changes in tax and trade policies, including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the 
U.S. and other countries where we source many of the products we sell in our stores and clubs could have an adverse effect on 
our business and financial performance. A significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our U.S. stores and clubs is 
manufactured in other countries. Any such actions including the imposition of further tariffs on imports could increase the cost 
to us of such merchandise (whether imported directly or indirectly) and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such 
merchandise to our customers, which could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our U.S. and international 
operations as well as our business.
We are subject to income taxes, other taxes and tax collection and reporting obligations in both the U.S. and the foreign 
jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. The determination of our worldwide provision for 
income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. Our taxes could be materially 
adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than 
anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and 
liabilities, or by changes in worldwide tax laws, tax rates, regulations or accounting principles and the interpretations of those 
rules. In addition, we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply 
with new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date of those obligations.
We are also exposed to future tax legislation, as well as the issuance of future regulations and changes in administrative 
interpretations of existing tax laws, and changes in transfer pricing arrangements with our subsidiaries, any of which can impact 
our or our subsidiaries current and future years' tax provision. The effect of such changes in tax law, changes in administrative 
interpretations of existing tax laws or changes in transfer pricing arrangements could also have a material effect on our 
business, financial position and results of operations. In the U.S., the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act") 
significantly changed federal income tax laws that affect U.S. corporations. As further guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury 
Department, the Internal Revenue Service, and other standard-setting bodies, any resulting changes in our estimates will be 
treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. Compliance with the Tax Act and any other new tax rules, 
regulations, guidance and interpretations, including collecting information not regularly produced by us or unexpected changes 
in our estimates, may require us to incur additional costs and could affect our results of operations.
In addition, legislatures and taxing authorities in many jurisdictions in which we operate may enact changes to or seek to 
enforce novel interpretations of their tax rules. These changes could include modifications that have temporary effect and more 
permanent changes. For example, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the "OECD"), the European 
Union and other countries (including countries in which we operate) have committed to enacting substantial changes to 
numerous long-standing tax principles impacting how large multinational enterprises are taxed. In particular, the OECD's Pillar 
Two initiative introduces a 15% global minimum tax applied on a country-by-country basis, which became effective in many 
jurisdictions in which we operate starting January 1, 2024. The impact of these potential new rules as well as any other changes 
in domestic and international tax rules and regulations could have a material effect on our effective tax rate.
Furthermore, we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the 
prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations, legislation and interpretations. Although we believe our tax 
estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our Consolidated 
Financial Statements and may materially affect our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for 
which such determination and settlement is made.
Changes in and/or failure to comply with other laws, regulations and interpretations of such laws and regulations 
specific to the businesses and jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect our reputation, market 
position or our business and financial performance.
We operate in complex regulated environments in the U.S. and in other countries in which we operate and could be materially 
adversely affected by changes to existing legal requirements including the related interpretations and enforcement practices, 
new legal requirements and/or any failure to comply with applicable regulations. In addition, the degree of regulatory, political, 
and media scrutiny we face increases the likelihood that our efforts to adhere our practices and procedures to comply with these 
laws and legal requirements may be subject to frequent or increasing challenges.
Our health and wellness operations in the U.S. and the operations of the Walmart Health locations are subject to numerous 
federal, state and local laws and regulations including, but not limited to, those related to: licensing, reimbursement 
arrangements and other requirements and restrictions; registration and regulation of pharmacies; dispensing and sale of 
controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine; governmental (including Medicare and Medicaid) and 
commercial reimbursement; data privacy and security and the sharing and interoperability of data, including obligations and 
restrictions related to health information (such as those imposed under HIPAA); billing and coding for healthcare services and 
properly handling overpayments; debt collection; necessity and adequacy of healthcare services; relationships with referral 

sources and referral recipients and other fraud and abuse issues, such as those addressed by anti-kickback and false claims laws 
and patient inducement regulations; qualification of healthcare practitioners; quality and standards of medical services and 
equipment; and the practice of the professions of pharmacy, medical, dental and behavioral healthcare services, including 
limitations on the corporate practice of medicine in certain states. 
Health-related legislation at the federal and state level may have an adverse effect on our business or require us to modify 
certain aspects of our operations. For example, in the U.S., the Drug Enforcement Administration ("DEA") and various other 
regulatory authorities regulate the purchase, distribution, maintenance and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled 
substances. We are required to hold valid DEA and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards and 
comply with the federal and various state-controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale, dispensing, 
disposal and holding of controlled substances. The DEA, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and state regulatory 
authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, 
civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. In addition, there has been recent heightened 
governmental and public scrutiny of pharmaceutical product pricing, which has resulted in federal and state legislation and 
regulations, executive orders and other initiatives and proposals designed to increase transparency in pharmaceutical product 
pricing and reform government program reimbursement methodologies (for example, the Inflation Reduction Act, which 
includes, among other matters, policies designed to impact drug prices and reduce drug spending by the federal government). 
Other health reform efforts at the federal and state levels may also impact our business or require us to modify certain aspects of 
our operations. We may not be able to predict the nature or success of reform initiatives, and the resulting uncertainties may 
have an adverse effect on our business. 
We are also governed by foreign, national and state laws and regulations of general applicability, including laws and regulations 
related to competition and antitrust matters; protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including exposure to, 
and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances; food and drug safety, including drug supply chain security 
requirements; trade, consumer protection, and safety, including the availability, sale, price label accuracy, advertisement and 
promotion of products we sell and the financial services we offer (including through our digital channels, stores and clubs, as 
well as our ONE fintech venture); anti-money laundering prohibitions; consumer financial protection laws; economic, trade and 
other sanctions matters; licensure, certification and enrollment with government programs; data privacy and cybersecurity and 
the sharing and interoperability of data; working conditions, workplace health and safety, equal employment opportunity, 
worker classification, employee benefit and other labor and employment matters; and health and wellness related regulations for 
our pharmacy operations outside of the U.S. In addition, certain financial services we offer or make available are subject to 
U.S. and international legal and regulatory requirements, including those intended to help detect and prevent money laundering, 
fraud and other illicit activity, as well as consumer financial protections and sanctions laws. Failure to meet these requirements 
could affect the profitability of our business activities; limit our ability to pursue business opportunities or conduct business in 
certain jurisdictions; require changes to business practices or governance or alter our relationships with our customers, partners 
and other third parties, including our ability to continue certain relationships in Mexico, India or other international 
jurisdictions; result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight and compliance, litigation-related settlements, judgments 
or expenses, restitution to customers or the imposition of fines or monetary penalties. Increased U.S. regulation of non-bank 
financial institutions may also result in additional requirements and scrutiny of certain financial services we offer. 
Increasing governmental and societal attention to ESG matters, including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting 
diligence, and disclosure topics such as climate change, sustainability (including with respect to our supply chain), natural 
resources, waste reduction, energy, human capital and risk oversight could expand the nature, scope and complexity of matters 
that we are required to control, assess and report.
Data privacy and protection laws or customer expectations relating to the collection, use, retention, disclosure, transfer and 
processing of personal information continue to undergo a rapid transformation in the U.S. and in non-U.S. jurisdictions. 
Recently enacted state laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), in a number of states that have become 
effective, or will soon be effective, have created a substantially more complex regulatory regime associated with data-handling 
practices. Moreover, other laws and regulations related to data-handling and privacy that apply to our business, such as the 
Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), the United 
Kingdom's General Data Protection Regulation (which implements the GDPR into U.K. law), China's Personal Information 
Protection Act ("PIPL"), and similar legislation in Quebec Canada further increases the compliance obligations of our business. 
Certain of these laws have required us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and 
expenses to comply, which we anticipate will continue in the future. These and other privacy and cybersecurity laws may carry 
significant potential damages and civil penalties for noncompliance. For example, in the case of non-compliance with a material 
provision of the GDPR (such as non-adherence to the core principles of processing personal data), regulators have the authority 
to levy a fine in an amount that is up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of global annual turnover (i.e., revenue) in the prior 
year. These administrative fines are discretionary and based, in each case, on a multi-factored approach. Further, PIPL took 
effect in China in November 2021. PIPL raises the protection requirements for processing personal information and requires 
government approval to either allow the access of personal information in China by someone outside of China or conduct 
personal data transfers outside of China. Fines for PIPL violations range from approximately RMB 50 million to up to 5% of 

the infringing company's previous year's revenues generated from within China. We have made changes, and we may in the 
future make additional adjustments to our business practices, to comply with the personal information protection laws and 
regulations in China as they evolve. Residents in jurisdictions with comprehensive privacy laws have rights to access, correct 
and require deletion of their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed 
information about how their personal information is used and may have a private right of action for data breaches. Furthermore, 
our marketing and customer engagement activities are subject to communications privacy laws such as the Telephone 
Consumer Protection Act. We may be subjected to penalties and other consequences for noncompliance, including changing 
some portions of our business. Even an unsuccessful challenge by customer or regulatory authorities of our activities could 
result in adverse publicity, impact our reputation and could require a costly response from and defense by us.
The impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations, as well as changes in enforcement practices or 
regulatory scrutiny as to existing laws and regulations (including, but not limited to, in the U.S., shifting enforcement priorities 
for existing antitrust, competition and pricing laws, as well as proposed new rules and regulations) generally cannot be 
predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices of 
existing laws and regulations may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our 
operating costs, require significant capital expenditures, or adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or 
services we offer, or result in adverse publicity and harm our reputation. If we fail to predict or respond adequately to changes, 
including by implementing strategic and operational initiatives, or do not respond as effectively as our competitors, our 
business, operations and financial performance may be adversely affected.
In addition, we may face audits or investigations by one or more government agencies relating to our compliance with 
applicable laws and regulations. The regulatory, political and media scrutiny we face, which may continue, amplifies these 
risks. To the extent a regulator or court disagrees with our interpretation of these laws and determines that our practices are not 
in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties that could adversely 
affect the continued operation of our businesses, including: suspension of payments from government programs; loss of 
required licenses and certifications; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs, including 
the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the U.S.; termination from contractual relationships, including those with our drug 
suppliers and third-party payers; and significant fines or monetary damages. Failure to comply with applicable legal or 
regulatory requirements in the U.S. or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial 
exposure, damage to our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial position and results 
of operations.
We are subject to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results 
of operations, financial position and liquidity.
We operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment. We are involved in legal proceedings, including litigation, 
arbitration and other claims, and investigations, inspections, audits, claims, inquiries and similar actions by pharmacy, 
healthcare, tax, environmental and other governmental authorities. We may also have indemnification obligations for legal 
commitments of certain businesses we have divested. Legal proceedings, in general, and securities, derivative action and class 
action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these suits may purport or may be 
determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or 
exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. For example, we are currently a defendant in a number of 
cases containing class or collective-action allegations, or both, in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and 
state wage and hour laws, as well as a number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought 
claims under federal and state consumer laws.
We have been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities related to 
nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids. We are also a defendant in numerous 
litigation proceedings related to opioids, including the consolidated multidistrict litigation entitled In re National Prescription 
Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and a lawsuit 
filed against us by the United States Department of Justice in the District of Delaware in 2020. Similar cases that name us also 
have been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, healthcare providers and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs in these 
cases are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. We have entered into a 
settlement framework to resolve certain of these matters and accrued a liability for approximately $3.3 billion, almost all of 
which was paid in fiscal 2024. We cannot predict the ultimate number of opioids-related claims that may be filed or their 
outcomes and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from opioids-related matters. 
In addition, in July 2021, the Directorate of Enforcement in India issued a show cause notice to Flipkart and other parties 
requesting the recipients show cause as to why further proceedings under India's Foreign Direct Investment rules and 
regulations should not be initiated against them based on alleged violations that related to a period prior to our acquisition of a 
majority stake in Flipkart in 2018. Also, in October 2023, the main Mexican operating subsidiary of Wal-Mart de México was 
notified of the initiation of a quasi-judicial administrative process against it for alleged relative monopolistic practices in 
connection with the supply and wholesale distribution of certain consumer goods, retail marketing practices of such consumer 

goods and related services. Because this process is at an early stage, we cannot provide any assurance as to the scope and 
outcome of this matter, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from this matter.
We can provide no assurance as to the scope or outcome of any proceeding that might result from the notice, the amount of 
proceeds we may receive in indemnification, and can provide no assurance as to whether there will be a material adverse effect 
to our business or Consolidated Financial Statements. We are also a defendant in litigation with the Federal Trade Commission 
regarding our money transfer agent services and is also cooperating with and responding to subpoenas issued by the U.S. 
Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on behalf of the U.S. Department of Justice regarding our consumer 
fraud prevention program and anti-money laundering compliance related to our money transfer services, where we are an agent. 
We are unable to predict the outcome of the litigation or investigations or any other related actions by governmental entities 
regarding these matters and can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and whether our business, 
financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected. We discuss in more detail these 
cases and other litigation to which we are party below under the caption "Item 3. Legal Proceedings" and in Note 10 in the 
"Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements," which are part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Our amended and restated bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive 
forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could increase the 
costs for our shareholders to bring claims, discourage our shareholders from bringing claims, or limit our shareholders' 
ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, associates or shareholders in 
such capacity.
Our bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the 
State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for claims, including derivative 
claims that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former director, officer, associate or shareholder in such capacity 
or as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery. The exclusive forum 
provision may increase the costs for a shareholder to bring a claim or limit a shareholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial 
forum that the shareholder finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, associates or shareholders in such 
capacity, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these 
provisions of our bylaws inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, the claims as to which they are intended to apply, then 
we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our 
business, financial position or results of operations. While the exclusive forum provision applies to state and federal law claims, 
our shareholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with, and the exclusive forum provision will not preclude 
or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for actions brought under, the federal securities laws, 
including the Exchange Act, as amended, or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated 
thereunder.
Our reputation may be adversely affected if we are not able to satisfy varied stakeholder expectations with respect to 
our ESG goals.
We strive to deliver shared value through our business and our diverse stakeholders expect us to make significant progress in 
certain ESG priority issue areas. Stakeholder expectations regarding ESG matters continue to evolve and are not uniform. We 
have established, and may continue to establish, various goals and initiatives on these matters, including with respect to climate 
change initiatives. We cannot guarantee that we will achieve these goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us 
to achieve these goals and initiatives or to otherwise meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations could adversely affect 
our reputation. We periodically publish information about our ESG priorities, strategies and progress on our corporate website 
and update our ESG reporting from time to time. Achievement of these aspirations and goals is subject to risks and 
uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control, and it is possible that we may fail, or be perceived to have failed, in the 
achievement of our ESG goals or that certain of our customers, associates, shareholders, investors, suppliers, business partners, 
government agencies and non-governmental organizations might not be satisfied with our goals or our efforts toward achieving 
those goals. Certain challenges we face in the achievement of our ESG objectives are also captured within our ESG reporting, 
which is not incorporated by reference into and does not form any part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A failure or 
perceived failure to meet our goals could adversely affect public perception of our business, associate morale or customer or 
shareholder support.

ITEM 1C.
CYBERSECURITY
Walmart seeks to build and maintain the trust of customers, associates, shareholders and other stakeholders with respect to our 
use of technology and data. Our digital trust commitments, in line with our Company's values of service, excellence, integrity 
and respect for the individual, provide a foundation for our approach to cybersecurity.

The Board of Directors, committees of the Board of Directors and management coordinate risk oversight and management 
responsibilities, and cybersecurity represents an important component of our overall approach to enterprise risk management. In 
general, we seek to address cybersecurity risks through a cross-functional approach focused on protecting business operations 
and preserving the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information by identifying, preventing and mitigating 
cybersecurity threats and effectively responding to cybersecurity incidents when they occur.
Board of Directors' oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats
Our Board of Directors, which has primary responsibility for overseeing risk management, has delegated risk management 
oversight responsibility for information systems, information security, data privacy and cybersecurity to the Audit Committee. 
Several of our Board members, including certain members of our Audit Committee, have backgrounds or professional 
experience in risk management, digital platforms, information technology or cybersecurity. 
The Audit Committee receives periodic updates from our Chief Information Security Officer ("CISO"), Chief Technology 
Officer ("CTO") and other members of management on risks related to information systems, information security, data privacy 
and cybersecurity. Specific topics may include updates to our company's approach to cybersecurity risk management; recent 
developments; key initiatives; the threat landscape; trends; and the results of certain assessments and testing. The Board of 
Directors receives regular reports from the Audit Committee chair on these and other risk-related matters as deemed necessary. 
Our CISO or other members of management provide information to the Audit Committee pursuant to risk-based escalation 
protocols for cybersecurity incidents that exceed established reporting thresholds. 
Management's role in assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats
Our CISO leads Walmart's Information Security organization and has responsibility for overseeing our Company's 
cybersecurity program. To operationalize our program, we deploy multidisciplinary teams, including cybersecurity personnel 
and professionals, to address cybersecurity threats and respond to cybersecurity incidents, including for those non-wholly 
owned subsidiaries whose systems have not been fully integrated into Walmart's networks. Through ongoing engagement with 
these teams and certain third-party service providers, our CISO monitors the prevention, detection, mitigation and remediation 
of cybersecurity threats and incidents and reports cybersecurity incidents that reach established thresholds to senior 
management and the Audit Committee, which are also analyzed for external reporting requirements.
Our CISO has been a Walmart associate for over 30 years, has served in various roles in information technology and 
information security at Walmart for almost 20 years, and has received industry-recognized information security certifications. 
Our CTO, to whom the CISO reports, has served as Walmart's CTO since 2019 and prior to that had experience managing 
technology and other risks at several other large public companies.
Risk Management and Strategy
Our cybersecurity program is informed by various industry frameworks including the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology Cybersecurity Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (NIST-CSF Version 1.1), which are 
reflected in our related policies, standards, processes and practices. We may implement changes to our cybersecurity program 
when deemed necessary based on updates to industry standards among other things. We have multiple layers of security 
designed to detect and block cybersecurity events, as well as dedicated teams of cybersecurity personnel and professionals, 
which assist our CISO in helping to assess, identify, monitor, detect and manage cybersecurity risks, threats, vulnerabilities and 
incidents. We collaborate with public and private entities and industry groups and engage third-party service providers to 
expand the capabilities and capacity of our cybersecurity program when deemed necessary. Certain key components of our 
cybersecurity program include the following:
Protecting our technology and information systems: When we implement significant changes to our technologies or 
information systems, we conduct risk-based security and privacy impact assessments and deploy technical safeguards that are 
designed to reasonably protect our technology and information systems from cybersecurity threats. We actively monitor and 
proactively research potential cybersecurity threats to our technologies and information systems. We use what we learn to 
evolve our security controls over time to mitigate risks posed by such threats.
Incident response and recovery planning: We maintain incident response and recovery plans that address our response to 
cybersecurity incidents, including incidents that we become aware of at third parties that support our operations. These plans 
guide how we evaluate and assign incident severity levels and reporting thresholds; escalate and engage incident response 
teams; and manage and mitigate the related risks.
Third-party risk management: We maintain a risk-based approach to identifying and managing cybersecurity threats presented 
to Walmart by third-party systems that support our operations, as well as third-party users of our data and systems, including 
vendors, service providers and subcontractors.
Training and awareness: We provide recurring information security training (which includes cybersecurity training) to our 
associates and certain third parties based on access, risk, roles, policies, standards and behaviors.

Assessments and testing: We engage in periodic assessment and testing of our policies, standards, processes and practices that 
are designed to address cybersecurity threats. These efforts include tabletop exercises, threat modeling, vulnerability testing and 
other exercises focused on evaluating the effectiveness of our cybersecurity measures and planning. We regularly engage third 
parties to assist with our assessments and testing. Where appropriate we adjust our cybersecurity policies, standards, processes 
and practices accordingly based on internal and external assessment and testing results.
Certain of Walmart's systems and those of our third-party service providers have experienced cybersecurity incidents and 
threats. Based on the information available as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are not aware of any risks 
from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any cybersecurity incidents, which have materially affected us or are 
reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. Despite 
our security measures, however, there can be no assurance that we, or the third parties with which we interact, will not 
experience a cybersecurity incident in the future that will materially affect us. Additional information about cybersecurity risks 
we face is discussed in "Item 1A. Risk Factors," which should be read in conjunction with the information above.

We own office facilities in Bentonville, Arkansas, that serve as our principal office and own and lease office facilities 
throughout the U.S. and internationally for operations as well as for field and market management. The land on which our 
stores are located is either owned or leased by the Company. We use independent contractors to construct our buildings. All 
store leases provide for annual rentals, some of which escalate during the original lease or provide for additional rent based on 
sales volume. Substantially all of the Company's store and club leases have renewal options, some of which include rent 
escalation clauses. For further information on our distribution centers, see the caption "Distribution" provided for each of our 
segments under "Item 1. Business."
ITEM 3.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
I. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: The Company is involved in legal proceedings arising in the normal course of its 
business, including litigation, arbitration and other claims, and investigations, inspections, subpoenas, audits, claims, inquiries 
and similar actions by governmental authorities. We discuss certain legal proceedings in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial 
Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," which is captioned "Contingencies," under the 
sub-caption "Legal Proceedings." We refer you to that discussion for important information concerning those legal 
proceedings, including the basis for such actions and, where known, the relief sought. We provide the following additional 
information concerning those legal proceedings, including the name of the lawsuit, the court in which the lawsuit is pending, 
and the date on which the petition commencing the lawsuit was filed.
Prescription Opiate Litigation: In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the "MDL"). The MDL is 
pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and includes over 340 cases as of March 4, 2024. The 
liability phase of a single, two-county trial in one of the MDL cases against a number of parties, including the Company, 
regarding opioid dispensing claims resulted in a jury verdict on November 23, 2021, finding in favor of the plaintiffs as to the 
liability of all defendants, including the Company. The abatement phase of the single, two-county trial resulted in a judgment 
on August 17, 2022, that ordered all three defendants, including the Company, to pay an aggregate amount of approximately 
$0.7 billion over fifteen years, on a joint and several liability basis, and granted the plaintiffs injunctive relief. The Company 
has filed an appeal with the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The monetary aspect of the judgment is stayed pending appeal, and 
the injunctive portion of the judgment went into effect on February 20, 2023. On September 11, 2023, the Sixth Circuit Court 
of Appeals issued an order certifying certain questions in the appeal for review by the Supreme Court of Ohio. On November 
29, 2023, the Supreme Court of Ohio accepted the request for certification, and the matter remains pending with that court. On 
October 25, 2023, the MDL designated four cases brought by third-party payers as bellwether cases to proceed through 
discovery. Additional bellwethers of cases brought by hospitals and other healthcare providers may be designated in the future. 
In addition, there are over 50 other cases pending in state and federal courts throughout the country against the Company as of 
March 4, 2024, as well as other cases in Canada against Wal-Mart Canada Corp. and certain other subsidiaries of the Company. 
The case citations and currently scheduled trial dates, where applicable, are listed on Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on 
Form 10-K.
Opioid Settlement Framework: On November 15, 2022, the Company announced that it had agreed to a Settlement 
Framework to resolve substantially all opioids-related lawsuits filed against the Company by states, political subdivisions, and 
Native American tribes (other than the single, two-county trial on appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals as described 
above), as described in more detail in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company now has settlement 
agreements with all 50 states, including four states that previously settled with the Company, as well as the District of 
Columbia, Puerto Rico and three other U.S. territories, that are intended to resolve substantially all opioids-related lawsuits 
brought by state and local governments against the Company. As described in more detail in Note 10 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements, the Settlement Framework became effective on September 6, 2023, and as of January 31, 2024 
substantially all of the original approximately $3.3 billion accrued liability for the Settlement Framework and other settlements 
have been paid.
DOJ Opioid Civil Litigation: A civil complaint pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware has been filed 
by the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") against the Company, in which the DOJ alleges violations of the Controlled 
Substances Act related to nationwide distribution and dispensing of opioids. U.S. v. Walmart Inc., et al., USDC, Dist. of DE, 
12/22/20. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. After the parties had fully briefed 
the Company's motion to dismiss, the DOJ filed an amended complaint on October 7, 2022. On November 7, 2022, the 
Company filed a partial motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The Court held a hearing on the partial motion to dismiss on 
January 18, 2024, and ordered the DOJ to file an amended complaint. The DOJ filed that amended complaint on February 1, 
2024, and Walmart filed a partial motion to dismiss that complaint on February 6, 2024. On March 11, 2024, the Court granted 
in-part Walmart's motion by dismissing the entirety of the DOJ's claims related to distribution and dismissing the DOJ's claims 
arising under one of the DOJ's two dispensing liability theories. The DOJ's claims arising under its other dispensing liability 
theory remain pending.

Opioids Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation: Three derivative complaints and two securities class 
actions drawing heavily on the allegations of the DOJ complaint have been filed in Delaware naming the Company and various 
current and former directors and certain current and former officers as defendants. The plaintiffs in the derivative suits (in 
which the Company is a nominal defendant) allege, among other things, that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in 
connection with oversight of opioids dispensing and distribution and that the defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange 
Act, and are liable for contribution under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act in connection with the Company's disclosures 
about opioids. Two of the derivative suits have been filed in the U.S. District Court in Delaware and those suits have been 
stayed pending further developments in other opioids litigation matters. The other derivative suit has been filed in the Delaware 
Court of Chancery. The defendants in the derivative suit pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery moved to dismiss and/or 
to stay that case on December 21, 2021; the plaintiffs responded by filing an amended complaint on February 22, 2022. On 
April 20, 2022, the defendants moved to dismiss and/or stay proceedings on the amended complaint. In two orders issued on 
April 12 and 26, 2023, the Court of Chancery granted the defendants' motion to dismiss with respect to claims involving the 
Company's distribution practices and denied the remainder of the motion, including the Company's request to stay the litigation. 
On May 5, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors appointed an independent Special Litigation Committee (the "SLC") to 
investigate the allegations regarding certain current and former officers and directors named in the various proceedings 
regarding oversight with respect to opioids. The Board has authorized the SLC to retain independent legal counsel and such 
other advisors as the SLC deems appropriate in carrying out its duties. The derivative matter pending in the Delaware Court of 
Chancery is stayed until the SLC completes its investigation. 
The securities class actions, alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act regarding the Company's 
disclosures with respect to opioids, purport to be filed on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 
30, 2016, through December 22, 2020. On May 11, 2021, the U.S. District Court in Delaware consolidated the class actions and 
appointed a lead plaintiff and lead counsel. The defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated securities class action on October 
8, 2021. On October 14, 2022, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which revised the applicable putative class of investors to 
those who acquired Walmart stock from March 31, 2017, through December 22, 2020. On November 16, 2022, the Company 
moved to dismiss the amended complaint. That motion remains pending.
Derivative Lawsuits: Abt v. Alvarez et al., USDC, Dist. of DE, 2/9/21; Nguyen v. McMillon et al., USDC, Dist. of DE, 
4/16/21: Ontario Provincial Council of Carpenters' Pension Trust Fund et al. v. Walton et al., DE Court of Chancery, 9/27/21.
Securities Class Actions: Stanton v. Walmart Inc. et al., USDC, Dist. of DE, 1/20/21 and Martin v. Walmart Inc. et al., USDC, 
Dist. of DE, 3/5/21, consolidated into In re Walmart Inc. Securities Litigation, USDC, Dist. of DE, 5/11/21.

Employment Tribunal); Abbas & Others v Asda Stores limited (KB-2022-003243); and Abusubih & Others v Asda Stores 
limited (KB-2022-003240).
Money Transfer Agent Services Litigation: Federal Trade Commission v. Walmart Inc. (CV-3372), USDC, N. Dist. Of Ill, 
6/28/22.
Mexico Antitrust Matter: Comisión Federal de Competencia Económica of México, Investigative Authority v. Nueva WalMart de México, S.de R.L. de C.V. (Docket IO-002-2020, consolidated with Docket DE-026-2020), Mexico, 10/6/23.
II. CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS: 
Foreign Direct Investment Matters: In July 2021, the Directorate of Enforcement in India issued a show cause notice to 
Flipkart Private Limited and one of its subsidiaries ("Flipkart"), and to unrelated companies and individuals, including certain 
current and former shareholders and directors of Flipkart. The notice requests the recipients to show cause as to why further 
proceedings under India's Foreign Direct Investment rules and regulations (the "Rules") should not be initiated against them 
based on alleged violations during the period from 2009 to 2015, prior to the Company's acquisition of a majority stake in 
Flipkart in 2018. The notice is an initial stage of proceedings under the Rules which could, depending upon the conclusions at 
the end of the initial stage, lead to a hearing to consider the merits of the allegations described in the notice. If a hearing is 
initiated and if it is determined that violations of the Rules occurred, the regulatory authority has the authority to impose 
monetary and/or non-monetary relief. Flipkart has begun the process of responding to the notice and, if the matter progresses to 
a consideration of the merits of the allegations described in the notice is initiated, Flipkart intends to defend against the 
allegations vigorously. Due to the fact that this process is in an early stage, the Company is unable to predict whether the notice 
will lead to a hearing on the merits or, if it does, the final outcome of the resulting proceedings. While the Company does not 
currently believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or 
cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope or outcome of any proceeding that might result from the 
notice, the amount of the proceeds the Company may receive in indemnification from individuals and entities that sold shares to 
the Company under the 2018 agreement pursuant to which the Company acquired its majority stake in Flipkart, and can provide 
no assurance as to whether there will be a material adverse effect to its business or its Consolidated Financial Statements. 

III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS: Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters 
when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that the 
Company reasonably believes will exceed an applied threshold not to exceed $1 million. 
In December 2021, the Office of the Attorney General of the State of California filed suit against the Company, bringing 
enforcement claims regarding Walmart's management of waste consumer products at its California facilities that are alleged to 
be hazardous. The suit was filed in Superior Court of Alameda County, California, Case No. 21CV004367, People v. Walmart 
Inc. Trial is currently set for September 30, 2024. The Company believes it has strong defenses and is vigorously defending 
this litigation matter. While the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, the potential for penalties or 
settlement costs could exceed $1 million. Although the Company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse 
effect on its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the 
scope and outcome of this matter and no assurance as to whether there will be a material adverse effect to its business or its 
Consolidated Financial Statements.
In October 2023, the Company received a Finding of Violation from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") 
alleging violations of the Clean Air Act in connection with the Company's refrigeration leak detection and repair program at 
certain of its facilities. The Company is evaluating the findings and cooperating with the EPA in its investigation. The EPA 
may seek to impose monetary and non-monetary penalties for the alleged violations of the Clean Air Act. Due to the fact that 
this process is in an early stage, the Company is unable to predict the final outcome of this matter. Although the Company does 
not believe this matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows, 
the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope or outcome of this matter and no assurance as to whether there will be a 
material adverse effect to its business or its Consolidated Financial Statements.

ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF 
OPERATIONS
Overview
This discussion, which presents our results for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024 ("fiscal 2024"), January 31, 2023 ("fiscal 
2023") and January 31, 2022 ("fiscal 2022"), should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the 
accompanying notes. We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our 
financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors 
that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's 
performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments to 
provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial position and 
results of operations of the Company as a whole.
Throughout this Item 7, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures. 
Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain 
corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's 
operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision 
maker. 
Management also measures the results of comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, a metric that indicates the 
performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, for a particular period 
from the corresponding period in the previous year. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and 
clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce 
sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated digitally, including omni-channel transactions 
which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs as well as certain other business offerings that are part of our ecosystem, such 
as our Walmart Connect advertising business. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales 
when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square 
feet of more than five percent. Sales related to divested businesses are excluded from comparable sales, and sales related to 
acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as 
"same-store" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail 
industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by 
other companies.
In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the 
operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the effect of 
changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's 
currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange 
rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to 
the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may 
impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the 
future.
On February 23, 2024, the Company effected a 3-for-1 forward split of its common stock and a proportionate increase in the 
number of authorized shares. All share and per share information, including share based compensation, throughout this Annual 
Report on Form 10-K has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split.
We have taken certain strategic actions across our segments, including an increased emphasis on investments in automation and 
supply chain as well as diversifying our earnings streams through category and business mix. Additionally, in the Walmart 
International segment, we have taken strategic actions to reshape our portfolio including the following highlights over the last 
three years:
In February 2021, we completed the sale of Asda for net consideration of $9.6 billion. Refer to Note 12.
In March 2021, we completed the sale of Seiyu for net consideration of $1.2 billion. Refer to Note 12.
In November 2022, we completed the buyout of the noncontrolling interest shareholders of our Massmart subsidiary 
(Refer to Note 3) and in December 2022, we exited operations in certain countries in Africa. 
In December 2022, we increased our ownership in PhonePe as part of the separation from our majority-owned Flipkart 
subsidiary. Refer to Note 3.
We operate in a highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales 
competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as 
well as eCommerce, health and wellness, financial services, advertising and data service businesses. Many of these competitors 
are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence. We 
compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality associates. We, along with other retail companies, are 

influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather and other risks related to climate 
change, global health epidemics and pandemics, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and 
buying patterns, consumer credit availability, disruptions in supply chain, inventory management, cost and availability of 
goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, inflation, deflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic 
conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor availability and costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks 
and unemployment. Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company 
and an investment in its securities can be found herein under "Item 1A. Risk Factors." 
We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low 
costs. Merchandise costs for fiscal 2024 continued to be impacted by inflation, however at a lower rate than we experienced in 
fiscal 2023. The impact to our net sales and gross profit margin is influenced in part by our pricing and merchandising 
strategies in response to cost increases. Those pricing strategies include but are not limited to: absorbing cost increases instead 
of passing those cost increases on to our customers and members; reducing prices in certain merchandise categories; focusing 
on opening price points for certain food categories; and when necessary, passing cost increases on to our customers and 
members. Merchandising strategies include, but are not limited to: working with our suppliers to reduce product costs and share 
in absorbing cost increases; focusing on private label brands and smaller pack sizes; earlier-than-usual purchasing and in greater 
volumes or moderating purchasing in certain categories; and securing ocean carrier and container capacity. These strategies 
have and may continue to impact gross profit as a percentage of net sales.
We expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to inflationary trends; swings in macroeconomic 
conditions and their effect on consumer confidence; volatility in employment trends; supply chain pressures; and ongoing 
uncertainties related to global health epidemics or pandemics, any of which may impact our results. For a detailed discussion 
on results of operations by reportable segment, refer to "Results of Operations" below.
Company Performance Metrics
We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low 
costs. At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which 
we operate. We define our financial priorities as follows: 
Growth - serve customers through a seamless omni-channel experience;
Margin - improve our operating income margin through productivity initiatives as well as category and business mix; 
and
Returns - improve our Return on Investment ("ROI") through margin improvement and disciplined capital spend.
Growth
Our objective of prioritizing growth means we will focus on serving customers and members however they want to shop 
through our omni-channel business model. This includes increasing comparable store and club sales through increasing 
membership at Sam's Club and through Walmart+, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expansion of omni-channel 
initiatives that complement our strategy.
Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales 
for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous 
year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be 
consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. 
However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our 
fiscal calendar, which may result in differences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar. We focus on 
comparable sales in the U.S. as we believe it is a meaningful metric within the context of the U.S. retail market where there is a 
single currency, one inflationary market and generally consistent store and club formats from year to year.
Calendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for fiscal 2024 and 2023, were as follows:

Comparable sales in the U.S., including fuel, increased 4.9% and 8.2% in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively, when compared to 
the previous fiscal year. Walmart U.S. comparable sales increased 5.5% and 7.0% in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. For 
fiscal 2024, comparable sales growth was driven by growth in transactions combined with growth in average ticket, including 
strong sales in grocery and health and wellness. For fiscal 2023, comparable sales growth was driven by growth in average 
ticket, including strong food sales and higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories, as well as growth in 

transactions. Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.6% and 0.7% to comparable sales for 
fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively, which was primarily driven by store pickup and delivery. 
Comparable sales at Sam's Club increased 2.3% and 14.6% in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. For fiscal 2024, Sam's Club 
comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket, including strong sales in grocery and health and 
wellness. Sam's Club comparable sales for fiscal 2023 benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket and included 
higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 
1.7% and 0.8% to comparable sales for fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
Margin
Our objective of prioritizing margin focuses on growth with a focus on incremental margin accretion through a combination of 
productivity improvements as well as category and business mix. We invest in technology and process improvements to 
increase productivity, manage inventory and reduce costs and we operate with discipline by managing expenses and optimizing 
the efficiency of how we work. Additionally, we focus on our mix of businesses, including the expansion of connected value 
streams with higher margins, such as advertising and membership income. Our objective is to achieve operating income 
leverage, which we define as growing operating income at a faster rate than net sales.

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales ("gross profit rate") increased 27 and decreased 98 basis points for fiscal 2024 and 
2023, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2024, the increase was primarily driven by the 
Walmart U.S. segment, due to managing prices aligned to our competitive historic price gaps and lapping higher markdowns 
incurred in the prior year, partially offset by product mix shifts into lower margin categories. For fiscal 2023, the decrease was 
primarily due to markdowns and merchandise mix in the U.S., higher supply chain costs and inflation related LIFO charges in 
the Sam's Club segment.
For fiscal 2024, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 60 basis points when compared to the previous fiscal 
year. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were positively impacted by lapping charges of $3.3 billion related to 
opioid-related legal settlements and $0.8 billion related to the reorganization and restructuring of certain businesses in the 
Walmart International segment in the prior year.
For fiscal 2023, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 23 basis points when compared to the previous fiscal 
year. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were negatively impacted by the charges related to opioid-related legal 
settlements and the reorganization and restructuring of certain businesses in the Walmart International segment discussed 
above. These charges were partially offset by growth in net sales and lower incremental COVID-19 costs.
Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased 83 basis points and decreased 120 basis points for fiscal 2024 and 
2023, respectively, due to the factors described above.
Returns
As we execute our financial framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital 
with our return on assets, return on investment and free cash flow metrics. We also provide returns in the form of share 
repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section.
Return on Assets and Return on Investment 
We include Return on Assets ("ROA"), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ("GAAP"), and Return on Investment ("ROI") as metrics 
to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a 
meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. 
Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. 
ROA was 6.6% and 4.6% for fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in ROA was primarily due to the increase in 
consolidated net income, which was driven by higher operating income. ROI was 15.0% and 12.7% for fiscal 2024 and 2023, 
respectively. The increase in ROI was the result of an increase in operating income, primarily due to lapping charges associated 
with opioid-related legal settlements as well as reorganization and restructuring expenses, all recorded in fiscal 2023, as well as 
improvements in business performance, partially offset by an increase in average invested capital, primarily due to higher 
purchases of property and equipment. 

We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent 
expense) for the trailing twelve months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested 
capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average 
amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period.
Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that 
exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For 
example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the 
numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in 
accordance with GAAP most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net 
income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain 
expense items and adds interest income; and adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we 
believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. 
Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the 
method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI.
The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP 
financial measure, is as follows:

Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which 
measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in 
evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute 
for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our 
liquidity. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating 
activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities.
We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment 
made in that period. We had net cash provided by operating activities of $35.7 billion, $28.8 billion and $24.2 billion for fiscal 
2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We generated free cash flow of $15.1 billion, $12.0 billion and $11.1 billion for fiscal 
2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2024 is primarily due to 
higher cash provided by operating income, as well as timing of certain payments and strategic inventory management as part of 
working capital initiatives, partially offset by payment of the remaining accrued opioid legal charges. Free cash flow for fiscal 
2024 increased when compared to fiscal 2023 due to the increase in operating cash flows described above, partially offset by an 
increase of $3.7 billion in capital expenditures to support our investment strategy. Net cash provided by operating activities for 
fiscal 2023 increased when compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to moderated levels of inventory purchases, partially offset 
by a decline in operating income and the timing of certain payments. Free cash flow for fiscal 2023 increased when compared 
to fiscal 2022 due to the increase in net cash provided by operating activities described above, partially offset by an increase of 
$3.8 billion in capital expenditures to support our investment strategy.

expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual 
obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a 
measure that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. 
As a result, the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other 
companies to calculate their free cash flow.
The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by 
operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as 
information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities.

Our total revenues, which includes net sales and membership and other income, increased $36.8 billion or 6.0% and $38.5 
billion or 6.7% for fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. These increases in revenues 
were primarily due to increases in net sales, which increased $36.8 billion or 6.1% and $38.1 billion or 6.7% for fiscal 2024 and 
2023, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2024, the increase was primarily due to positive 
comparable sales for the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments, which were driven by growth in transactions, combined with 
growth in average ticket, including strong sales in grocery and health and wellness, along with positive comparable sales across 
our international markets. Net sales were positively impacted by $3.0 billion of fluctuations in currency exchange rates during 
fiscal 2024. For fiscal 2023, the increase was primarily due to strong positive comparable sales for the Walmart U.S. and Sam's 
Club segments which was driven by growth in average ticket, including strong food sales and higher inflation impacts in certain 
merchandise categories, as well as growth in transactions, along with positive comparable sales in all of our international 
markets. Additionally, net sales were negatively impacted by a decrease of $5.0 billion related to the divestiture of our 
operations in the U.K. and Japan, which closed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and $3.7 billion of fluctuations in currency 
exchange rates during fiscal 2023. 
Our gross profit rate increased 27 basis points and decreased 98 basis points for fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively, when 
compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2024, the increase was primarily driven by the Walmart U.S. segment, due to 
managing prices aligned to our competitive historic price gaps and lapping higher markdowns incurred in the prior year, 
partially offset by product mix shifts into lower margin categories. For fiscal 2023, the decrease was primarily due to 
markdowns and merchandise mix in the U.S., higher supply chain costs and inflation related LIFO charges in the Sam's Club 
segment.
For fiscal 2024, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 60 basis points when compared to the previous fiscal 
year. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were positively impacted by lapping charges of $3.3 billion related to 
opioid-related legal settlements and $0.8 billion related to the reorganization and restructuring of certain businesses in the 

basis points when compared to the previous fiscal year. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were negatively 
impacted by the charges related to opioid-related legal settlements and the reorganization and restructuring of certain businesses 
in the Walmart International segment discussed above. These charges were partially offset by growth in net sales and lower 
incremental COVID-19 costs. 
Loss on extinguishment of debt was $2.4 billion in fiscal 2022 due to the early retirement of certain higher rate long-term debt 
to reduce interest expense in future periods. There were no such early retirements of debt in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023. 
Other gains and losses consist of certain non-operating items, such as the change in the fair value of our investments and gains 
or losses on business dispositions, which by their nature can fluctuate from period to period. Other gains and losses consisted of 
a net loss of $3.0 billion and $1.5 billion for fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net loss in fiscal 2024 primarily consists of 
net losses associated with the fair value changes of our equity and other investments. The net loss in fiscal 2023 primarily 
consists of: net losses associated with the fair value changes of our equity and other investments; a gain of $0.4 billion 
recognized on the sale of our remaining equity method investment in Brazil; and a $0.2 billion dividend from one of our 
investments.

Our effective income tax rate was 25.5%, 33.6%, and 25.4% for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The higher effective 
tax rate in fiscal 2023 as compared to both fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2022 is primarily due to the tax impact of the business 
reorganization resulting in the full separation of PhonePe from Flipkart in fiscal 2023. Our effective income tax rate may also 
fluctuate as a result of various factors, including changes in our assessment of unrecognized tax benefits, valuation allowances, 
changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our 
U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that are generally higher than the U.S. statutory 
rate. The reconciliation from the U.S. statutory rate to the effective income tax rates for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 is presented 
in Note 9.
As a result of the factors discussed above, we reported $16.3 billion and $11.3 billion of consolidated net income for fiscal 2024 
and 2023, respectively, which represents an increase of $5.0 billion and a decrease of $2.6 billion for fiscal 2024 and 2023, 
respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart 
("EPS") was $1.91, $1.42 and $1.62 for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Net sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased $21.3 billion or 5.1% and $27.3 billion or 6.9% for fiscal 2024 and 2023, 
respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increases in net sales were primarily due to increases in 
comparable sales of 5.5% and 7.0% for fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. Comparable sales in fiscal 2024 were driven by 
growth in transactions combined with growth in average ticket, including strong sales in grocery and health and wellness. 
Comparable sales in fiscal 2023 were driven by growth in average ticket, including strong food sales and higher inflation 
impacts in certain merchandise categories, as well as growth in transactions. Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively 
contributed approximately 2.6% and 0.7% to comparable sales for fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively, which was primarily 
driven by store pickup and delivery.
Gross profit rate increased 20 basis points for fiscal 2024 and decreased 85 basis points for fiscal 2023, when compared to the 
respective previous fiscal year. The increase in fiscal 2024 gross profit rate was primarily due to managing prices aligned to 
our competitive historic price gaps and lapping higher net markdowns incurred in the prior year, partially offset by product mix 
shifts into lower margin categories. The decrease in fiscal 2023 gross profit rate was primarily due to net markdowns and 
product mix shifts into lower margin categories and increased supply chain costs, partially offset by price management impacts 
driven by cost inflation.
Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 9 basis points for fiscal 2024 when compared to the previous 
fiscal year primarily driven by higher variable pay relative to last year as a result of exceeding our planned performance. For 
fiscal 2023, operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 25 basis points primarily driven by strong sales 
growth and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs, partially offset by increased wage costs. 
As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $1.5 billion and decreased $1.0 billion for fiscal 
2024 and 2023, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.

Net sales for the Walmart International segment increased $13.7 billion or 13.5% for fiscal 2024 and were flat for 2023, when 
compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2024, the increase was primarily due to positive comparable sales across our 
international markets and positive fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $3.0 billion during fiscal 2024. For fiscal 2023, net 
sales benefited from positive comparable sales across all of our international markets, offset by the impacts of a decrease of 
$5.0 billion related to the divestiture of our operations in the U.K. and Japan, which closed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, as 
well as $3.7 billion of fluctuations in currency exchange rates during fiscal 2023. 
Gross profit rate increased 20 basis points and decreased 50 basis points for fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively, when compared 
to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2024, the increase was primarily driven by supply chain efficiencies partially offset by 
ongoing format and channel shifts. For fiscal 2023, the decrease was primarily driven by continued growth in lower margin 
formats and channels in China and category mix shifts into lower margin categories.
Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 152 basis points and increased 41 basis points for fiscal 
2024 and 2023, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of 
segment net sales for fiscal 2024 was primarily due to the lapping of business reorganization and restructuring charges incurred 
related to Flipkart and Massmart in fiscal 2023 and an increase in sales in the current year. The increase in operating expenses 
as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2023, was primarily due to incurring these business reorganization and 
restructuring charges. 
As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $1.9 billion and decreased $0.8 billion for fiscal 
2024 and 2023, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.

(1) We believe the "Excluding Fuel" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel 
sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of 
the Sam's Club segment in the future. Management uses such information to better measure underlying operating results in the segment. 
Net sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $1.8 billion or 2.2% and $10.8 billion or 14.7% for fiscal 2024 and 2023, 
respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increases in net sales were primarily due to increases in 
comparable sales, including fuel, of 2.3% and 14.6% for fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. Comparable sales benefited from 
growth in transactions and average ticket, including strong sales in grocery and health and wellness. Additionally, fiscal 2024 
growth was partially offset by lower fuel sales due to deflation in this category. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively 
contributed approximately 1.7% and 0.8% to comparable sales for fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively, which was primarily 
driven by curbside pickup and ship to home.

Gross profit rate increased 55 basis points and decreased 155 basis points for fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively, when 
compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2024, the increase in gross profit rate was primarily due to the lapping of 
elevated markdowns in the prior year, partially offset by product mix shifts into lower margin categories. For fiscal 2023, the 
decrease in gross profit rate was primarily due to inventory markdowns, elevated supply chain and eCommerce fulfillment costs 
and inflation related LIFO charges.
Membership and other income increased 7.5% and 7.0% for fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively, when compared to the previous 
fiscal year. For fiscal 2024 and 2023, the increases were primarily due to growth in membership base and Plus penetration. 
Fiscal 2024 was also positively impacted by higher Plus renewals, as well as the expiration of a promotional offering offsetting 
membership fee increases during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. 
Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 46 basis points and decreased 97 basis points for fiscal 2024 
and 2023, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Fiscal 2024 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales 
increased primarily due to lower fuel sales and elevated technology spend. Fiscal 2023 operating expenses as a percentage of 
net sales decreased primarily due to higher sales. 
As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $0.2 billion and decreased $0.3 billion for fiscal 
2024 and 2023, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity
The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows 
provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund 
our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or 
all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. We 
believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be sufficient to fund operations, finance our global investment activities, pay 
dividends and fund our share repurchases for at least the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future.
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Fiscal Years Ended January 31,
(Amounts in millions)

Net cash provided by operating activities
35,726 
28,841 
24,181 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $35.7 billion, $28.8 billion and $24.2 billion for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, 
respectively. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2024 is primarily due to higher cash provided by 
operating income, as well as timing of certain payments and strategic inventory management as part of working capital 
initiatives, partially offset by payment of the remaining accrued opioid legal charges. The increase in net cash provided by 
operating activities for fiscal 2023, when compared to the previous fiscal year, was primarily due to moderated levels of 
inventory purchases, partially offset by a decline in operating income and the timing of certain payments. 
Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Deficit 
Cash and cash equivalents were $9.9 billion and $8.6 billion as of January 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our working 
capital deficit, defined as total current assets less total current liabilities, was $15.5 billion and $16.5 billion as of January 31, 
2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in our working capital deficit is primarily driven by a decrease in accrued liabilities 
primarily due to the payment of the remaining accrued opioid legal charges and an increase in cash, partially offset by an 
increase in accounts payable and a decrease in inventories as part of working capital initiatives. We generally operate with a 
working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns 
provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases. 
We use intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is 
needed with the minimum cost possible. Additionally, from time-to-time, we repatriate earnings and related cash from 
jurisdictions outside of the U.S. Under current law, repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of U.S. federal tax, 
but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes. We do not expect current local laws, or other existing limitations 
on anticipated future repatriations of cash amounts held outside the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, 
financial position or results of operations.
As of January 31, 2024 and 2023, cash and cash equivalents of $3.5 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, may not be freely 
transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions or are subject to the approval of the noncontrolling interest 
shareholders.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
 
Fiscal Years Ended January 31,
(Amounts in millions)

Net cash used in investing activities
(21,287) 
(17,722) 
(6,015) 
Net cash used in investing activities was $21.3 billion, $17.7 billion and $6.0 billion for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, 
respectively, and generally consisted of capital expenditures. Net cash used in investing activities increased $3.6 billion for 
fiscal 2024 when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily due to increased payments for property and equipment. Net 
cash used in investing activities increased $11.7 billion for fiscal 2023 when compared to the previous fiscal year, primarily due 
to the result of lapping the net proceeds received from the divestitures of our operations in the U.K. and Japan and an increase 
in capital expenditures to support our investment strategy. 
Capital expenditures
Refer to the "Strategic Capital Allocation" section in our Company Performance Metrics for capital expenditure detail for fiscal 
2024 and 2023. For the fiscal year ending January 31, 2025 ("fiscal 2025"), we project capital expenditures will be 
approximately $20 billion to $24 billion, with a focus on technology, supply chain, and customer-facing initiatives.
Net Cash Used in Financing Activities
 
Fiscal Years Ended January 31,
(Amounts in millions)

Net cash used in financing activities
(13,414) 
(17,039) 
(22,828) 
Net cash from financing activities generally consists of debt transactions, dividends paid, repurchases of Company stock and 
transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders. Fiscal 2024 net cash used in financing activities decreased $3.6 billion 
when compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease is primarily due to fewer repurchases of Company stock, partially 
offset by the purchase of certain noncontrolling interests. Fiscal 2023 net cash used in financing activities decreased $5.8 
billion when compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to repayments of long-term debt and related 
payment of premiums for the early extinguishment of certain notes in the prior fiscal year, partially offset by the equity funding 
from the sale of subsidiary stock in the prior fiscal year.
Purchase and Sale of Subsidiary Stock
During fiscal 2024, we paid $3.5 billion to acquire shares from certain Flipkart noncontrolling interest holders and settle the 
liability to former noncontrolling interest holders of PhonePe. Additionally, we received $0.7 billion related to new rounds of 
equity funding for the Company's majority owned PhonePe subsidiary.
During fiscal 2023, we completed a $0.4 billion buyout of the noncontrolling interest shareholders of our Massmart subsidiary 
and completed a $0.4 billion acquisition of Alert Innovation, bringing our ownership to approximately 100% of both Massmart 
and Alert Innovation.
During fiscal 2022, we received $3.2 billion primarily related to a new equity funding for our majority-owned Flipkart 
subsidiary.
Short-term Borrowings
We generally utilize the liquidity provided by short-term borrowings to provide funding for our operations, dividend payments, 
share repurchases, capital expenditures and other cash requirements. The following table includes additional information related 
to the our short-term borrowings for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022:

Short-term borrowings as of January 31, 2024 and 2023 were $0.9 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively, with weighted-average 
interest rates of 7.7% and 6.6%, respectively. We also have $15.0 billion of various undrawn committed lines of credit in the 
U.S. as of January 31, 2024 that provide additional liquidity, if needed. Additionally, we maintain access to various credit 
facilities outside of the U.S. to further support our Walmart International segment operations, as needed. 
As of January 31, 2024, we have $2.1 billion of syndicated and fronted letters of credit available, of which $1.7 billion was 
drawn and represents an unrecorded current obligation.

Our total outstanding long-term debt increased $0.7 billion during fiscal 2024, primarily due to the issuance of new long-term 
debt in April 2023, partially offset by the maturities of certain long-term debt. Refer to Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial 
Statements for details on the issuances of long-term debt.
Estimated contractual interest payments associated with our long-term debt amount to $20.2 billion, with approximately $1.8 
billion expected to be paid in fiscal 2025. Estimated interest payments are based on our principal amounts and expected 
maturities of all debt outstanding as of January 31, 2024, and assumes interest rates remain at current levels for our variable rate 
instruments. 
Dividends
Our total dividend payments were $6.1 billion, $6.1 billion and $6.2 billion for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
Effective February 20, 2024, the Company approved the fiscal 2025 annual dividend of $0.83 per share, an increase over the 
fiscal 2024 annual dividend of $0.76 per share. For fiscal 2025, the annual dividend will be paid in four quarterly installments 
of $0.2075 per share, according to the following record and payable dates:

Company Share Repurchase Program 
From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the 
Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during fiscal 2024 were made under the current $20.0 billion share 
repurchase program approved in November 2022, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over 
which the Company can make repurchases. As of January 31, 2024, authorization for $16.5 billion of share repurchases 
remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued 
status. 
We regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, 
including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the 
market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded 
through the Company's free cash flow. 
The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share and 
total amount paid for share repurchases for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022:

Material Cash Requirements
Material cash requirements from operating activities primarily consist of inventory purchases, employee related costs, taxes, 
interest and other general operating expenses, which we expect to be primarily satisfied by our cash from operations. Other 
material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations include short-term borrowings, long-term debt and 
related interest payments, leases and purchase obligations. See Note 6 and Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for 
information regarding outstanding short-term borrowings and long-term debt, and leases, respectively.
As of January 31, 2024, the Company has $34.3 billion of unrecorded purchase obligations outstanding, of which $14.6 billion 
is due within one year. Purchase obligations include legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory and 

utility purchases, as well as commitments to make capital expenditures, software acquisition and license commitments and 
legally binding service contracts. Contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that 
are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be 
purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Contracts that specify 
the Company will purchase all or a portion of its requirements of a specific product or service from a supplier, but do not 
include a fixed or minimum quantity, are excluded from the obligations quantified above. Accordingly, purchase orders for 
inventory are also excluded as purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our 
purchase orders are based on our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods. We also 
enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts 
generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid 
may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some 
obligations.
Capital Resources
We believe our cash flows from operations, current cash position, short-term borrowings and access to capital markets will 
continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements and contractual obligations, which includes funding seasonal 
buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share 
repurchases.
We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance 
our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets. As of January 31, 2024, the ratings assigned to our commercial 
paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows:
Rating agency
 
Commercial paper
 
Long-term debt
Standard & Poor's
 
A-1+
 
Moody's Investors Service
 
P-1
 
Aa2
Fitch Ratings
 
F1+
 
Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be 
subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent 
over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic 
environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in 
our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs 
or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade 
of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility 
that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. 
The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each 
rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated 
independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.
Other Matters
In Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned "Contingencies" and appears in Part II of this Annual 
Report on Form 10-K under the caption "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," we discuss, under the subcaptions "Settlement Framework Regarding Multidistrict and State or Local Opioid Related Litigation," and "Other Opioid 
Related Litigation" the Prescription Opiate Litigation, the Settlement Framework, and other matters, including certain risks 
arising therefrom. In that Note 10, we also discuss under the sub-caption "Asda Equal Value Claims" the Company's 
indemnification obligation for the Asda Equal Value Claims matter, under the sub-caption "Money Transfer Agent Services 
Matters," a United States Federal Trade Commission complaint related to money transfers and the Company's anti-fraud 
program and a government investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania into the 
Company's consumer fraud prevention and anti-money laundering compliance related to the Company's money transfer agent 
services as well as under the sub-caption "Mexico Antitrust Matter," we disclose the main Mexican operating subsidiary of WalMart de México was notified of the initiation of a quasi-judicial administrative process against it for alleged relative 
monopolistic practices in connection with the supply and wholesale distribution of certain consumer goods, retail marketing 
practices of such consumer goods and related services. We discuss various legal proceedings related to the Federal and State 
Prescription Opiate Litigation, the Settlement Framework, DOJ Opioid Civil Litigation and Opioids Related Securities Class 
Actions and Derivative Litigation in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption "Item 3. Legal Proceedings," 
under the sub-caption "I. Supplemental Information." We also discuss the Foreign Direct Investment Matters in Part I of this 
Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption "Item 3. Legal Proceedings," under the sub-caption "II. Certain Other Matters." 
We also discuss an environmental matter with the State of California in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the 
caption "Item 3. Legal Proceedings," under the sub-caption "III. Environmental Matters." The foregoing matters and other 

matters described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K represent contingent liabilities of the Company that may or 
may not result in the incurrence of a material liability by the Company upon their final resolution.
Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates
Management strives to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner, although in some cases accounting and 
disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology. In preparing the Company's Consolidated Financial 
Statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. These principles require us to make certain 
estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements. 
These judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes. Actual results may differ from 
our estimates.
Management continually reviews our accounting policies including how they are applied and how they are reported and 
disclosed in our financial statements. Following is a summary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in 
preparation of the financial statements.
Contingencies
We are involved in a number of legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters. We record a liability when it is probable that a 
loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. We also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss 
contingencies where a loss is either reasonably possible or it is reasonably possible that a loss could be incurred in excess of 
amounts accrued. If a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial 
statements would be material, we provide disclosure of the loss contingency in the footnotes to our financial statements. We 
review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a 
reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made. Although we are not able to predict the outcome or 
reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in certain matters described in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements 
and have not recorded an associated accrual related to these matters, an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of 
these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash 
flows.
Uncertain Tax Positions
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our tax returns are routinely audited and 
settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are 
recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions 
will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities 
and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. We account for uncertain tax positions by determining the 
minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. 
Accordingly, the determination of our uncertain tax positions requires judgment, the use of estimates in certain cases and the 
interpretation and application of complex tax laws.
ITEM 7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Market Risk
In addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks, including changes in interest rates, 
currency exchange rates and the fair values of certain equity and equity method investments measured on a recurring basis.
The analysis presented below for each of our market risk sensitive instruments is based on a hypothetical scenario used to 
calibrate potential risk and does not represent our view of future market changes. The effect of a change in a particular 
assumption is calculated without adjusting any other assumption. In reality, however, a change in one factor could cause a 
change in another, which may magnify or negate other sensitivities.
Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our short-term borrowings and long-term debt. We hedge a portion of 
our interest rate risk by managing the mix of fixed and variable rate debt and by entering into interest rate swaps. For fiscal 
2024, the net fair value of our interest rate swaps increased $35 million primarily due to fluctuations in market interest rates. 

The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For longterm debt, the table represents the principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. 
For interest rate swaps, the table represents the contractual cash flows and weighted-average interest rates by the contractual 
maturity date, unless otherwise noted. The notional amounts are used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged under 
the contracts. The weighted-average variable rates are based upon prevailing market rates as of January 31, 2024.

Includes deferred loan costs, discounts, fair value hedges, foreign-held debt and secured debt. 
As of January 31, 2024, our variable rate borrowings, including the effect of our commercial paper and interest rate swaps, 
represented 18% of our total short-term and long-term debt. Based on January 31, 2024 debt levels, a 100 basis point change in 
prevailing market rates would cause our annual interest costs to change by approximately $0.1 billion.
Foreign Currency Risk
We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our investments and operations in countries other than 
the U.S., as well as our foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt. For fiscal 2024, movements in currency exchange rates 
and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheets resulted in the $0.3 billion net gain in the currency translation and 
other category of accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
We hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by entering into currency swaps. The aggregate fair value of these swaps was 
in a liability position of $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion as of January 31, 2024 and January 31, 2023, respectively. The change in 
the fair value of these swaps was due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, primarily due to the strengthening of certain 
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar in fiscal 2024. The hypothetical result of a uniform 10% weakening in the value of the 
U.S. dollar relative to other currencies underlying these swaps would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of $0.7 
billion. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates underlying these swaps from the market rates in effect as of January 31, 
2024 would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of $0.1 billion.
In certain countries, we also enter into immaterial foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase and payment of 
purchase commitments denominated in non-functional currencies.
Investment Risk
We are exposed to investment risk primarily related to changes in the fair value of certain equity investments, including certain 
immaterial equity method investments where we have elected the fair value option, measured on a recurring basis. The 
amounts of gains and losses included in earnings from fair value changes for these investments are recorded within other gains 
and losses and resulted in a net loss of $3.8 billion in fiscal 2024 primarily due to net decreases in the underlying stock prices of 
these investments. As of January 31, 2024, the fair value of our equity investments, including certain equity method 
investments, measured on a recurring basis was $7.2 billion. As of January 31, 2024, a hypothetical 10% change in the stock 
price of such investments would have changed the fair value of such investments by approximately $0.7 billion.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Walmart Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Walmart Inc. (the Company) as of January 31, 2024 and 
2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the 
three years in the period ended January 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "Consolidated Financial 
Statements"). In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial 
position of the Company at January 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three 
years in the period ended January 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) 
(PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 
(2013 framework) and our report dated March 15, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion 
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on 
the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are 
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable 
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the 
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to 
error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included 
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included 
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that 
was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that 
are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The 
communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements, 
taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical 
audit matter or on the account or disclosures to which it relates.
Contingencies
Description of 
the Matter
As described in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, at January 31, 2024, the Company is 
involved in a number of legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters. The Company records a 
liability for those legal proceedings and regulatory matters when management determines it is probable 
that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company also 
discloses when it is reasonably possible that a material loss may be incurred. In assessing the probability 
of occurrence and whether an estimate of loss can be reasonably estimated for a particular legal 
proceeding, management exercises judgment on matters relevant to each proceeding. Auditing 
management's accounting for, and disclosure of, loss contingencies was complex and highly judgmental 
as it involved our assessment of the significant judgments made by management when assessing the 
probability of loss for contingencies or when determining whether an estimate of the loss or range of loss 
could be made. 

How We 
Addressed the 
Matter in Our 
Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls 
over the identification and evaluation of contingencies. For example, we tested controls over the 
Company's assessment of the likelihood of loss and the Company's determinations regarding the 
measurement of loss. 
To test the Company's assessment of the probability of loss or determination of an estimate of loss, or 
range of loss, among other procedures, we read the minutes of the meetings of the board of directors and 
committees of the board of directors, reviewed documents provided to the Company by certain outside 
legal counsel, read letters received directly by us from internal and outside legal counsel, evaluated the 
current status of contingencies based on discussions with internal and outside legal counsel, and obtained 
representations from management. We also assessed the adequacy of the related disclosures.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Walmart Inc. 
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
We have audited Walmart Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 
(2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Walmart Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, 
effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) 
(PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of January 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated 
statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period 
ended January 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated March 15, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion 
The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its 
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report on Internal 
Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial 
reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent 
with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the 
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all 
material respects. 
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material 
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and 
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a 
reasonable basis for our opinion. 
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures 
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and 
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the 
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate 
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
General

people around the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere – by providing the opportunity to shop in both 
retail stores and through eCommerce. Through innovation, the Company is striving to continuously improve a customer-centric 
experience that seamlessly integrates eCommerce and retail stores in an omni-channel offering that saves time for its customers. 
The Company's operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.
Principles of Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Walmart and its subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years ended 
January 31, 2024 ("fiscal 2024"), January 31, 2023 ("fiscal 2023") and January 31, 2022 ("fiscal 2022"). Intercompany 
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company consolidates variable interest entities where it 
has been determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of those entities' operations. Investments in common stock or 
in-substance common stock for which the Company exercises significant influence but does not have control are accounted for 
under the equity method. These variable interest entities and equity method investments are immaterial to the Company's 
Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending on January 31 for the United States 
("U.S.") and Canadian operations. The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag and based 
on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during the month of January 2024 related to the operations 
consolidated using a lag that materially affected the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Use of Estimates
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles 
("GAAP"). Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets 
and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date 
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may 
differ from those estimates.
Common Stock Split
On February 23, 2024, the Company effected a 3-for-1 forward split of its common stock and a proportionate increase in the 
number of authorized shares. All share and per share information, including share based compensation, throughout this Annual 
Report on Form 10-K has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. The shares of common stock retain a par value of 
$0.10 per share. Accordingly, an amount equal to the par value of the increased shares resulting from the stock split was 
reclassified from capital in excess of par value to common stock.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers investments with a maturity when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents. All credit 
card, debit card and electronic transfer transactions that process in less than seven days are classified as cash and cash 
equivalents. The amounts due from banks for these transactions classified as cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.1 billion and 
$2.0 billion as of January 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
The Company's cash balances are held in various locations around the world. Of the Company's $9.9 billion and $8.6 billion in 
cash and cash equivalents as of January 31, 2024 and January 31, 2023, approximately 60% and 62% were held outside of the 
U.S., respectively. Cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. are generally utilized to support liquidity needs in the 
Company's non-U.S. operations.
The Company uses intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in 
which it is needed with the minimum cost possible. 
As of January 31, 2024 and 2023, cash and cash equivalents of approximately $3.5 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, may 
not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws, other restrictions or are subject to the approval of the noncontrolling 
interest shareholders.

Receivables
Receivables are stated at their carrying values, net of a reserve for doubtful accounts, and are primarily due from the following: 
customers, which includes pharmacy insurance companies as well as advertisers, and banks for customer credit, debit cards and 
electronic transfer transactions that take in excess of seven days to process; suppliers for marketing or incentive programs; 
governments for income taxes; and real estate transactions. Net receivables from transactions with customers were $3.7 billion 
as of January 31, 2024 and January 31, 2023.
Inventories
The Company utilizes various inventory methods to account for and value its inventories depending upon the nature of the store 
formats and businesses in each of its segments, resulting in inventories that are recorded at the lower of cost or market or net 
realizable value, as appropriate. 
Walmart U.S. Segment - Inventories are primarily accounted for under the retail inventory method of accounting 
("RIM") to determine inventory cost, using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") valuation method. RIM generally results in 
inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market as permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a 
reduction of the retail value of inventory.
Walmart International Segment – Depending on the store format in each market, inventories are generally accounted 
for using either the RIM or weighted-average cost method, using the first-in, first-out valuation method. 
Sam's Club Segment - The majority of this segment's inventory is accounted for and valued using the weightedaverage cost LIFO method.
For those segments that utilize the LIFO method, the Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the 
projected annual effect of inflation or deflation. These estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end for 
inflation or deflation and inventory levels. 
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Gains or losses on disposition are recognized as earned or incurred. 
Costs of major improvements are capitalized, while costs of normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The 
following table summarizes the Company's property and equipment balances and includes the estimated useful lives that are 
generally used to depreciate the assets on a straight-line basis:

and intangible assets for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $11.9 billion, $10.9 billion and $10.7 billion, respectively.
Leases
For any new or modified lease, the Company, at the inception of the contract, determines whether a contract is or contains a 
lease. The Company records right-of-use ("ROU") assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases, which are 
initially recognized based on the discounted future lease payments over the term of the lease. If the rate implicit in the 
Company's leases is not readily determinable, the Company's applicable incremental borrowing rate is used in calculating the 
present value of the sum of the lease payments.
Lease term is defined as the non-cancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend or terminate the lease when it is 
reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. The Company has elected not to recognize ROU asset and lease 
obligations for its short-term leases, which are defined as leases with an initial term of 12 months or less.
For a majority of all classes of underlying assets, the Company has elected to not separate lease from non-lease components. 
For leases in which the lease and non-lease components have been combined, the variable lease expense includes expenses such 
as common area maintenance, utilities and repairs and maintenance.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Management reviews long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which 
is at the individual store or club level. Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated 
over the assets' useful lives based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may 
not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as 
determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique. 
Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets 
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is 
allocated to the appropriate reporting unit when acquired. Other acquired intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired 
as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended use of the related asset. Goodwill and indefinite-lived 
intangible assets are not amortized; rather, they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired. Definite-lived intangible assets are considered long-lived 
assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided.
Goodwill is typically assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition. Components within the same reportable 
segment are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. As of 
January 31, 2024, the Company's reporting units consisted of Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Goodwill 
and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are evaluated for impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative 
approach for each of the Company's reporting units. Generally, a qualitative assessment is first performed to determine whether 
a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary. If management determines, after performing an assessment based on the 
qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair 
value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative goodwill 
impairment test would be required. The quantitative test for goodwill impairment is performed by determining the fair value of 
the related reporting units. Fair value is measured based on the discounted cash flow method and relative market-based 
approaches. Management has performed its evaluation and determined the fair value of each reporting unit is significantly 
greater than the carrying amount and, accordingly, the Company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill 
during fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2022.
The following table reflects goodwill activity, by reportable segment, for fiscal 2024 and 2023:

Intangible assets are recorded in other long-term assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of January 31, 2024 
and 2023, the Company had $4.1 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, in indefinite-lived intangible assets which primarily 
consists of acquired trade names. There were no significant impairment charges related to intangible assets for fiscal 2024, 
2023 or 2022. 
Fair Value Measurement
The Company records and discloses certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The fair value of an 
asset is the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated, knowledgeable and willing parties 
able to engage in the transaction. The fair value of a liability is the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new 
obligor in a transaction between such parties, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Refer to 
Note 8 for more information. 
Investments
Investments in equity securities are recorded in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair 
value of certain equity securities, as well as certain immaterial equity method investments where the Company has elected the 
fair value option, are measured on a recurring basis and recognized within other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements 
of Income. These fair value changes, along with certain other immaterial investment activity, resulted in net losses of $3.8 
billion, $1.7 billion and $2.4 billion for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, primarily due to net changes in the underlying 
stock prices of those investments. Refer to Note 8 for details. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are 

carried at cost and adjusted for any observable price changes or impairments within other gains and losses in the Consolidated 
Statements of Income. 
Investments in debt securities classified as trading are reported at fair value and adjustments in fair value are recorded within 
other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of January 31, 2024 and January 31, 2023, the Company 
had $1.2 billion and $0.5 billion, respectively, in debt securities classified as trading.
Indemnification Liabilities
The Company has provided certain indemnifications in connection with its divestitures and has recorded indemnification 
liabilities equal to the estimated fair value of the obligations upon inception. As of January 31, 2024 and January 31, 2023, the 
Company had $0.7 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively, of certain legal indemnification liabilities recorded within deferred 
income taxes and other in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The maximum of potential future payments under these 
indemnities was $3.2 billion, based on exchange rates as of January 31, 2024. 
Supplier Financing Program Obligations
In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of 
Supplier Finance Program Obligations, which enhances the transparency about the use of supplier finance programs for 
investors and other allocators of capital. The Company adopted this ASU as of February 1, 2023, other than the roll-forward 
disclosure requirement, which the Company will adopt in fiscal 2025.
The Company has supplier financing programs with financial institutions, in which the Company agrees to pay the financial 
institution the stated amount of confirmed invoices on the invoice due date for participating suppliers. Participation in these 
programs is optional and solely up to the supplier, who negotiates the terms of the arrangement directly with the financial 
institution and may allow early payment. Supplier participation in these programs has no bearing on the Company's amounts 
due. The payment terms that the Company has with participating suppliers under these programs generally range between 30 
and 90 days. The Company does not have an economic interest in a supplier's participation in the program or a direct financial 
relationship with the financial institution funding the program. The Company is responsible for ensuring that participating 
financial institutions are paid according to the terms negotiated with the supplier, regardless of whether the supplier elects to 
receive early payment from the financial institution. The outstanding payment obligations to financial institutions under these 
programs were $5.3 billion and $5.2 billion, as of January 31, 2024 and January 31, 2023, respectively. These obligations are 
generally classified as accounts payable within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The activity related to these programs is 
classified as an operating activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Self Insurance Reserves
The Company self-insures a number of risks, including, but not limited to, workers' compensation, general liability, auto 
liability, product liability and certain employee-related healthcare benefits. Standard actuarial procedures and data analysis are 
used to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks on an undiscounted basis. The recorded liabilities reflect the ultimate 
cost for claims incurred but not paid and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these 
outstanding claim payments. On a regular basis, the liabilities are evaluated for appropriateness with claims reserve valuations. 
To limit exposure to some risks, the Company maintains insurance coverage with varying limits and retentions, including stoploss insurance coverage for workers' compensation, general liability and auto liability.
Derivatives
The Company uses derivatives for hedging purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and currency exchange rates, 
as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed- and variable-rate debt. Use of derivatives in hedging programs subjects the 
Company to certain risks, such as market and credit risks. The Company may be exposed to credit-related losses in the event of 
nonperformance by its counterparties to derivatives. Credit risk is monitored through established approval procedures, 
including setting concentration limits by counterparty, reviewing credit ratings and requiring collateral from the counterparty. 
The Company enters into derivatives with counterparties rated generally "A-" or better by nationally recognized credit rating 
agencies. The Company is subject to master netting arrangements which provides set-off and close-out netting of exposures 
with counterparties, but the Company does not offset derivative assets and liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The 
Company's collateral arrangements require the counterparty in a net liability position in excess of pre-determined thresholds, 
after considering the effects of netting arrangements, to pledge cash collateral. Cash collateral received from counterparties and 
cash collateral provided to counterparties under these arrangements was not significant as of January 31, 2024 and 2023.

In order to qualify for hedge accounting, at the inception of the hedging relationship, the Company formally documents its risk 
management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction, as well as its designation of the hedge. If a 
derivative is recorded using hedge accounting, depending on the nature of the hedge, derivative gains and losses are recorded 
through the same financial statement line item in earnings or are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the 
hedged item is recognized in earnings. Derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, or contracts for which the 
Company has not elected hedge accounting, are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings. 
Derivatives with an unrealized gain are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as either current or non-current 
assets, based on maturity date, and derivatives with an unrealized loss are recorded as either current or non-current liabilities, 
based on maturity date. Refer to Note 8 for the presentation of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities. 
Fair Value Hedges
The Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge the fair value 
of fixed-rate debt. All interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of the related long-term debt meet the shortcut 
method requirements under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, changes in the fair values of these interest rate swaps are considered to 
exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt. These derivatives will mature on dates ranging from 
April 2024 to September 2031.
Cash Flow Hedges
The Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross currency interest rate swaps used to hedge the currency 
exposure associated with the forecasted payments of principal and interest of certain non-U.S. denominated debt. The 
Company records changes in the fair value of these swaps in accumulated other comprehensive loss which is subsequently 
reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. These derivatives will mature on 
dates ranging from July 2024 to January 2039.
Net Investment Hedges
Prior to the divestiture of the Company's operations in the United Kingdom and Japan as discussed in Note 12, the Company 
was a party to receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross currency interest rate swaps used to hedge the currency exposure 
associated with net investments of these foreign operations. Changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk were recorded 
in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company also previously designated certain foreign currency denominated 
long-term debt as a hedge of currency exposure associated with the net investment of these divested operations and recorded 
foreign currency gain or loss associated with designated long-term debt in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Upon 
closing of the sale of the Company's operations in the U.K. and Japan during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, these amounts were 
released from accumulated other comprehensive loss as discussed in Note 4. 
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the balance sheet method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the 
estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing 
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases ("temporary differences"). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured 
using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The 
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the 
enactment date.
Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not 
more likely than not to be realized. Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the 
deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward 
periods, and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by 
assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, 
forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely on estimates.
In determining the provision for income taxes, an annual effective income tax rate is used based on annual income, permanent 
differences between book and tax income, and statutory income tax rates. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes 
in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.
The Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be 
taken in a tax return. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and 
operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. 
Refer to Note 9 for additional income tax disclosures.

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest
Noncontrolling interests that are redeemable outside the Company's control at fixed or determinable prices and dates are 
presented as temporary equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Redeemable noncontrolling interests are recorded at the 
greater of the redemption fair value or the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest and adjusted each reporting period for 
income, loss and any distributions made. Remeasurements to the redemption value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest are 
recognized in capital in excess of par. As of January 31, 2024, the Company has a redeemable noncontrolling interest related to 
an acquisition in the Walmart U.S. segment as the minority interest owner holds a put option which may require the Company 
to purchase its interest beginning in December 2027, with annual options thereafter.
Revenue Recognition
Net Sales
The Company recognizes sales revenue, net of sales taxes and estimated sales returns, at the time it sells merchandise or 
services to the customer. eCommerce sales include shipping revenue and are recorded upon delivery to the customer. 
Estimated sales returns are calculated based on expected returns.
Membership Fee Revenue
The Company recognizes membership fee revenue over the term of the membership, which is typically 12 months. 
Membership fee revenue was $3.1 billion for fiscal 2024, $2.6 billion for fiscal 2023 and $2.2 billion for fiscal 2022. 
Membership fee revenue is included in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. 
Deferred membership fee revenue is included in accrued liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Gift Cards
Customer purchases of gift cards are not recognized as sales until the card is redeemed and the customer purchases merchandise 
using the gift card. Gift cards in the U.S. and some countries do not carry an expiration date; therefore, customers and members 
can redeem their gift cards for merchandise and services indefinitely. Gift cards in some countries where the Company does 
business have expiration dates. While gift cards are generally redeemed within 12 months, a certain number of gift cards, both 
with and without expiration dates, will not be fully redeemed. Management estimates unredeemed balances and recognizes 
revenue for these amounts in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income over the 
expected redemption period. 
Financial, Advertising and Other Services
The Company recognizes revenue from service transactions at the time the service is performed. Generally, revenue from 
services is classified as a component of net sales in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales includes actual product cost, the cost of transportation to the Company's distribution facilities, stores and clubs 
from suppliers, the cost of transportation from the Company's distribution facilities to the stores, clubs and customers and the 
cost of warehousing for the Sam's Club segment and import distribution centers. Cost of sales is reduced by supplier payments 
that are not a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs.
Payments from Suppliers
The Company receives consideration from suppliers for various programs, primarily volume incentives, warehouse allowances 
and reimbursements for specific programs such as markdowns, margin protection, certain advertising arrangements and 
supplier-specific fixtures. Payments from suppliers are accounted for as a reduction of cost of sales and recognized in the 
Company's Consolidated Statements of Income when the related inventory is sold, except in certain limited situations when the 
payment is a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs.
Operating, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses include all operating costs of the Company, except cost of sales, as 
described above. As a result, the majority of the cost of warehousing and occupancy for the Walmart U.S. and Walmart 
International segments' distribution facilities is included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses. Because the 
Company only includes a portion of the cost of its Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities in 
cost of sales, its gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales may not be comparable to those of other retailers that 
may include all costs related to their distribution facilities in cost of sales and in the calculation of gross profit.

Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred, and consist primarily of digital, television and print advertisements that are recorded 
in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Advertising 
costs were $4.4 billion, $4.1 billion and $3.9 billion for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Currency Translation
The assets and liabilities of all international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currency to the U.S. dollar 
using exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Related translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated 
other comprehensive loss. The Company's Consolidated Statements of Income of all international subsidiaries are translated 
from the respective local currencies to the U.S. dollar using average exchange rates for the period covered by the income 
statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment 
Disclosures, which updates reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about 
significant segment expenses. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for 
interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments should 
be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Management is currently evaluating this 
ASU to determine its impact on the Company's disclosures.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, 
which expands the requirements for income tax disclosures in order to provide greater transparency. The amendments are 
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied 
prospectively. Management is currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on the Company's disclosures.
Note 2. Net Income Per Common Share
Basic net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding 
during the relevant period. Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average 
common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards. The Company did 
not have significant share-based awards outstanding that were antidilutive and not included in the calculation of diluted net 
income per common share attributable to Walmart for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022.
The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used to determine basic and diluted net 
income per common share attributable to Walmart:

Note 3. Shareholders' Equity
The total authorized shares of $0.10 par value common stock is 33.0 billion, of which 8.1 billion were issued and outstanding as 
of January 31, 2024 and 2023. The total authorized shares of $0.10 par value preferred stock is 0.1 billion; none of which were 
issued or outstanding for any period presented. 
Purchases and Sales of Subsidiary Stock
During fiscal 2024, the Company paid $3.5 billion to acquire shares from certain Flipkart noncontrolling interest holders and 
settle the liability to former noncontrolling interest holders of PhonePe. The Company's ownership of Flipkart increased from 
approximately 75% as of January 31, 2023 to approximately 85% as of January 31, 2024.
Also during fiscal 2024, the Company received $0.7 billion related to new rounds of equity funding for the Company's majority 
owned PhonePe subsidiary, which decreased the Company's ownership from approximately 89% as of January 31, 2023 to 
approximately 84% as of January 31, 2024.
During fiscal 2023, the Company completed a $0.4 billion buyout of the noncontrolling interest shareholders of the Company's 
Massmart subsidiary. This transaction increased the Company's ownership in Massmart from approximately 53% to 100%. 
Additionally, the Company completed a $0.4 billion acquisition of Alert Innovation, which was previously consolidated as a 
variable interest entity, and resulted in the Company becoming a 100% owner.
Also during fiscal 2023, the Company increased its ownership in PhonePe from approximately 76% to approximately 89% as 
part of the separation from the Company's majority-owned Flipkart subsidiary. In consideration for the transaction, the 
Company initially recorded a liability to noncontrolling interest holders of $0.9 billion within accrued liabilities in the 
Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2023, which was paid during fiscal 2024.
During fiscal 2022, the Company received $3.2 billion primarily related to a new equity funding for the Company's majorityowned Flipkart subsidiary, which reduced the Company's ownership from approximately 83% as of January 31, 2021 to 
approximately 75% as of January 31, 2022.
Share-Based Compensation
The Company has awarded share-based compensation to associates and nonemployee directors of the Company. The 
compensation expense recognized for all stock incentive plans, including expense associated with plans of the Company's 
consolidated subsidiaries granted in the subsidiaries' respective stock, was $2.1 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.2 billion for fiscal 
2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Share-based compensation expense is generally included in operating, selling, general and 
administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The total income tax benefit recognized for 
share-based compensation was $0.5 billion, $0.4 billion and $0.3 billion for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The 
following table summarizes the Company's share-based compensation expense by award type for all plans:

The Walmart Inc. Stock Incentive Plan of 2015 (the "Plan"), as subsequently amended and restated, was established to grant 
stock options, restricted (non-vested) stock, restricted stock units, performance share units and other equity compensation 
awards for which 780 million shares of Walmart common stock issued or to be issued under the Plan have been registered 
under the Securities Act of 1933. The Company believes that such awards serve to align the interests of its associates with 
those of its shareholders.
The Plan's award types are summarized as follows:
Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units provide rights to Company stock after a specified service period. 
Beginning in fiscal 2023, restricted stock units generally vest at a rate of approximately 8% each quarter over a three 
year period from the date of grant. For grants made from fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2022, restricted stock units 
generally vest at a rate of 25% each year over a four year period from the date of the grant. Prior to fiscal 2020, 50% of 
restricted stock units generally vested three years from the grant date and the remaining 50% were vested five years 
from the grant date. The fair value of each restricted stock unit is determined on the date of grant using the stock price 
discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized ratably over the vesting period. 
The expected dividend yield is based on the anticipated dividends over the vesting period. The weighted-average 
discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of restricted stock units granted in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 
2022 was 2.2%, 2.3% and 3.8%, respectively.

Restricted Stock and Performance-based Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock awards are for shares that vest based 
on the passage of time and include restrictions related to employment. Performance-based restricted stock units vest 
based on the passage of time and achievement of performance criteria and generally range from 0% to 150% of the 
original award amount. Vesting periods for restricted stock are generally between one month and three years. Vesting 
periods for performance-based restricted stock units are generally between one and three years. Restricted stock and 
performance-based restricted stock units may be settled or deferred in stock and are accounted for as equity in the 
Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined on the date of grant 
and is expensed ratably over the vesting period. The fair value of performance-based restricted stock units is 
determined on the date of grant using the Company's stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the 
vesting period and is recognized over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to 
determine the fair value of performance-based restricted stock units in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 was 3.3%, 3.3% and 
4.2%, respectively.
In addition to the Plan, Flipkart and PhonePe have share-based compensation plans for associates under which options to 
acquire their own common shares may be issued. These plans may be subject to performance or other conditions, including 
vesting upon an initial public offering. Share-based compensation expense associated with certain of these plans is included in 
the Other line in the table above.

Share Repurchase Program
From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the 
Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during fiscal 2024 were made under the current $20.0 billion share 
repurchase program approved in November 2022, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over 
which the Company can make repurchases. As of January 31, 2024 authorization for $16.5 billion of share repurchases 
remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued 
status.
The Company regularly reviews share repurchase activity and considers several factors in determining when to execute share 
repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, results of operations 

and the market price of the Company's common stock. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of 
shares repurchased, average price paid per share and total amount paid for share repurchases for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022:

(1) Upon closing of the sale of the Company's operations in the U.K. and Japan during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, these amounts were released from 
accumulated other comprehensive loss, the majority of which was considered in the impairment evaluation when the individual disposal groups met the held 
for sale classification in fiscal 2021.
(2) Upon closing of the noncontrolling interest shareholder buyout of the Company's Massmart subsidiary during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the 
cumulative amount of currency translation was reallocated from the Company's noncontrolling interest back to the Company. Refer to Note 3.
Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss for derivative instruments are generally recorded in interest, 
net, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The amounts for the minimum pension liability, as well as the 
cumulative translation resulting from the disposition of a business, are recorded in other gains and losses in the Company's 
Consolidated Statements of Income. Amounts related to the Company's derivatives expected to be reclassified from 
accumulated other comprehensive loss to net income during the next 12 months are not significant.

Note 8. Fair Value Measurements
Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in 
measuring fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are:
Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and
Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop 
its own assumptions.
As described in Note 1, the Company measures the fair value of certain equity investments, including certain immaterial equity 
method investments where the Company has elected the fair value option, on a recurring basis within other long-term assets in 
the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amounts of gains and losses included in earnings from fair value changes 
for these investments are recognized within other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The fair value of 
these investments is as follows:
(Amounts in millions)
Fair Value as of 
January 31, 2024
Fair Value as of 
January 31, 2023
Equity investments measured using Level 1 inputs
2,835 
5,099 
Equity investments measured using Level 2 inputs
 
4,414 
 
5,570 
Total
7,249 
10,669 
Changes in the fair value of these investments were primarily due to gains and losses resulting from net changes in the 
underlying stock prices, along with certain other immaterial investment activity. The fair value of these investments decreased 
$3.4 billion and $1.2 billion during fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. Equity investments without readily determinable fair 

values are carried at cost and adjusted for any observable price changes or impairments within other gains and losses in the 
Consolidated Statements of Income.
Derivatives
The Company also has derivatives recorded at fair value. Derivative fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would 
receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates. The fair values have been 
measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant interest rate and foreign currency forward 
curves. As of January 31, 2024 and January 31, 2023, the notional amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows:

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements
In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are 
also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a 
result of impairment charges. 
Upon completing the sales of the Company's operations in the U.K. in February 2021 and Japan in March 2021, the Company 
recorded incremental non-recurring impairment charges of $0.4 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 within other gains and 
losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 12. The Company did not have any material assets or liabilities 
resulting in nonrecurring fair value measurements as of January 31, 2024 and January 31, 2023. 
Other Fair Value Disclosures
The Company records cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term borrowings at cost. The carrying values of 
these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities.
The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the 
Company's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The carrying value and fair value 
of the Company's long-term debt as of January 31, 2024 and 2023, are as follows:

Unremitted Earnings
Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act"), the Company asserted that all unremitted earnings of its foreign 
subsidiaries were considered indefinitely reinvested. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company reported and paid U.S. tax on the 
majority of its previously unremitted foreign earnings, and repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of U.S. 
federal tax, but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes. As of January 31, 2024, the Company has not 
recorded approximately $1 billion of deferred tax liabilities associated with remaining unremitted foreign earnings considered 
indefinitely reinvested, for which U.S. and foreign income and withholding taxes would be due upon repatriation.
Net Operating Losses, Tax Credit Carryforwards and Valuation Allowances
As of January 31, 2024, the Company's net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards totaled approximately $30.3 billion. 
Of these carryforwards, approximately $16.5 billion will expire, if not utilized, in various years through 2044. The remaining 
carryforwards have no expiration. 
The realizability of these future tax deductions and credits is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable 
income from all sources, including taxable income in prior carryback years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, 
forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. To the extent the Company does not consider it more likely 
than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is generally established. To the extent that a 
valuation allowance was established and it is subsequently determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets 
will be recovered, the change in the valuation allowance is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
The Company had valuation allowances of approximately $7.5 billion and $7.8 billion as of January 31, 2024 and 2023, 
respectively, on deferred tax assets associated primarily with the net operating loss carryforwards. Activity in the valuation 
allowance during fiscal 2024 related to valuation allowance builds in multiple markets, as well as releases due to the expiration 
of unrealized deferred tax assets.
Uncertain Tax Positions
The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements only after determining 
a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities.
As of January 31, 2024 and 2023, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits related to continuing operations was $3.5 
billion and $3.3 billion, respectively. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the Company's effective 
income tax rate was $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion as of January 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
A reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits from continuing operations is as follows:

general and administrative expenses, respectively. Interest expense and penalties related to these positions were immaterial for 
fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022. During the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce 
unrecognized tax benefits by an immaterial amount, either because the tax positions are sustained on audit or because the 
Company agrees to their disallowance. The Company does not expect any change to have a material impact to its Consolidated 
Financial Statements.

The Company remains subject to income tax examinations for its U.S. federal income taxes generally for fiscal 2018 through 
2023. The Company also remains subject to income tax examinations for international income taxes for fiscal 2013 through 
2023, and for U.S. state and local income taxes generally for the fiscal years ended 2017 through 2023. With few exceptions, 
the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, local or foreign examinations by tax authorities for years before fiscal 
2013.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to tax examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll and other non-income taxes. A number of 
these examinations are ongoing in various jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments and judgments 
from the respective taxing authorities in connection with these examinations. Unless otherwise indicated, the possible losses or 
range of possible losses associated with these matters are individually immaterial, but a group of related matters, if decided 
adversely to the Company, could result in a liability material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
Note 10. Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters. The Company records a liability for 
those legal proceedings and regulatory matters when it determines it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of 
the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company also discloses when it is reasonably possible that a material loss may be 
incurred. From time to time, the Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into 
settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders.
Unless stated otherwise, the matters discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company, individually or in the 
aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Settlement Framework Regarding Multidistrict and State or Local Opioid-Related Litigation 
During fiscal 2023, the Company accrued a liability for approximately $3.3 billion for the Settlement Framework (described 
below) and other previously agreed upon state and tribal settlements. The Settlement Framework includes no admission of 
wrongdoing or liability by the Company, and the Company continues to believe it has substantial factual and legal defenses to 
opioids-related litigation. As of January 31, 2024, substantially all of the original approximately $3.3 billion accrued liability 
for the Settlement Framework and other settlements have been paid.
In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a 
wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, 
individuals and third-party payers, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The 
consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the "MDL") and 
is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the 
cases included in the MDL.
On November 15, 2022, the Company announced it had agreed to financial amounts and payment terms to resolve substantially 
all opioids-related lawsuits filed against the Company by states, political subdivisions, and Native American tribes whether as 
part of the MDL (excluding, however, a single, two-county trial described further below) or in state court, as well as all 
potential claims that could be made against the Company by states, political subdivisions, and Native American tribes for up to 
approximately $3.1 billion (the "Settlement Amount"). The Settlement Amount includes amounts for remediation of alleged 
harms as well as attorneys' fees and costs and also includes some, but not all, amounts from previously agreed recent 
settlements by the Company. One settlement framework with corresponding conditions and participation thresholds applies for 
the states and political subdivisions, and another settlement framework with corresponding conditions and participation 
thresholds applies for the Native American tribes. Both settlement frameworks are referred to collectively as the "Settlement 
Framework."
The Settlement Framework, among other applicable conditions, provides that payments to states and political subdivisions are 
contingent upon the number of states and political subdivisions, including those states and political subdivisions who have not 
yet sued the Company, that agree to participate in the Settlement Framework or otherwise have their claims foreclosed within a 
prescribed deadline. On December 20, 2022, the Company announced that it had settlement agreements with all 50 states, 
including four states that previously settled with the Company, as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and three other 
U.S. territories (the "Settling States"), thus satisfying the initial threshold of required participation by Settling States. On 
August 22, 2023, the settlement administrator determined that a sufficient number of political subdivisions had agreed to 
participate in the Settlement Framework, which was a necessary condition for the Settlement Framework to become effective. 
The Settlement Framework became effective 15 days later, on September 6, 2023. The Company deposited the full portion of 
the Settlement Amount attributable to the Settling States on October 11, 2023. Although the settlement administrator has 
determined that sufficient number of political subdivisions have agreed to participate in the Settlement Framework, and thus the 

Settlement Framework was effective, eligible political subdivisions still have until July 15, 2025, to join the Settlement 
Framework. 
Other Opioid-Related Litigation 
The Company will continue to vigorously defend against any opioid-related litigation not covered or otherwise resolved by the 
Settlement Framework, including, but not limited to, each of the matters described below; any other actions filed by healthcare 
providers, individuals, and third-party payers; and any action filed by a political subdivision or Native American tribe that is not 
resolved by the Settlement Framework. Accordingly, the Company has not accrued a liability for these opioid-related litigation 
matters nor can the Company reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters. The Company 
can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of any of these matters and no assurance that its business, financial 
position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected.
Two-County Trial and MDL Bellwethers; Canada; and Other Litigation. The liability phase of a single, two-county trial in one 
of the MDL cases resulted in a jury verdict on November 23, 2021, finding in favor of the plaintiffs as to the liability of all 
defendants, including the Company. The abatement phase of the single, two-county trial resulted in a judgment on August 17, 
2022, that ordered all three defendants, including the Company, to pay an aggregate amount of approximately $0.7 billion over 
fifteen years, on a joint and several liability basis, and granted the plaintiffs injunctive relief. On September 7, 2022, the 
Company filed an appeal with the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The monetary aspect of the judgment is stayed pending 
appeal, and the injunctive aspect of the judgment went into effect on February 20, 2023. On September 11, 2023, the Sixth 
Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order of certifying certain questions in the appeal for review by the Supreme Court of Ohio. 
On November 29, 2023, the Supreme Court of Ohio accepted the request for certification, and the matter remains pending with 
the court.
The MDL designated five additional single-county cases as bellwethers to proceed through discovery; however, these five 
counties have elected to participate in the Settlement Framework and receive a portion of the Settlement Amount rather than go 
to trial. On October 25, 2023, the MDL designated four cases brought by third-party payers as bellwether cases to proceed 
through discovery. Additional bellwethers of cases brought by hospitals and other healthcare providers may be designated in 
the future.
Wal-Mart Canada Corp. and certain other subsidiaries of the Company have been named as defendants in two putative class 
action complaints filed in Canada related to dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids. These matters remain 
pending. 
Similar cases that name the Company also have been filed in state and federal courts by state, local, and tribal governments, 
healthcare providers, and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs in these cases and in the MDL are seeking compensatory and punitive 
damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information 
requests, and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution 
practices involving opioids.
DOJ Opioid Civil Litigation. On December 22, 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") filed a civil complaint in the 
U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the Company unlawfully dispensed controlled substances from its 
pharmacies and unlawfully distributed controlled substances to those pharmacies. The complaint alleges that this conduct 
resulted in violations of the Controlled Substances Act. The DOJ is seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief. The Company 
initially moved to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. After that motion was fully briefed, the DOJ filed an 
amended complaint on October 7, 2022. On November 7, 2022, the Company filed a partial motion to dismiss the amended 
complaint. The Court held a hearing on the partial motion to dismiss on January 18, 2024, and ordered the DOJ to file an 
amended complaint. The DOJ filed that amended complaint on February 1, 2024, and Walmart filed a partial motion to dismiss 
that complaint on February 6, 2024. On March 11, 2024, the Court granted in-part Walmart's motion by dismissing the entirety 
of the DOJ's claims related to distribution and dismissing the DOJ's claims arising under one of the DOJ's two dispensing 
liability theories. The DOJ's claims arising under its other dispensing liability theory remain pending.
Opioid-Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation. In addition, the Company is the subject of two securities 
class actions alleging violations of the federal securities laws regarding the Company's disclosures with respect to opioids, filed 
in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on January 20, 2021 and March 5, 2021, purportedly on behalf of a class 
of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016 through December 22, 2020. Those cases have been 
consolidated. On October 8, 2021, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated securities action. After the parties 
had fully briefed the motion to dismiss, on September 9, 2022, the Court entered an order permitting the plaintiffs to file an 
amended complaint, which was filed on October 14, 2022, and which revised the applicable putative class of investors to those 
who acquired Walmart stock from March 31, 2017, through December 22, 2020. On November 16, 2022, the defendants filed a 
motion to dismiss the amended complaint. That motion remains pending.
Derivative actions were also filed by two of the Company's shareholders in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware 
on February 9, 2021 and April 16, 2021, alleging breach of fiduciary duties against certain of its current and former directors 
with respect to oversight of the Company's distribution and dispensing of opioids and also alleging violations of the federal 

securities laws and other breaches of duty by certain current and former directors and officers in connection with the Company's 
opioids disclosures. Those cases have been stayed pending developments in other opioids litigation matters. On September 27, 
2021, three shareholders filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery alleging that certain members of the Board 
of Directors and certain former officers breached their fiduciary duties in failing to adequately oversee the Company's 
prescription opioids business. The defendants moved to dismiss and/or to stay proceedings on December 21, 2021, and the 
plaintiffs responded by filing an amended complaint on February 22, 2022. On April 20, 2022, the defendants moved to 
dismiss and/or to stay proceedings with respect to the amended complaint. In two orders issued on April 12 and 26, 2023, the 
Court of Chancery granted the defendants' motion to dismiss with respect to claims involving the Company's distribution 
practices and denied the remainder of the motion, including the Company's request to stay the litigation. On May 5, 2023, the 
Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") appointed an independent Special Litigation Committee (the "SLC") to investigate 
the allegations regarding certain current and former officers and directors named in the various derivative proceedings 
regarding oversight with respect to opioids. The Board has authorized the SLC to retain independent legal counsel and such 
other advisors as the SLC deems appropriate in carrying out its duties. The derivative matter pending in the Delaware Court of 
Chancery is stayed until the SLC completes its investigation.
Other Legal Proceedings 
Asda Equal Value Claims. Asda, formerly a subsidiary of the Company, was and still is a defendant in certain equal value 
claims that began in 2008 and are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester in the United Kingdom on behalf 
of current and former Asda store employees, as well as additional claims in the High Court of the United Kingdom (the "Asda 
Equal Value Claims"). Further claims may be asserted in the future. Subsequent to the divestiture of Asda in February 2021, 
the Company continues to oversee the conduct of the defense of these claims. While potential liability for these claims remains 
with Asda, the Company has agreed to provide indemnification with respect to certain of these claims up to a contractually 
determined amount. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate 
any loss or range of loss that may arise related to these proceedings. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to 
the scope and outcome of these matters.
Money Transfer Agent Services Matters. The Company has responded to grand jury subpoenas issued by the United States 
Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on behalf of the DOJ seeking documents regarding the Company's 
consumer fraud prevention program and anti-money laundering compliance related to the Company's money transfer services, 
where Walmart is an agent. The most recent subpoena was issued in August 2020. Walmart's responses to DOJ's subpoenas 
have been complete since 2021. The Company continues to cooperate with and provide information and documents voluntarily 
in response to supplemental requests from the DOJ. The Company has also responded to civil investigative demands from the 
United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") in connection with the FTC's investigation related to money transfers and 
the Company's anti-fraud program in its capacity as an agent. On June 28, 2022, the FTC filed a complaint against the 
Company in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that Walmart violated the Federal Trade 
Commission Act and the Telemarketing Sales Rule regarding its money transfer agent services and is requesting non-monetary 
relief and civil penalties. On August 29, 2022, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On March 27, 2023, the 
Court issued an opinion dismissing the FTC's claim under the Telemarketing Sales Rule and denying Walmart's motion to 
dismiss the claim under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. On April 12, 2023, Walmart filed a motion to certify 
the Court's March 27, 2023, order for interlocutory appeal. On June 30, 2023, the FTC filed an amended complaint against 
Walmart again asserting claims under the Federal Trade Commission Act and Telemarketing Sales Rule. On July 20, 2023, the 
Court denied Walmart's motion to certify the Court's March 27, 2023, order for interlocutory appeal, finding that it would be 
more orderly to consider a request for interlocutory appeal after a ruling on Walmart's motion to dismiss the amended 
complaint. Walmart's motion to dismiss the amended complaint was filed on August 11, 2023. The motion remains pending. 
No other deadlines have yet been set, and discovery is stayed. 
The Company intends to vigorously defend these matters. However, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and 
outcome of these matters and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise. Accordingly, the Company 
can provide no assurance that its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely 
affected. 
Mexico Antitrust Matter. On October 6, 2023, the Comisión Federal de Competencia Económica of México ("COFECE") 
notified the main Mexican operating subsidiary of Wal-Mart de México, S.A.B. de C.V. ("Walmex"), a majority owned 
subsidiary of the Company, that COFECE's Investigatory Authority ("IA") had requested COFECE to initiate a quasi-judicial 
administrative process against Walmex's subsidiary for alleged relative monopolistic practices in connection with the supply 
and wholesale distribution of certain consumer goods, retail marketing practices of such consumer goods and related services. 
The quasi-judicial administrative process is the first opportunity for Walmex's subsidiary to respond to and defend against the 
IA's allegations before COFECE. While COFECE has the authority to impose monetary relief and/or non-structural conduct 
measures, such relief and conduct measures would be subject to appeal by Walmex's subsidiary. On December 14, 2023, 
Walmex's subsidiary submitted its defense arguments and will continue to defend against the allegations vigorously, both at the 
quasi-judicial administrative process and, if required, before any courts. Because this process is at an early stage, the Company 
can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters, cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that 

may arise and can provide no assurance that its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be 
materially adversely affected.
Note 11. Retirement-Related Benefits
The Company offers a 401(k) plan for associates in the U.S. under which eligible associates can begin contributing to the plan 
immediately upon hire. The Company also offers a 401(k) type plan for associates in Puerto Rico under which associates can 
begin to contribute generally after one year of employment. Under these plans, after one year of employment, the Company 
matches 100% of participant contributions up to 6% of annual eligible earnings. The matching contributions immediately vest 
at 100% for each associate. Participants can contribute up to 50% of their pre-tax earnings, but not more than the statutory 
limits.
Associates in international countries who are not U.S. citizens are covered by various defined contribution post-employment 
benefit arrangements. These plans are administered based upon the legislative and tax requirements in the countries in which 
they are established.

Note 12. Disposals, Acquisitions and Related Items
The following dispositions impact the Company's Walmart International segment. Other immaterial transactions have also 
occurred. 
Asda
In February 2021, the Company completed the divestiture of Asda, the Company's retail operations in the U.K., for net 
consideration of $9.6 billion. Upon closing of the transaction, the Company recorded an incremental pre-tax loss of $0.2 billion 
in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statements of Income in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily related to 
changes in the net assets of the disposal group, currency exchange rate fluctuations and customary purchase price adjustments 
upon closing. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company deconsolidated the financial statements of Asda and 
recognized its retained investment in Asda as a debt security within other long-term assets and also recognized certain legal and 
tax indemnity liabilities within deferred income taxes and other in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Seiyu
In March 2021, the Company completed the divestiture of Seiyu, the Company's retail operations in Japan, for net consideration 
of $1.2 billion. Upon closing of the transaction, the Company recorded an incremental pre-tax loss of $0.2 billion in other gains 
and losses in its Consolidated Statements of Income in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily related to changes in the net 
assets of the disposal group, currency exchange rate fluctuations and customary purchase price adjustments upon closing. 
During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company deconsolidated the financial statements of Seiyu and recognized its 
retained 15 percent ownership interest in Seiyu as an equity investment within other long-term assets in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet.
Note 13. Segments and Disaggregated Revenue
Segments
The Company is engaged in the operation of retail and wholesale stores and clubs, as well as eCommerce websites and mobile 
applications, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. The Company 
previously operated in the United Kingdom and Japan prior to the sale of those operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. 
Refer to Note 12 for discussion of recent divestitures. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: 
Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the 
chief operating decision maker ("CODM") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company 
sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impracticable to segregate and identify revenues for 
each of these individual products and services.
The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchant concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce, which includes 
omni-channel initiatives and certain other business offerings such as advertising services through Walmart Connect. The 

omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the 
Company's segments.
The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating 
income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of 
each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly 
reviewed by its CODM. Information for the Company's segments, as well as for Corporate and support, including the 
reconciliation to income before income taxes, is provided in the following table:

ITEM 9.
CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND 
FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
None.
ITEM 9A.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is 
required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and 
evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and 
operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily 
required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since 
we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more 
limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries.
In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and 
processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control 
environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, 
automating manual processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations 
and increasing monitoring controls. We are currently upgrading our financial system in stages, beginning in our U.S. and 
Canadian markets, including our general ledger which was upgraded for these markets during fiscal 2024. Our financial system 
is a significant component of our internal control over financial reporting. We will continue to implement other components of 
our new financial system in stages, and each implementation will impact our internal control over financial reporting.
An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of January 31, 2024 
was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and 
Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that 
our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed 
by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated 
and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow 
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is 
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms.
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management has responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal 
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not 
prevent or detect misstatements. Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial 
reporting as of January 31, 2024. In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of 
Sponsoring Organizations ("COSO") of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). 
Management concluded that based on its assessment, Walmart's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of 
January 31, 2024. The Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2024, has been audited by Ernst & 
Young LLP as stated in their report which appears herein.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2024, that have 
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
