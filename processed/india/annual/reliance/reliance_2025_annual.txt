All statements that address expectations or projections about the future, but 
not limited to the Company’s strategy for growth, product development, market

Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

Dear Shareholders,
Nearly fifty years ago, our visionary 
founder, Shri Dhirubhai Ambani, 
embarked on a bold mission — 
to prove that India could build a 
world-class enterprise founded on 
innovation, integrity, and ambition. 
That belief became Reliance. And 
over the decades, Reliance has 
grown from an idea into one of the 
world’s most admired enterprises — 
a symbol of India’s entrepreneurial 
spirit and its limitless potential.
Shri. Mukesh D. Ambani
Chairman and Managing Director,

Today, Reliance is not just a company. 
It is a national institution that powers 
opportunity, progress, and prosperity 
for 1.45 billion Indians. Our journey has 
been extraordinary — transforming 
traditional industries, building globalscale capabilities, creating entirely new 
markets, and touching the everyday 
lives of our fellow citizens. But we have 
never paused to celebrate the past. 
Instead, each milestone has inspired 
us to aim higher, work harder, and lead 
with purpose.
Adapting Boldly, Evolving 
Relentlessly
The world is changing at breakneck 
speed — reshaped by digital disruption, 
global shifts, and technological 
breakthroughs. At Reliance, we see this 
not as a challenge but as an opportunity. 
We are reimagining our future and 
reshaping our businesses to become 
a new-age deep-tech enterprise.
From energy to entertainment, 
from retail to digital services, we are 
integrating next-generation technologies 
across every business vertical. Over 
1,000 of our in-house scientists are 
leading cutting-edge research in areas 
like AI, renewable energy, advanced 
materials, and digital platforms. 
Our manufacturing infrastructure 
is being future-proofed to support 
India’s aspiration to become a 
global manufacturing powerhouse. 
This evolution mirrors the journey of our 
What is Good for India
is Good for Reliance
CHAIRMAN AND MANAGING DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT
great nation as it steps confidently into 
the Amrit Kaal — a transformative era on 
the path to becoming a fully developed 
‘Viksit Bharat.’
India’s Moment. Reliance’s Resolve.
Today, India is standing tall on the global 
stage. Despite global uncertainties and 
geopolitical turbulence, our economy 
continues to demonstrate unmatched 
resilience and momentum. In FY25, 
India’s GDP growth remained nearly 
double the global average — propelled 
by robust domestic consumption, 
infrastructure development, 
thriving exports, and a dynamic 
digital ecosystem.
More importantly, India is no longer 
just following trends — it is setting 
them. From UPI’s global success to the 
India AI Mission, from green energy to 
space tech, India is shaping the future. 
This is India’s moment. And Reliance 
is proud to walk shoulder-to-shoulder 
with the nation — as a committed 
partner, a responsible value-creator, 
and a technology-driven enabler of 
inclusive growth.
Strong and Resilient Performance
Even amidst external volatility, Reliance 
delivered a year of solid and balanced 
growth. Our results speak to the 
strength of our diversified model and our 
deep-rooted execution discipline:
• Revenue: J 10,71,174 crore (+7.1% Y-o-Y)
• EBITDA: J 1,83,422 crore (+2.9% Y-o-Y)
• Net Profit: J 81,309 crore (+2.9% Y-o-Y)
Each business played a vital role in 
this performance:
• Retail: Crossed J 3,30,000 crore in 
turnover and expanded its footprint 
to 19,340 stores, strengthening its 
leadership in Indian Retail industry.
• Digital Services: Jio emerged as the 
world’s largest data network with 488 
million users, including 191 million 
on 5G.
• Media: Built a large and distinctive 
media institution, in partnership 
with Disney, across genres, marking 
the beginning of a new era in India’s 
entertainment landscape. Delivered 
record viewership and engagement 
metrics within the first few months of 
commencing operations.
• Oil to Chemicals (O2C): 
Demonstrated resilience through 
disciplined cost management and 
strong domestic placement.
• Oil & Gas: Delivered record EBITDA, 
with increased output from KG-D6 
and CBM blocks, enhancing India’s 
energy independence.
• New Energy: Transitioned from vision 
to execution — operationalising 
giga-scale solar and battery 
energy projects.
Creating the Future — Four New 
Engines of Growth
As Reliance approaches its Golden 
Jubilee, we have built high-powered 
growth engines: Retail, Digital Services, 
Media and Entertainment, and 
New Energy. Each of these platforms 
is technology-first, innovation-led, 
and positioned to disrupt industries 
while delivering massive value to Indian 
consumers and the global market.
Our O2C and Oil and Gas businesses will 
continue to grow while catering to India’s 
rising energy and materials demand.
We are not just scaling businesses 
— we are building platforms that 
empower people, reduce inequality, 
drive sustainability, and elevate India’s 
position in the global economy. Whether 
it’s transforming the way Indians shop, 
consume data, watch content, or power 
their homes and businesses — Reliance 
is shaping the future with purpose 
and conviction.
Our Foundation — Values, People, 
Vision
At the heart of Reliance’s success is 
a foundation built on values, trust, 
and talent. Our strong balance sheet, 
relentless focus on productivity, and 
unwavering commitment to excellence 
give us the confidence to embrace 
bold ambitions.
Our people — across every function and 
business — bring passion, ingenuity, 
and integrity to their work every day. 
Our Board provides the stewardship 
and wisdom that guides our long-term 
decisions. Our partners and vendors align 
closely with our purpose. And above all, 
our customers and shareholders place 
their trust in us — time and again — and 
that is our greatest strength.
Thank You for Believing in Us
To each of you — our valued 
shareholders — I express my deepest 
gratitude. Your unwavering belief in 
Reliance’s vision gives us the courage to 
keep pushing boundaries and building 
for the future.
The journey ahead is full of promise. With 
unwavering faith in India and steadfast 
commitment to innovation, sustainability 
and inclusion, Reliance is poised to rise 
to even greater heights. For India and for 
Reliance - the future shines bright!
With warm regards,
Mukesh D. Ambani
Chairman and Managing Director

Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

Operating Environment
Global economic growth remained 
healthy at 3.3% in CY24 consistent with 
the prior year. Global inflation eased 
to 5.7% in CY24 from 6.7% in CY23, 
supported by the stabilisation of supply 
chains post-COVID and a moderation in 
commodity prices. This enabled major 
central banks to ease monetary policy, 
lowering benchmark rates by 50 to 100 
bps in CY24.
However, geopolitical tension and policy 
uncertainties, including trade tariffs, led 
to volatility in global markets, adversely 
impacting energy demand, resulting 
in softer prices and narrower margins. 
Transportation fuel margins moderated 
from elevated levels, and downstream 
chemicals margins came under 
significant pressure due to incremental 
supply additions, particularly from China.
Despite global headwinds, the Indian 
economy was remarkably resilient. 
While growth moderated to 6.5% in 
FY 2024-25 from 9.2% in FY 2023-24, 
India retained its position as the fastest 
growing major economy in the world.
Domestic consumption witnessed 
mixed trends with rural demand 
strengthening, and urban consumption 
moderating. Macro-prudential regulatory 
tightening of credit in FY 2023-24 led 
to moderation in personal credit growth 
to 16% in FY 2024-25, from 27% in 
FY 2023-24. Consumption demand 
remained relatively soft during the 
first half with general elections and 
peak monsoon. The festive season and 
Mahakumbh revived domestic markets 
in the second half. However, pockets 
of urban and rural demand are yet to 
fully recover.
External balances in India saw continued 
strength in current account with resilient 
services surplus (current account deficit 
<1% of GDP). Net services exports 
clocked another 14% Y-o-Y growth, 
driven by continued momentum in digital 
services and Global Capability Centres 
Financial Performance and Review
(GCC). In the second half, capital inflows 
slowed as FPIs turned net sellers, leading 
to tighter liquidity. In response, the RBI 
cut the CRR by 50 bps in December, and 
subsequently reduced the policy repo 
rate by a cumulative 100 bps to 5.5% by 
June 2025. India remains well positioned 
for sustained high growth on the back 
of favourable demographics and a large 
domestic market.
Performance Overview

resilient performance for FY 2024-25, 
emphasising the strength of its Indiafocused, diverse business portfolio. 
Amidst prolonged global volatility, 
the Company delivered balanced and 
consistent growth across its businesses.
• Consolidated revenue increased by 
7.1% to J10,71,174 crore (US$ 125.3 
billion), compared to J10,00,122 crore 
in FY 2023-24
• EBITDA grew by 2.9% to J1,83,422 
crore (US$ 21.5 billion) from J1,78,290 
crore in the previous year, with 
consumer businesses contributing 
over 50% of consolidated EBITDA
• PAT rose 2.9% year-on-year to 
J81,309 crore (US$ 9.5 billion)
Segment Performance:
• Digital Services EBITDA grew 14.7% 
supported by widespread adoption 
of 5G and broadband across mobility, 
home, and enterprise segments. Tariff 
revision introduced during the year 
was well absorbed, with no adverse 
impact on data consumption trends.
• Retail EBITDA grew 8.6%, benefitting 
from productivity gains through 
network optimisation and improved 
operating metrics
• Oil and Gas EBITDA increased by 4.9% 
supported by a marginal increase in 
production from the KG D6 block
• Oil to Chemicals (O2C) EBITDA 
declined by 11.9%, impacted 
by weaker fuel cracks and lower 
petrochemical margins. The 
performance was supported by 
stronger domestic demand and 
feedstock flexibility. The segment 
witness increased fuel retail sales 
through Jio-bp, aided by a favourable 
margin environment.
• Consolidated cash profit increased 
to J1,46,917 crore, compared to 
J1,41,969 crore in FY 2023-24.
Consolidated Net Debt
RIL’s gross debt as on 31st Mar’25 stood 
at J 3,47,530 crore (US$ 40.7 billion) 
Net debt stood at J 1,17,083 crore 
(US$ 13.7 billion). Robust internal cashflow generation supported investments 
in growth opportunities across business, 
while maintaining a conservative 
balance sheet and investment grade 
credit ratings.
Capex
Capital expenditure for the financial 
year stood at J 1,31,107 crore (US$ 
15.3 billion), adequately covered 
by cash profits. FY 2023-24 capex 
was at J 1,31,769 crore. FY 2024-25 
investments were largely directed 
towards new O2C projects, Retail 
store expansion, augmenting Digital 
Services infrastructure and building 
manufacturing assets in New Energy.
Standalone
Standalone RIL revenue was at 
J 5,57,163 crore (US$ 65.2 billion), lower 
by 3.1% as compared to J 5,74,956 
crore in FY 2023-24. EBITDA for the 
standalone entity fell 14.2% to J 74,163 
crore (US$ 8.7 billion) from J 86,393 
crore for the year ago period. The O2C 
segment profitability was impacted by 
unfavourable global demand-supply 
balance, which was partially offset by 
improved upstream performance with 
higher volumes of gas and condensate. 
Standalone Profit After Tax was at 
J 35,262 crore (US$ 4.1 billion), down 
16.1% vis-a-vis J 42,042 crore last year.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS → BUSINESS OVERVIEW
Industry Overview
India’s retail industry has evolved 
into one of the most dynamic 
and rapidly expanding sectors, 
contributing immensely to the 
development of our country.
According to a recent report by the 
Boston Consulting Group and the 
Retailers Association of India, India’s 
retail sector is projected to reach 
an impressive ` 190 lakh crore by 
2034, growing at a compounded 
annual growth rate (CAGR) of 
9%. The share of organised retail 
constitutes 18% of the total retail 
market, while the unorganised 
segment, characterised by 
presence of millions of small 
kiranas, constitutes the remaining 
82%.
India remains one of the world’s 
fastest-growing retail markets and 
is poised to become the thirdlargest retail market by 2030.
Strategic Objective
Transform the 
retail landscape 
through synergistic 
partnerships creating 
shared wins for all 
stakeholders across 
the retail value chain. 
Guided by innovation 
and relentless focus on 
customer-centricity, 
Reliance Retail will 
continue to deliver 
exceptional value 
and a differentiated 
experience to Indian 
consumers across 
key categories 
and omnichannel 
platforms—shaping 
the future of retail 
in India.
Movement in 
Key Financial Ratios
The net capital turnover ratio improved 
from 25.43 in FY 2023-24 to 47.92 in 
FY 2024-25, due to reduction in net 
working capital.
The operating margin ratio declined to 
7.2% in FY 2024-25 as against 9.8% in 
previous year primarily due to weaker 
transportation fuels and downstream 
chemical margins.
The return on net worth* fell to 8.2% in 
FY 2024-25 as against 10.3% in previous 
year due to decline in O2C earnings.
*Adjusted for CWIP and revaluation
Liquidity and 
Capital Resources
Macro Environment
FY 2024–25 witnessed high volatility 
in financial markets. In India, first 
half of the financial year saw global 
outperformance of Indian assets 
driven by healthy growth momentum, 
continued improvement in fiscal 
health, which led to prospect of rating 
upgrade, and bond index inclusion flows. 
Softening global yield environment 
helped India benchmark 10y G-sec yield 
to ease decisively below 7%, while rupee 
remained stable.
However, second half of the financial 
year saw large outflows from foreign 
portfolio investors, softening of growth 
momentum in India and resurgence of 
China as an investment destination. This 
had a depreciative effect on INR and 
tightened banking system liquidity. As a 
result, from December 2024 onwards, 
RBI began easing financial conditions 
through a mix of CRR cut, Repo rate cuts 
and injection of rupee liquidity.
Fund Raising
Despite a volatile environment, RIL 
successfully executed a multi-currency, 
multi-instrument financing strategy, 
achieving an optimal capital structure at 
competitive costs. The proceeds were 
primarily utilised to fund green capital 
expenditures and to refinance upcoming 
debt maturities.
Offshore Facilities
Syndicated Term Loan 
Facilities (~$3 billion 
equivalent)
The Company secured these facilities to 
refinance maturing debt obligations.
ECA Supported Facilities
(~$1 billion equivalent)
RIL tied up ~$1 billion equivalent green 
SACE Push facilities supported by Italian 
Export Credit Agency (SACE) to finance 
capital expenditure towards eligible 
green projects. This is the first such fully 
green-labelled facility for the Company.
Liquidity Management
RIL maintains a robust liquidity 
management framework to ensure 
financial flexibility and resilience in 
all market conditions. The Company 
leveraged a diverse funding strategy 
and efficiently managed working capital. 
RIL’s surplus funds were deployed in 
stable yield instruments, insulated from 
unfavourable market movements to 
ensure immediate access to liquidity.
Credit Rating
RIL continues to be rated two notches above sovereign by S&P and one notch above 
sovereign by Moody’s.

Jio has led every 
communication 
technology transition 
in India
In less than a decade, Jio has driven 
India’s transition from data darkness 
to data abundance. This has been 
enabled by Jio’s vision and ahead of 
the curve investments on 4G LTE 
pre-2016, Fiber-To-The-Home in 2018, 
Standalone 5G in 2022, and FWA 
in 2024. Resultantly, Jio is now the 
world’s largest data operator carrying 
over 17 exabytes of data traffic 
monthly with a ~60% share of wireless 
data traffic in India. 
Jio continues to work on future 
communication technologies and is 
actively researching and developing 
6G technology, aiming to be a 
global leader in its development 
and deployment. To augment our 
technology leadership in building 
terrestrial networks, Jio is also building 
its own Satellite communication 
platform and partnering with SpaceX 
to offer Starlink’s broadband internet 
services to its customers in India.
Broadband adoption 
accelerates with 5G and 
Fixed Wireless
Improving device ecosystem and the 
pan-India rollout of 5G have boosted 
digital adoption. Jio significantly 
expanded its 5G user base in India with 
high per capita data usage. According 
to Ericsson Mobility Report, 5G 
subscriptions in India are expected to 
reach around 970 million by the end 
of 2030, accounting for 74% of mobile 
subscriptions. The rollout of fixed 
wireless infrastructure has accelerated 
the growth of fixed broadband in the 
country. Fixed wireless technology with 
point-to-multi-point radios is taking 
services to currently underserved semi 
urban/rural areas. India’s fixed broadband 
user base is expected to grow multifold 
from the current 47 million premises 
over the next few years.
Jio strengthens market 
leadership across 
mobility and fixed 
broadband 
As of March 2025, Jio had ~191 million 
5G users on its network contributing 
~45% of its wireless data traffic. Jio’s 
True5G network is the most awarded 
and shows a significant lead on 
performance and availability metrics 
across most network performance 
measurement platforms like 
OpenSignal and Ookla. 
Jio has connected ~18 million homes 
as of the end of FY 2024-25 and 
has accounted for ~85% of the 
total new additions in the industry 
during the fiscal year. Jio’s AirFiber 
solution has been the primary 
reason for the acceleration in pace 
of home connects extending reach 
to all parts of the country, especially 
beyond the top 1,000 cities. Jio 
remains confident of connecting 100 
million homes with a combination 
of Fiber and AirFiber broadband 
solutions bundled with digital TV and 
on‑demand entertainment.

in June 2024 and Jio enhanced its 
holdings in 1800 MHz band in Bihar 
and West Bengal. Jio’s spectrum 
footprint increased to 26,801 MHz 
(uplink + downlink), solidifying its 
leadership position.

Rules under Digital Personal Data 
Protection Act, 2023 to protect the

under the Telecom Commercial 
Communications Customer 
Preference (Second Amendment) 
Regulations, 2025 to strengthen

for Satellite-Based Commercial 
Communication Services.
Jio is a key catalyst and 
driver of digital adoption 
in India, powered by its 
world-class connectivity 
network and a suite of 
technology platforms. 
This has put India on the 
global map for connectivity 
infrastructure and consumer 
technology adoption. We

Industry Overview
Transportation Fuels
In FY 2024-25, the transportation fuel 
sector faced demand growth challenges 
on the back of geopolitics, energy 
transition, efficiency improvement, and 
economic concerns. Oil demand rose 
by 0.9 mb/d to 103.1 mb/d, while supply 
also increased by 1.1 mb/d to 103.3 
mb/d. Brent price averaged $ 78.2 per 
barrel amidst volatility. In CY24, Refinery 
throughput increased by 600 kb/d to 
reach 82.9 mb/d, led by new refineries 
capacity additions and stronger nonOECD throughputs.
In CY24, gasoline demand increased 
by only 89 kb/d and diesel growth 
deaccelerated by 158 kb/d. Major 
demand came from jet fuel, which surged 
by 397 kb/d. Key factors to watch in 
2025 would be stagnating demand in 
China (EV penetration), aviation growth in 
Asia, geopolitical uncertainties and new 
economic policies (tariffs & sanctions).
With consistent government push 
for roads and air connectivity, Indian 
Petroleum Product demand rose to an 
all-time high of 239 MMTPA at 2.1% Y-o-Y 
growth. Climate consciousness has led 
to a sustained rise in charging network 
presence, (close to 40,000 charging 
stations) with a 6 million EV parc. CNGCBG vehicle parc has also touched 
2 million.

Polymers and 
Elastomers
Polymer prices remained volatile during 
FY 2024-25 amidst global capacity 
additions, slowdown in consumption 
and recessionary concerns in 
developed markets. Polymer margins 
contracted during FY 2024-25 with 
PP-Naphtha, HDPE-Naphtha and PVC 
margins down by 2.2%, 9.5% and 3.7%, 
respectively. US Ethane prices declined 
by 9.0% Y-o-Y and Asian Naphtha 
prices increased by 4.1% Y-o-Y.
Intermediates and 
Polyesters
In FY 2024-25, PX-Naphtha margins 
decreased by 34.4%, due to weak 
global demand and oversupply. 
Integrated producers continued to 
optimise production based on PX vs. 
gasoline economics. PTA-PX margins 
decreased by 11.6% due to significant 
capacity expansion of PTA in China. 
MEG-Naphtha margin surged 45.9% 
from a low base, driven by firm product 
prices due to low inventory in China.
PET margins weakened due to 
substantial capacity increase in 
China and sluggish demand growth in 
Western countries. Filament and Staple 
margins improved due to slowdown 
in capacity additions and improved 
China demand.
Outlook 
Oil demand is likely to 
maintain growth despite EV 
penetrations, largely driven by 
strong economic growth, China 
stimulus measures and possible 
easing of geopolitical tension. 
Continuing geopolitical and 
tariff-related uncertainties may 
affect trade flows and 
demand‑supply balance. 
In 2025, ramp-up of new 
refineries may lead to weaker 
product cracks. However, 
expected closures could create 
upside potential for refining 
margins. Fuel demand in India is 
expected to remain healthy with 
increasing economic activity.
Demand for downstream 
chemical products in India is 
expected to grow ahead of GDP 
growth rate, driven by demand 
from infrastructure, packaging, 
automobiles and agriculture.

realignments, evolving sanctions and 
trade tariff regimes and rate of recovery 
of Chinese economy.
New refining capacity in Nigeria & 
China capped product prices and Red 
Sea blockage led to higher freight for 
shipping our products to Europe.
Downstream chemical product prices 
and margins remained under pressure 
with significant new capacity additions, 
especially in China.
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Powering a 
Net Carbon Zero Future
RIL is building a new energy 
ecosystem from the ground 
up—spanning photons 
to electrons to green 
molecules—across solar, 
storage, green hydrogen, and 
sustainable chemicals. The 
past year marked a defining 
phase in that journey.
Strategic Objective: From 
Ambition to Execution
Mission: Enable RIL’s transition to Net 
Carbon Zero by 2035 through a fully 
integrated, globally competitive clean 
energy platform.
Approach:
• Fully Integrate Across Value Chain 
for Each Giga Factory: Ability 
to capture margins across value 
chain, ensure supply chain security, 
and opportunistically play in 
various markets.
• Modular Giga-Scale Manufacturing: 
Each giga factory will be modular in 
execution and can be scaled easily.
• Deep-Tech R&D Capabilities: 
State‑of-the-art prototyping, testing 
and validation centres in India and 
deep research labs in Singapore, 
USA, and China.
• Global Partnerships: Collaborations 
with globally leading technology and 
product companies and academic 
research institutions.
• Energy Security and Economic 
Impact: Reduce import dependence, 
spur industrial investment, and 
create green jobs to redefine India’s 
energy future.
Global and Indian Energy 
Industry Overview
According to the IEA, global 
electricity demand is projected to rise 
significantly, with renewables playing 
a pivotal role in meeting this growth. 
By 2030, renewables are expected 
to generate nearly half of the world’s 
electricity, with wind and solar PV 
alone accounting for 30%—double 
their current share. This expansion is 
driven by the addition of over 5,500 
gigawatts of renewable capacity 
between now and 2030, equivalent to 
the current power capacity of China, 
the European Union, India, and the 
United States combined.
India too has ambitious goals:
500 GW
Non-fossil target by 2030
5 MMTPA
Production capacity by 2030 
under Green Hydrogen 
Mission
Reliance is positioned as a keystone 
player in India’s clean energy transition.

Kutch as well as for our green 
chemical projects.
Bio Energy: Turning 
Waste into Wealth
India’s vast biomass reserves—nearly 
230 million tonnes of surplus non-cattle 
feed—represent a dual opportunity: 
reduce air pollution and unlock rural 
economic value.
Since its inception in 2023, Reliance 
Bio Energy has become India’s largest 
integrated bioenergy platform. In 
FY 2024-25, we:
• Operationalised 7 CBG plant with 
~130 TPD production capacity (0.5 
lac TPA). These plants shall also 
produce 2 lacs TPA of high quality 
Fermented Organic Manure (FOM).
• On track to establish 55 CBG plants 
including integrated CBG Hub with 
a cumulative capacity of 0.4 MTPA of 
CBG and 2 MTPA of organic manure.
• Built the world’s largest bioenergy 
R&D centre in Jamnagar, focused on 
microbial innovation, crop science, 
automation, and plant energy 
self-reliance.
Our partnerships with state 
governments and research institutions 
like IGFRI Jhansi are accelerating 
innovation in drought-resistant energy 
crops and salinity-tolerant cultivation.

the Identified Sustainability 
Information listed in Appendix II 
and included in the Report is free 
from material misstatement.
 
As part of both reasonable 
and limited assurance 
engagement in accordance 
with the Standards, we exercise 
professional judgement and 
maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the engagement.
8. Reasonable 
Assurance
 
A reasonable assurance 
engagement involves identifying 
and assessing the risks of material 
misstatement of the Identified 
Sustainability Information whether 
due to fraud or error, responding 
to the assessed risks as necessary 
in the circumstances.
 
The procedures we performed 
were based on our professional 
judgement and included inquiries, 
observation of processes 
performed, inspection of 
documents, evaluating the 
appropriateness of quantification 
methods and reporting policies, 
analytical procedures and 
agreeing or reconciling with 
underlying records.
 
Given the circumstances of the 
engagement, in performing the 
procedures listed above, we:
• Obtained an understanding 
of the Identified 
Sustainability Information and 
related disclosures;
• Obtained an understanding 
of the assessment criteria 
and their suitability for 
the evaluation and/or 
measurements of the Identified 
Sustainability Information;
• Made inquiries of Company’s 
management, including 
the sustainability team, the 
environment team, the energy 
team, the compliance team, the 
human resource team, amongst

• Obtained an understanding 
and performed an evaluation of 
the design of the key systems, 
processes and controls for 
recording, processing and 
reporting on the Identified 
Sustainability Information 
at the corporate office and 
at other plants/offices on a 
sample basis. This included 
evaluating the design of 
those controls relevant to the 
engagement and determining 
whether they have been 
implemented by performing 
procedures in addition to 
inquiry of the personnel 
responsible for the Identified 
Sustainability Information;
• Based on the above 
understanding and the risks 
that the Identified Sustainability 
Information may be materially 
misstated, determined the 
nature, timing and extent of 
further procedures;
• Tested the key assumptions, 
emission factors and 
methodologies used for 
calculation of GHG emissions;
• Tested the Company’s process 
for collating the sustainability 
information through agreeing

the underlying records on a 
sample basis; and

various plants and offices 
on sample basis under the 
reporting boundary for ensuring 
the completeness of data 
being reported.
 
We believe that the evidence we 
have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for 
our reasonable assurance opinion.
9. Limited Assurance
 
A limited assurance engagement 
involves assessing the suitability 
in the circumstances of the 
Company’s use of the Criteria 
as the basis for the preparation 
of the Identified Sustainability 
Information as listed in Appendix

misstatement of the Identified 
Sustainability Information 
whether due to fraud or error, 
responding to the assessed risks 
as necessary in the circumstances, 
and evaluating the overall 
presentation of the Identified

A limited assurance engagement 
is substantially less in scope 
than a reasonable assurance 
engagement in relation to both 
the risk assessment procedures, 
including an understanding 
of internal controls, and the 
procedures performed in response 
to the assessed risks.
 
The procedures we performed 
were based on our professional 
judgement and included inquiries, 
observation of processes 
performed, inspection of 
documents and evaluating the 
appropriateness of reporting 
policies and agreeing with

further procedures; and
• Reviewed the Company’s 
process for collating the 
sustainability information 
through agreeing or reconciling 
the Identified Sustainability 
Information with the underlying 
records on a sample basis.
 
We believe that the evidence we 
have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for 
our limited assurance conclusion.
10. Exclusions
 
Our assurance scope excludes the 
following and therefore we do not 
express opinion/conclusion on:
• Operations of the Company 
other than the Boundary

are required to report that fact. 
We have nothing to report in 
this regard.

financial instruments (derivatives), 
that enable managing the

the timing and the usage of 
derivatives instruments such as 
Swaps/Futures/Options are taken 
based on various factors including 
market conditions, physical 
inventories, macro-economic 
situation. These decisions and 
execution are done in line with

SECRETARIAL AUDIT REPORT
For the Financial Year ended March 31, 2025
[Pursuant to section 204(1) of the Companies Act, 2013 read with Rule 9 of the Companies 
(Appointment and Remuneration of Managerial Personnel), Rules, 2014]
The Members

3rd Floor, Court House 
Lokmanya Tilak Marg
Dhobi Talao, Mumbai- 400 002
I have conducted the secretarial 
audit of the compliance of applicable 
statutory provisions and the adherence 
to good corporate practices by 

U01100MH1999PLC120563 (‘the 
Company’). Secretarial Audit was 
conducted in a manner that provided 
me a reasonable basis for evaluating 
the corporate conducts/ statutory 
compliances and expressing my 
opinion thereon.
Management’s 
responsibility
The Management along with the 
Board of Directors are responsible for 
ensuring that the Company complies 
with the provisions of all applicable 
laws and maintains the required 
statutory records and documents in the 
prescribed manner.
Auditor’s 
responsibility
Based on audit, my responsibility 
is to express an opinion on the 
compliance with the applicable laws 
and maintenance of records by the 
Company. I conducted my audit in 
accordance with the auditing standards 
CSAS 1 to CSAS 4 (‘CSAS’) prescribed 
by the Institute of Company Secretaries 
of India. These standards require that 
the auditor complies with statutory and 
regulatory requirements and plans and 
performs the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about compliance with 
applicable laws and maintenance 
of records.
Due to the inherent limitations of 
an audit including internal, financial 
and operating controls, there is 
an unavoidable risk that some 
misstatements or material noncompliances may not be detected, even 
though the audit is properly planned 
and performed in accordance with 
the CSAS.
Basis for Opinion
I have followed the audit practices 
and processes as were appropriate to 
obtain reasonable assurance about 
the correctness of the contents of the 
secretarial records. The verification 
was done on test basis to ensure 
that correct facts are reflected in 
the secretarial records. I believe 
that the processes and practices 
followed provide a reasonable basis for 
my opinion.
Opinion
Based on my verification of the 
Company’s books, papers, minute 
books, forms and returns filed and other 
records maintained by the Company 
and provided in physical mode or as 
scanned copies by email or through 
permitted access to the Company’s 
in-house portal and also the information 
provided by the Company, its officers 
and authorised representatives during 
the conduct of secretarial audit, I 
hereby report that in my opinion, the 
Company has, during the audit period 
covering the financial year ended on 
March 31, 2025 (‘the Audit Period’), 
complied with the statutory provisions 
listed hereunder and also that the 
Company has proper Board-processes 
and compliance-mechanism in place to 
the extent, in the manner and subject to

performance of the Company and its 
major subsidiaries consolidated with

Retail

of growth led by steady performance 
across all consumption baskets.
The business recorded a Gross Revenue 
of C 330,943 crore for the FY25 with 
a growth of 7.9% over last year. It has 
registered an EBITDA of C 25,094 
crore, growing by 8.6% Y-o-Y, driven 
by improved store productivity and 
effective cost management.
Strategic partnerships such as Shein, 
Asos, Delta Galil and Saks Fifth Avenue 
further reinforce Reliance Retail’s 
position as the partner of choice 
for international brands entering 
India. Reliance Retail continues to be 
India’s preferred retailer for consumer 
electronics, fashion & lifestyle 
and grocery.
Digital Services
Digital Services achieved a revenue 
of C 1,54,119 crore driven by tariff 
increase in the mobility business, 
ramp‑up of homes and enterprise 
services and scale up of digital 
platforms. The business registered 
an EBITDA of C 65,001 crore which 
was on account of higher revenue 
and consistent improvement in 
margins. Digital Services has delivered 
2X growth in EBITDA over the past 
four years.
Jio is the largest operator globally 
(outside China) by 5G subscribers, with 
191 million Jio True5G subscribers. 
JioAirFiber services has accelerated the 
pace of home connect and is close to 
global leadership in FWA with ~6 million 
homes. In addition, there is also strong 
momentum in revenue contribution 
from content bundling and cloud and 
IoT services for enterprises.
Media and 
Entertainment
During the year, JioStar - India’s largest 
media platform was created by the 
merger of Viacom18 and Star India. It 
brought together iconic brands across 
entertainment and sports, including 
Colors, Star Plus, Star Gold and Star 
Sports and integrated JioCinema and 
Disney+Hotstar into a single super 
streaming service, JioHotstar. JioStar 
reinforced its pre-eminent position 
in the Indian television landscape 
with 34% viewership share across 
Entertainment genres. JioHotstar 
scaled upto 280 million paying 
subscribers during IPL Season 18, the 
second highest globally and hit peak 
MAUs of 503 million in March 2025. 
The News business restructuring was 
also completed with the merger of 
Network18 and TV18, creating India’s 
biggest omni-channel news media 
powerhouse. The TV News network 
was No. 1 in India with leadership 
in national and regional markets. 
Moneycontrol was the undisputed 
leader in financial news segment. 
3 movies of Jio Studio were amongst 
the year’s top 5 Hindi hits.
Oil to Chemicals
Revenue of Oil to Chemicals for FY25 
increased by 11 % Y-o-Y to C 6,26,921 
crore on account of higher volumes and 
increased domestic product placement.
EBITDA of Oil to Chemicals for FY25 
was at C 54,988 crore, down by 
11.9%. Earnings were impacted by 
weak margin environment across 
transportation fuels and downstream 
chemicals. This was partially offset 

Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

BOARD’S REPORT
by feedstock sourcing, advantageous 
ethane cracking.
Strong domestic demand and 
conducive margin environment enabled 
higher domestic retail fuel placement 
through Jio-bp during the year.
Oil & Gas
Oil & Gas segment achieved highest 
ever revenue and EBITDA and 
witnessed 3.2% Y-o-Y increase in 
Revenue to C 25,211 crore & 4.9 % 
increase in EBITDA to C 21,188 crore. 
The increase is mainly on account of 
higher gas and condensate production 
from KG-D6 and CBM Field partly 
offset by lower gas price realisation.
KG D6 has three producing fields 
namely, R-Cluster, Sat-Cluster and MJ 
with combined average gas production 
of ~28 MMSCMD and oil & condensate 
production of ~21,000 bbls in FY25. 
Development is being planned for three 
additional wells in R Cluster and one 
additional well in Satellite Cluster which 
is expected to provide incremental 
recovery of ~240 BCF from these fields. 
Development Plan for these additional 
wells is approved by the Government.
In CBM, first 40 Multi-lateral Wells 
(MLW) campaign has been completed. 
The campaign has established > 3X 
productivity of MLWs compared to 
vertical wells. Incremental production 
of 0.4 MMSCMD from the 40 MLWs 
has helped in successfully reversing 
the field decline. Average field 
production for FY 25 is ~0.8 MMSCMD. 
Based on the success of first MLW 
campaign, the Company aims to 
continue MLW campaigns and prepare 
for development of CBM (East) and 
accordingly, has commenced second 
40 MLW campaign.
Together these fields are contributing 
to 30% of India’s Production.

are disclosed in the Management

2. Study: Outcome 
Monitoring of Women’s 
Economic Empowerment 
Programme (Swayamshree)
Impact Assessment Agency 
– Sambodhi Research and 
Communications Private Limited
Background
Reliance Foundation and the Gates 
Foundation’s Empowering Women 
Entrepreneurs (EWE) Programme for 
11 lakh women across Madhya Pradesh, 
Odisha, and Gujarat aims to enable 
women to earn up to C1 lakh annually 
while enhancing their income, quality of 
life, and decision-making power. 
Objective
To assess the underlying factors 
influencing baseline trends in women’s 
livelihoods and agency and document 
the learnings and best practices
Key findings:
Women, Livelihood, and Agency: Higher 
restrictions on mobility and participation 
in Madhya Pradesh due to social norms 
and domestic violence. More women 
in Gujarat identify as farmers than in 
Madhya Pradesh and Odisha.
Financial Behaviour and Digital Access: 
Low formal credit access, leading to 
informal loans, limited digital literacy, 
reducing uptake of digital financial tools 
and minimal WhatsApp use in Odisha 
and Gujarat.
Training and Capacity Building: Practices 
like multi-layer farming, home-made 
fertilizers, livestock training conducted.
Enterprise and Non-Timber Forest 
Produce (NTFP): Home-based 
enterprises provide secondary incomes.
Collectives: Farmer Interest Group (FIG) 
/ Producer Group (PG) participation is 
higher in Madhya Pradesh and Odisha 
while new groups are emerging in Gujarat, 
but leadership in Odisha restricted to 
few women.
Market Linkages: With weak market 
connections, few women are aggregators. 
Increasing women aggregators and 
involving men in market awareness could 
improve income and access.

Key Audit Matter
Auditor’s Response
Information Technology (IT) systems and controls over 
financial reporting
We identified IT systems and controls over financial reporting 
as a key audit matter for the Company because its financial 
accounting and reporting systems are fundamentally 
reliant on IT systems and IT controls to process significant 
transaction volumes, specifically with respect to revenue and 
raw material consumption. Also, due to such large transaction 
volumes and the increasing challenge to protect the integrity 
of the Company’s systems and data, cyber security has 
become more significant. Automated accounting procedures 
and IT environment controls, which include IT governance, 
IT general controls over program development and changes, 
access to program and data and IT operations, IT application 
controls and interfaces between IT applications, are required 
to be designed and to operate effectively to ensure accurate 
financial reporting.
Our procedures included and were not limited to 
the following:
• Assessed the complexity of the IT environment by engaging 
IT specialists and through discussion with the head of IT and 
internal audit at the Company and identified IT applications 
that are relevant to our audit.
• Tested the design, implementation and operating 
effectiveness of IT general controls over program development 
and changes, access to program and data and IT operations by 
engaging IT specialists.
• Performed inquiry procedures with the head of cybersecurity 
at the Company in respect of the overall security architecture 
and any key threats addressed by the Company in the 
current year.
• Tested the design, implementation and operating 
effectiveness of IT application controls in the key processes 
impacting financial reporting of the Company by engaging 
IT specialists.
• Tested the design, implementation and operating 
effectiveness of controls relating to data transmission through 
the different IT systems to the financial reporting systems by 
engaging IT specialists.
Information Other than the 
Financial Statements and Auditor’s 
Report Thereon
• The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the 
other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the Annual Report, but does not 
include the Consolidated Financial Statements, Standalone 
Financial Statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
• Our opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements does 
not cover the other information and we do not express any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon.
• In connection with our audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other 
information is materially inconsistent with the Standalone 
Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained during 
the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated.
• If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of this other information, 
we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to 
report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management 
and Board of Directors for the 
Standalone Financial Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the 
matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to 
the preparation of these Standalone Financial Statements 
that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial 
performance including other comprehensive loss, cash 
flows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance 
with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, 
including Ind AS specified under Section 133 of the Act. 
This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of 
the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and 
for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; 
selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; 
making judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls, that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness 
of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and 
presentation of the standalone financial statements that give 
a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error. 

STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Integrated Annual Report 2024-25
In preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, 
management and Board of Directors are responsible for 
assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless the Board of Directors either intend to liquidate the 
Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative 
but to do so. 
The Company’s Board of Directors is also responsible for 
overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process. 
Auditor’s Responsibility for the 
Audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these Standalone 
Financial Statements. 
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of 
the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due to fraud 
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive 
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The 
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
• Obtain an understanding of internal financial controls 
relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) 
of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion 
on whether the Company has adequate internal financial 
controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements 
in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by the management.
• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of 
the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the 
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty 
exists related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the Standalone Financial 
Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to 
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the 
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. However, future events or conditions may cause the 
Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the Standalone Financial Statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the Standalone Financial 
Statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the 
Standalone Financial Statements that, individually or in 
aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of 
a reasonably knowledgeable user of the Standalone Financial 
Statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative 
materiality and qualitative factors (i) in planning the scope of 
our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) 
to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the 
Standalone Financial Statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any 
significant deficiencies in internal financial controls that we 
identify during our audit. 
We also provide those charged with governance with a 
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and 
where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements of the current period and are therefore the key 
audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s 
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure 
about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, 
we determine that a matter should not be communicated in 
our report because the adverse consequences of doing so 
would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest 
benefits of such communication.

Report on the Internal Financial 
Controls with reference to

under clause (i) of sub-section 3 of 
Section 143 of the Companies Act, 
2013 (“the Act”)
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference 
to Standalone Financial Statements of Reliance Industries 
Limited (“the Company”) as at 31st March, 2025 in conjunction 
with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the 
Company for the year ended on that date. 
Management’s and Board of 
Directors’ Responsibilities for 
Internal Financial Controls
The Company’s management and Board of Directors are 
responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial 
controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements 
based on the internal control with reference to Standalone 
Financial Statements criteria established by the Company 
considering the essential components of internal control 
stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial 
Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”). These responsibilities 
include the design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of 
its business, including adherence to the Company’s policies, 
the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection 
of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the 
accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable 
financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's 
internal financial controls with reference to Standalone 
Financial Statements of the Company based on our audit. We 
conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on 
Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
(the “Guidance Note”) issued by the ICAI and the Standards 
on Auditing prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to 
the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls 
with reference to Standalone Financial Statements. Those 
Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply 
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial 
Statements was established and maintained and if such 
controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
with reference to Standalone Financial Statements and their 
operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls 
with reference to Standalone Financial Statements included 
obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with 
reference to Standalone Financial Statements, assessing the 
risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating 
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control 
based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend 
on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the 
risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with 
reference to Standalone Financial Statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial 
Controls with reference to 
Standalone Financial Statements
A company's internal financial control with reference to 
Standalone Financial Statements is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements 
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A company's internal financial 
control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements 
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately 
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the 
assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures 
of the Company are being made only in accordance with 
authorisations of management and directors of the Company; 
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention 
or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material 
effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal 
Financial Controls with reference to 
Standalone Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements, 
including the possibility of collusion or improper management 
override of controls, material misstatements due to error or 
fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any

because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of 
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

To the Independent Auditors’ Report
(Referred to in paragraph 2 under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our Report of even date)
In terms of the information and explanations sought by us and

the Company and the nature of its assets. Pursuant 
to the program, certain items of Property, Plant and 
Equipment were due for verification during the year 
and were physically verified by the Management 
during the year. According to the information and

were noticed on such verification.

the lease agreements are duly executed in favour 
of the Company) disclosed in the Standalone

and Equipment, according to information and

(ii) 
The inventories except for goods in transit 
were physically verified during the year by the

such verification by the Management is appropriate 
having regard to size of the Company and the 
nature of its operations. In respect of goods in 
transit, some of the goods have been received 
subsequent to the year-end. No discrepancies 
of 10% or more in the aggregate for each class 
of inventories were noticed on such physical 
verification when compared with books of account.

given to us, the Company has been sanctioned 
working capital limits in excess of C 5 crore, in 
aggregate, at points of time during the year, from

(Reserve Bank) Directions, 2016. There are 3 CICs 
forming part of the Group.
(xvii) The Company has not incurred cash losses during the 
financial year covered by our audit and the immediately 
preceding financial year.
(xviii) 
There has been no resignation of the statutory 
auditors of the Company during the year.
(xix) On the basis of the financial ratios disclosed in Note 
39 to the Standalone Financial Statements, ageing 
and expected dates of realisation of financial assets 
and payment of financial liabilities, other information 
accompanying the Standalone Financial Statements 
and our knowledge of the Board of Directors and 
management plans and based on our examination of 
the evidence supporting the assumptions, nothing has 
come to our attention, which causes us to believe that 
any material uncertainty exists as on the date of the 
audit report that Company is not capable of meeting its 
liabilities existing at the date of Balance Sheet as and 
when they fall due within a period of one year from the 
Balance Sheet date. We, however, state that this is not 
an assurance as to the future viability of the Company. 
We further state that our reporting is based on the facts 
up to the date of the audit report and we neither give 
any guarantee nor any assurance that all liabilities falling 
due within a period of one year from the Balance Sheet 
date, will get discharged by the Company as and when 
they fall due.

(xx) The Company has fully spent the required amount towards Corporate Social responsibility (CSR) and there are no unspent 
CSR amounts for the year requiring a transfer to a fund specified in Schedule VII of the Act or special account in compliance 
with the provision of sub-section (6) of Section 135 of the Act. Accordingly, reporting under clause 3(xx) of the Order is not 
applicable for the year.

to bringing the assets to its working condition for 
its intended use, net charges on foreign exchange 
contracts and adjustments arising from exchange 
rate variations attributable to the assets. In case of 
land the Company has availed fair value as deemed 
cost on the date of transition to Ind AS. 
 
 
Other Indirect Expenses incurred relating to 
project, net of income earned during the project 
development stage prior to its intended use, 
are considered as pre-operative expenses and 
disclosed under Capital Work-in-Progress.
 
 
Depreciation on Property, Plant and Equipment 
is provided using written down value method on 
depreciable amount except in case of certain 
assets of Oil to Chemicals and Other segment 
which are depreciated using straight-line method. 
Depreciation is provided based on useful life of 
the assets as prescribed in Schedule II to the 
Companies Act, 2013 except in respect of the 
following assets, where useful life is as under:
Particular
Depreciation
Fixed Bed Catalyst (useful 
life: 2 years or more)
Over its useful life as 
technically assessed
Fixed Bed Catalyst (useful 
life: up to 2 years)
100% depreciated in the 
year of addition
Plant and Machinery 
(useful life: 25 to 50 years)
Over its useful life as 
technically assessed
Buildings (Useful life: 30 to 
65 years)
Over its useful life as 
technically assessed
 
 
The residual values, useful lives and methods of 
depreciation of Property, Plant and Equipment are 
reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted 
prospectively, if appropriate.
 
(c) Leases 
 
 
The Company, as a lessee, recognises a rightof-use asset and a lease liability for its leasing 
arrangements, if the contract conveys the right 
to control the use of an identified asset. Initially 
the right-of-use assets measured at cost which 
comprises initial cost of the lease liability adjusted 
for any lease payments made at or before the 
commencement date plus any initial direct costs 
incurred. Subsequently measured at cost less 
any accumulated depreciation/ amortisation, 
accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted 
for any remeasurement of the lease liability.
 
 
The right-of-use assets is depreciated/ amortised 
using the straight-line method from the 
commencement date over the shorter of lease term 
or useful life of right-of-use asset.
 
 
The Company measures the lease liability at the 
present value of the lease payments that are not 
paid at the commencement date of the lease. 
The lease payments are discounted using the 
interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be 
readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily 
determined, the Company uses incremental 
borrowing rate.
 
 
For short-term and low value leases, the Company 
recognises the lease payments as an operating 
expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
 
(d) Intangible Assets
 
 
Intangible Assets are stated at cost of acquisition 
net of recoverable taxes, trade discount and 
rebates less accumulated amortisation/depletion 
and impairment losses, if any. Such cost includes 
purchase price, borrowing costs, and any cost 
directly attributable to bringing the asset to its 
working condition for the intended use, net charges 
on foreign exchange contracts and adjustments 
arising from exchange rate variations attributable to 
the Intangible Assets. 
 
 
Other Indirect Expenses incurred relating to 
project, net of income earned during the project 
development stage prior to its intended use, are 
considered as pre-operative expenses and disclosed 
under Intangible Assets Under Development.
 
 
The Company assesses if useful life of an 
intangible asset is finite or indefinite. A summary 
of amortisation/depletion policies applied to the 
Company’s Intangible Assets to the extent of 
depreciable amount is as follows:
Particular
Amortisation / Depletion
Technical 
Know-How
Over the useful life of the underlying 
assets ranging from 5 years to 35 years.
Computer 
Software
Over a period of 5 years.
Development 
Rights
W.r.t. Oil and Gas, depleted using the 
unit of production method. The cost of 
producing wells along with its related 
facilities including decommissioning 
costs are depleted in proportion of oil 
and gas production achieved vis-à-vis 
Proved Developed Reserves. The cost 
for common facilities including its 
decommissioning costs are depleted 
using Proved Reserves. With respect 
to other development rights, these are 
amortised over the period of contract.
Others
In case of Jetty, the aggregate amount 
amortised to date is not less than 
the aggregate rebate availed by the 
Company.
 
 
The amortisation period and the amortisation 
method for Intangible Assets with a finite useful life 
are reviewed at each reporting date.
 
(e) Inventories
 
 
Items of inventories are measured at lower of 
cost and net realisable value after providing for 
obsolescence, if any, except in case of by-products 
which are valued at net realisable value. 
 
 
Cost of finished goods, work-in-progress, raw 
materials, chemicals, stores and spares, packing 
materials, trading and other products are 
determined on weighted average basis.
 
(f) Provisions
 
 
Provisions are recognised when the Company has 
a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a 
result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow 
of resources embodying economic benefits will 
be required to settle the obligation and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation. If the effect of the time value of money 
is material, provisions are discounted using a current 
pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the 
risks specific to the liability. When discounting 
is used, the increase in the provision due to the 
passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. 
 
 
Provision for Decommissioning Liability
 
 
The Company records a provision for 
decommissioning costs towards site restoration 
activity. Decommissioning costs are provided at 
the present value of future expenditure using a 
current pre-tax rate expected to be incurred to fulfil 
decommissioning obligations and are recognised 
as part of the cost of the underlying assets. Any 
change in the present value of the expenditure, 
other than unwinding of discount on the provision, 
is reflected as adjustment to the provision and the 
corresponding asset. The change in the provision 
due to the unwinding of discount is recognised in 
the Statement of Profit and Loss.
 
(g) Contingent Liabilities
 
 
Disclosure of contingent liability is made when 
there is a possible obligation arising from past 
events, the existence of which will be confirmed 
only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one 
or more uncertain future events not wholly within 
the control of the Company or a present obligation 
that arises from past events where it is either not 
probable that an outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits will be required to settle or a 
reliable estimate of amount cannot be made.
 
(h) Current Tax and Deferred Tax
 
 
The tax expenses for the period comprise of current 
tax and deferred tax. The Company exercises 
judgment in computation of current tax considering 
the relevant rulings and reassesses the carrying 
amount of deferred tax assets at the end of each 
reporting period.

STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2025
 
(i) 
Share Based Payments
 
 
In case of Group equity-settled share-based 
payment transactions, where the Company grants 
stock options to the employees of its subsidiaries, 
the transactions are accounted by increasing 
the cost of investment in subsidiary with a 
corresponding credit in the equity.
 
(j) 
Foreign Currencies Transactions and 
Translation
 
 
Exchange gains or losses on foreign currency 
borrowings taken prior to April 1, 2016 which 
are related to the acquisition or construction of 
qualifying assets are adjusted in the carrying cost of 
such assets. 
 
(k) Revenue Recognition
 
 
Revenue from contracts with customers is 
recognised when control of the goods or services 
are transferred to the customer at an amount that 
reflects the consideration entitled in exchange for 
those goods or services. The Company is generally 
the principal as it typically controls the goods or 
services before transferring them to the customer.
 
 
Revenue is measured at the amount of 
consideration which the Company expects to be 
entitled to in exchange for transferring distinct 
goods or services to a customer as specified in the 
contract, excluding amounts collected on behalf of 
third parties (for example taxes and duties collected 
on behalf of the government). Consideration is 
generally due upon satisfaction of performance 
obligations and a receivable is recognised when it 
becomes unconditional. 
 
 
Generally, the credit period varies between 0-60 
days from the shipment or delivery of goods or 
completion of services as the case may be. The 
Company provides volume rebates to certain 
customers once the quantity of products purchased 
during the period exceeds a threshold specified and 
also accrues discounts to certain customers based 
on customary business practices which is derived 
on the basis of crude price volatility and various 
market demand – supply situations. Consideration 
are determined based on its most likely amount. 
Generally, sales of petroleum products contain 
provisional pricing features where revenue is initially 
recognised based on provisional price. Difference 
between final settlement price and provisional price 
is recognised subsequently. 
 
(l) 
Financial Instruments
 
 
Financial Assets
 
 
 
Purchase and sale of Financial Assets are 
recognised using trade date accounting. Trade 
receivables that do not contain a significant 
financing component are measured at 
transaction price.
 
 
 
The Company has elected to account for its 
investments in subsidiaries, associates and 
joint venture at cost less impairment loss 
(if any). 
 
 
 
All other equity investments are measured at 
fair value, with value changes recognised in 
Statement of Profit and Loss, except for those 
equity investments for which the Company 
has elected to present the value changes in 
‘Other Comprehensive Income’. However, 
dividend on such equity investments are 
recognised in Statement of Profit and loss 
when the Company’s right to receive payment 
is established. The investments in preference 
shares with the right to surplus assets which 
are in nature of equity in accordance with 
Ind AS 32 are treated as separate category 
of investment and measured at Fair Value 
Through Other Comprehensive Income 
(FVTOCI). Other Financial Assets are generally 
measured at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss 
(FVTPL) except where the Company, based 
on the business model objectives, measures 
these at Amortised Cost or Fair Value Through 
Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI).
 
 
 
The Company uses ‘Expected Credit Loss’ (ECL) 
model, for evaluating impairment of Financial 
Assets other than those measured at FVTPL.
 
 
 
Expected Credit Losses are measured through 
a loss allowance at an amount equal to: 
• The 12-months expected credit losses 
(expected credit losses that result from 
those default events on the financial 
instrument that are possible within 12 
months after the reporting date); or 
• Full lifetime expected credit losses 
(expected credit losses that result from all 
possible default events over the life of the 
financial instrument).
 
 
 
For Trade Receivables, the Company applies 
‘simplified approach’ which requires expected 
lifetime losses to be recognised from initial 
recognition of the receivables. 
 
 
 
The Company uses historical default rates to 
determine impairment loss on the portfolio 
of trade receivables. At every reporting date 
these historical default rates are reviewed 
and changes in the forward-looking estimates 
are analysed. 
 
 
 
For other assets, the Company uses 12 month 
ECL to provide for impairment loss where 
there is no significant increase in credit risk. If 
there is significant increase in credit risk full 
lifetime ECL is used. 
 
 
ii. 
Financial Liabilities
 
 
 
For trade and other payables maturing 
within one year from the balance sheet 
date, the carrying amounts are determined 
to approximate fair value due to the short 
maturity of these instruments.
 
 
iii. 
Derivative Financial Instruments and 
Hedge Accounting
 
 
 
The Company uses various derivative financial 
instruments such as interest rate swaps, 
currency swaps, forwards & options and 
commodity contracts to mitigate the risk of 
changes in interest rates, exchange rates and 
commodity prices. At the inception of a hedge 
relationship, the Company formally designates 
and documents the hedge relationship to 
which the Company wishes to apply hedge 
accounting and the risk management objective 
and strategy for undertaking the hedge.
 
 
 
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the 
fair value of derivatives are taken directly to 
Statement of Profit and Loss, except for the 
effective portion of cash flow hedge which is 
recognised in Other Comprehensive Income 
and later to Statement of Profit and Loss 
when the hedged item affects profit or loss 
or is treated as basis adjustment if a hedged 
forecast transaction subsequently results in 
the recognition of a Non-Financial Assets or 
Non-Financial liability. 
 
 
 
Hedges that meet the criteria for hedge 
accounting are accounted for as follows: 
 
 
 
Cash Flow Hedge
 
 
 
 
The Company designates derivative 
contracts or non-derivative Financial 
Assets/ Liabilities as hedging instruments 
to mitigate the risk of movement in 
interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
for foreign exchange exposure on highly 
probable future cash flows attributable to 
a recognised asset or liability or forecast 
cash transactions. 
 
 
 
Fair Value Hedge
 
 
 
 
The Company designates derivative 
contracts or non-derivative Financial 
Assets/Liabilities as hedging instruments 
to mitigate the risk of change in fair value 
of hedged item due to movement in 
interest rates, foreign exchange rates and 
commodity prices. 
 
 
iv. 
Offsetting 
 
 
 
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities are 
offset and the net amount is presented in 
the balance sheet when, and only when, the 
Company has a legally enforceable right to set 
off the amount and it intends, either to settle 
them on a net basis or to realise the asset and 
settle the liability simultaneously.
 
(m) Accounting for Oil and Gas Activity
 
 
Oil and Gas Joint Arrangement are in the nature of 
joint operations. Accordingly, assets and liabilities 
as well as income and expenditure are accounted on 
the basis of available information on a line-by-line 
basis with similar items in the Company’s Financial 
Statements, according to the participating interest 
of the Company.
 
 
The Company follows the Guidance Note on 
Accounting for Oil and Gas producing activities 
– Ind AS issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India for the purposes of the 
accounting. Seismic costs, geological and 
geophysical studies, petroleum exploration 
license fees and general and administration costs 
directly attributable to exploration and evaluation 
activities are expensed off. The costs incurred on 
acquisition of interest in oil and gas blocks and on 
exploration and evaluation other than those which 
are expensed off are accounted for as Intangible 
Assets Under Development. All development 
costs incurred in respect of proved reserves are 
also capitalised under Intangible Assets Under 
Development. Once a well is ready to commence 
commercial production, the costs accumulated in 
Intangible Assets Under Development are classified 
as Intangible Assets corresponding to proved 
developed oil and gas reserves. The exploration 
and evaluation expenditure which does not result 
in discovery of proved oil and gas reserves and all 
cost pertaining to production are charged to the 
Statement of Profit and Loss. 
 
 
The Company uses technical estimation of reserves 
as per the Petroleum Resources Management 
System guidelines 2011 and standard geological 
and reservoir engineering methods. The reserve 
review and evaluation is carried out annually.

Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2025
C. Critical Accounting Judgements 
and Key Sources of Estimation 
Uncertainty
 
The preparation of the Company’s Financial Statements 
requires management to make judgement, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenue, 
expenses, assets and liabilities and the accompanying 
disclosures. Uncertainty about these assumptions and 
estimates could result in outcomes that require a material 
adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities 
affected in next financial years.
(A) Estimation of Oil and Gas Reserves
 
The determination of the Company’s estimated oil and 
natural gas reserves requires significant judgements 
and estimates to be applied and these are regularly 
reviewed and updated. Factors such as the availability of 
geological and engineering data, reservoir performance 
data, acquisition and divestment activity, drilling of 
new wells, and commodity prices all impact on the 
determination of the Company’s estimates of its oil and 
natural gas reserves. The Company bases its proved 
reserves estimates on the requirement of reasonable 
certainty with rigorous technical and commercial 
assessments based on conventional industry practice 
and regulatory requirements.
 
Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are used to 
calculate depletion charges for the Company’s oil and 
gas properties. The impact of changes in estimated 
proved reserves is dealt with prospectively by amortising 
the remaining carrying value of the asset over the 
expected future production. Oil and natural gas reserves 
also have a direct impact on the assessment of the 
recoverability of asset carrying values reported in the 
Financial Statements.
 
Details on proved reserves and production both on 
product and geographical basis are provided in Note 33.2.
(B) Property Plant and Equipment/ Intangible 
Assets
 
Estimates are involved in determining the cost 
attributable to bringing the assets to the location and 
condition necessary for it to be capable of operating 
in the manner intended by the management. Property, 
Plant and Equipment/Intangible Assets are depreciated/
amortised over their estimated useful life, after taking 
into account estimated residual value. Management 
reviews the estimated useful life and residual values of 
the assets annually in order to determine the amount 
of depreciation/ amortisation to be recorded during 
any reporting period. The useful life and residual values 
are based on the Company’s historical experience 
with similar assets and take into account anticipated 
technological and future risks. The depreciation/
amortisation for future periods is revised if there are 
significant changes from previous estimates.
(C) Provisions
 
The timing of recognition and quantification of the 
liability (including litigations) requires the application 
of judgement to existing facts and circumstances, 
which can be subject to change. The carrying amounts 
of provisions and liabilities are reviewed regularly 
and revised to take account of changing facts 
and circumstances.
(D) Impairment of Financial and Non-Financial 
Assets
 
The impairment provisions for Financial Assets are based 
on assumptions about risk of default and expected cash 
loss rates. The Company uses judgement in making these 
assumptions and selecting the inputs to the impairment 
calculation, based on Company’s past history, existing 
market conditions as well as forward-looking estimates 
at the end of each reporting period.
 
In case of non-financial assets, assessment of 
impairment indicators involves consideration of future 
risks. Further, the Company estimates asset’s recoverable 
amount, which is higher of an asset’s or Cash Generating 
Units (CGU’s) fair value less costs of disposal and its 
value in use.
 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments 
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the 
asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, 
recent market transactions are taken into account, if 
no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate 
valuation model is used.
(E) Fair Value Measurement
 
For estimates relating to fair value of financial 
instruments Refer Note 36 of financial statements.
Property, Plant & Equipment, Intangible Assets, Capital Work-in-Progress and Intangible Assets Under Development.

VIII) Sensitivity Analysis
 
 
 
Significant Actuarial Assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate, expected 
salary increase and employee turnover. The sensitivity analysis below, have been determined based on reasonably 
possible changes of the assumptions occurring at end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions 
constant. The result of Sensitivity analysis is given below:
(C in crore)
Particulars
As at 
31st March, 2025
As at 
31st March, 2024
Decrease
Increase
Decrease
Increase
Change in rate of discounting
(delta effect of +/- 0.5%)

Change in rate of salary increase
(delta effect of -/+ 0.5%)

Change in rate of employee turnover
(delta effect of -/+ 0.5%)

These plans typically expose the Company to actuarial risks such as: Investment Risk, Interest Risk, Longevity Risk and 
Salary Risk.
Investment Risk
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is 
determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds.
Interest Risk
A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability; however, this will be partially 
offset by an increase in the return on the plan’s debt investments.
Longevity Risk
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate 
of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life 
expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability.
Salary Risk
The present value of the defined plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan 
participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability.

The reserve estimates for producing fields are revised based on the performance of producing fields and with respect to 
discovered fields, the revision are based on the revised geological and reservoir simulation studies. 
 
33.3 The Government of India (“GoI”), disallowed certain costs which the Production Sharing Contract (“PSC”), relating to Block 
KG-DWN-98/3 (“KG D6”) entitles the Company to recover. The Company maintains that the Contractor is entitled to recover 
all of its costs under the terms of the PSC and there are no provisions that entitle the GOI to disallow the recovery of any 
Contract Cost. The Company referred the issue to arbitration with GOI for resolution of disputes. The matter is presently at the 
stage of Final Hearing as part of arbitration proceedings. The demand from the GOI of $ 165 million (for C 1,407 crore) being 
the Company's share (total demand $ 247 million – C 2,111 crore) towards additional Profit Petroleum has been considered as 
contingent liability as on 31st March 2025.
 
 
In supersession of the Ministry’s Gazette notification no. 22011/3/2012-ONG.D.V. dated 10th January 2014, the GOI notified 
the New Domestic Natural Gas Pricing Guidelines, 2014 on 26th October 2014. The GOI had directed the Company to instruct 
customers to deposit differential revenue on gas sales from D1D3 field on account of the prices determined under the 
guidelines converted to NCV basis and the prevailing price prior to 1st November 2014 ($ 4.205 per MMBTU) to be credited to 
the gas pool account maintained by GAIL (India) Limited. The amount so deposited by customer to Gas Pool Account is C 295 
crore (net) as at 31th March 2025. Revenue has been recognised at the GoI notified prices on GCV basis, in respect of gas 
quantities sold from D1D3 field from 1st November 2014. This amount in the Gas Pool Account has also been challenged under 
cost recovery arbitration and is pending adjudication. 
 
33.4 (a) 
Government of India (“GoI”) sent a demand notice to the KG D6 block contractor (RIL, BP Exploration (Alpha) Limited 
and Niko (NECO) Limited) (together “Contractor”) on 3rd November 2016, on account of production of gas allegedly 
migrated from ONGC’s blocks. RIL, as operator and on behalf of the Contractor, initiated arbitration proceedings against 
the GoI. The Arbitral Tribunal vide its Final Award dated 24th July 2018 (“Arbitration Award”), upheld Contractor’s claims. 
Vide Judgment dated 9th May 2023, a single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court upheld the Arbitration Award and 
dismissed GoI’s appeal challenging the award. On an appeal by GOI, vide judgment dated 14th February 2025, the 
Division Bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court allowed GoI’s appeal and set aside the judgment of the single judge and 
the Arbitration Award.
 
 
 
A demand letter dated 1st March 2025 for payment of $ 2.81 billion (RIL share $ 1.87 billion) was sent by GoI to the 
Contractor. RIL, on 17th March 2025, responded that it is not liable to make any payment to GoI and that the demand 
letter is without any factual or legal basis and is liable to be withdrawn. RIL will be filing an appeal against the judgement 
of the Division Bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court.
 
 
(b) 
Arbitration was initiated by BG Exploration and Production India Limited and the Company (together the Claimants) 
against GOI under the PSCs for Panna – Mukta and Tapti blocks due to difference in interpretation of certain 
PSC provisions between Claimants and GOI. The Arbitration Tribunal has issued a number of final partial awards in this 
matter, some of which have (in part) not been in Claimant’s favour. The arbitration is ongoing and a final award is yet to be 
issued. The arbitration has also led to satellite litigation in India (presently ongoing) and in the UK, which has resulted in 
court judgements that have not always been entirely in RIL’s favour.
 
 
(c) 
NTPC filed suit in 2006 for specific performance of contract for supply of natural gas of 132 trillion BTU annually for a 
period of 17 years. This suit is still pending adjudication in the Bombay High Court and the Company's fact witnesses in 
the suit are to be cross examined by NTPC. On 2nd December 2024, an SLP was filed by RIL before the Supreme Court 
against an Order of the Bombay High Court in the NTPC suit, directing redaction of certain portions of RIL’s Affidavit. The 
matter is presently sub-judice.
 
 
Considering the complexity of above issues, the Company is of the view that any attempt for quantification of possible 
exposure to the Company will have an effect of prejudicing Company's legal position in the ongoing arbitration/ litigations. 
Moreover, the Company considers above demand/disputes as remote.

(III) The Income-Tax Assessments of the Company have been completed up to Assessment Year 2021-22. The total outstanding 
demand is H 387 crore as on date. Based on the decisions of the Appellate authorities and the interpretations of other relevant 
provisions of the Income tax Act, 1961, the Company has been legally advised that the demand raised is likely to be either deleted or 
substantially reduced and accordingly no provision is considered necessary.
(IV) On December 16, 2010, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) issued a show cause notice (“SCN”) inter alia to the 
Company (RIL) in connection with the trades by RIL in the stock exchanges in 2007 in the shares of Reliance Petroleum Limited, 
then a subsidiary of RIL. By an order dated March 24, 2017, the Whole Time Member (“WTM”) passed directions: (i) prohibiting 
inter alia RIL from dealing in equity derivatives in the ‘Futures & Options’ segment of stock exchanges, directly or indirectly, for a 
period of one year from the date of the order; and (ii) to disgorge from RIL an amount of H 447 crore along with interest at the rate 
of 12% per annum from November 29, 2007, till the date of payment On an appeal by RIL, Securities Appellate Tribunal (“SAT”) by 
a majority order (2:1), dismissed the appeal on November 5, 2020, and directed RIL to pay the disgorged amount within sixty days 
from the date of the order. The appeal of RIL and others has been admitted by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India. By its order 
dated December 17, 2020, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India directed RIL to deposit H 250 crore in the Investors’ Protection Fund, 
subject to the final result of the appeal and stayed the recovery of the balance, inclusive of interest, pending the appeal. RIL has 
complied with the order dated December 17, 2020, of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India. 
 
In the above matter, the adjudicating officer of SEBI (“AO”) while adjudicating the show cause notice dated November 21, 2017 
issued, inter alia, to RIL passed an order on January 1, 2021 imposing a penalty of H 25 crore on RIL. In the appeal filed by RIL, 
the Hon’ble Securities Appellate Tribunal vide order dated December 4, 2023, did not interfere with the order passed by the AO 
since the matter was already covered by its earlier decision dated November 5, 2020, which is in appeal by RIL before the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court. RIL has filed an appeal in the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India against Order dated December 4, 2023 of SAT. The 
Company continues to consider the aforesaid liability as contingent.

For current borrowings, the carrying amounts approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.
 
The financial instruments are categorised into three levels based on the inputs used to arrive at fair value measurements as 
described below:
 
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
 
Level 2: Inputs other than the quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or 
indirectly; and
 
Level 3: Inputs based on unobservable market data.
 
Valuation Methodology
 
All financial instruments are initially recognised and subsequently re-measured at fair value as described below:
 
The fair value of investment in quoted Equity Shares, Bonds, Government Securities, Treasury Bills, Certificate of Deposit and 
Mutual Funds is measured at quoted price or NAV.
 
The fair value of Interest Rate Swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable 
yield curves.
 
The fair value of Forward Foreign Exchange contracts and Currency Swaps is determined using observable forward exchange 
rates and yield curves at the balance sheet date.
 
The fair value of over-the-counter Foreign Currency Option contracts is determined using the Black Scholes valuation model.
 
Commodity derivative contracts are valued using available information in markets and quotations from exchange, brokers and 
price index developers.
 
The fair value for level 3 instruments is valued using inputs based on information about market participants assumptions and 
other data that are available.
 
The fair value of the remaining financial instruments is determined using discounted cash flow analysis.
 
All foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rate at reporting date.
Financial Risk Management
 
The Company’s activities expose it to variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign currency risk and interest rate 
risk), commodity price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. Within the boundaries of approved Risk Management Policy framework, 
the Company uses derivative instruments to manage the volatility of financial markets and minimise the adverse impact on its 
financial performance.
 
Market Risk
 
 
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in 
market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as equity 
price risk and commodity risk.
 
 
Foreign Currency Risk
 
 
 
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the Fair Value or Future Cash Flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes 
in foreign currency rates. Exposures can arise on account of the various assets and liabilities which are denominated in 
currencies other than Indian Rupee.

ii) 
Commodity Price Risk
 
 
Commodity price risk arises due to fluctuation in prices of crude oil, other feed stock and products. The company has a risk 
management framework aimed at prudently managing the risk arising from the volatility in commodity prices and freight costs. 
 
 
The Company’s commodity risk is managed centrally through well-established trading operations and control processes. In 
accordance with the risk management policy, the Company enters into various transactions using derivatives and uses overthe-counter as well as Exchange Traded Futures, Options and Swap contracts to hedge its commodity and freight exposure.
 
iii) 
Credit Risk
 
 
Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform or pay the amounts due causing 
financial loss to the Company. Credit risk arises from company’s activities in investments, dealing in derivatives and receivables 
from customers. The Company ensure that sales of products are made to customers with appropriate creditworthiness. 
Investment and other market exposures are managed against counterparty exposure limits. Credit information is regularly 
shared between businesses and finance function, with a framework in place to quickly identify and respond to cases of 
credit deterioration. 
 
 
The company has a prudent and conservative process for managing its credit risk arising in the course of its business activities. 
Credit risk is actively managed through Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees, Parent Company Guarantees, advance payments 
and factoring & forfaiting without recourse to the Company to avoid concentration of risk. The company restricts its fixed 
income investments to liquid securities carrying high credit rating.
 
iv) 
Liquidity Risk
 
 
Liquidity risk arises from the Company’s inability to meet its cash flow commitments on the due date. The company maintains 
sufficient stock of cash, marketable securities and committed credit facilities. The company accesses global and local financial 
markets to meet its liquidity requirements. It uses a range of products and a mix of currencies to ensure efficient funding from 
across well-diversified markets and investor pools. Treasury monitors rolling forecasts of the Company’s cash flow position and 
ensures that the Company is able to meet its financial obligation at all times including contingencies. 
 
 
The Company’s liquidity is managed centrally with operating units forecasting their cash and liquidity requirements. Treasury 
pools the cash surpluses from across the different operating units and then arranges to either fund the net deficit or invest the 
net surplus in a range of short-dated, secure and liquid instruments including short-term bank deposits, money market funds, 
reverse repos and similar instruments. The portfolio of these investments is diversified to avoid concentration risk in any one 
instrument or counterparty.

Hedge Accounting
 
The Company’s business objective includes safe-guarding its earnings against adverse price movements of crude oil and other 
feedstock, refined products, freight costs as well as foreign exchange and interest rates. The Company has adopted a structured 
risk management policy to hedge all these risks within an acceptable risk limit and an approved hedge accounting framework which 
allows for Fair Value and Cash Flow hedges. Hedging instruments include exchange traded futures and options, over-the-counter 
swaps, forwards and options as well as non-derivative instruments to achieve this objective.
 
There is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments. The Company has established a hedge 
ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships. To test the hedge effectiveness, the Company uses the hypothetical derivative method 
and critical term matching method.
 
The hedge ineffectiveness can arise from:
 
- Differences in the timing of the cash flows. 
 
- Different indexes (and accordingly different curves). 
 
- The counterparties’ credit risk differently impacting the fair value movements.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Integrated Annual Report 2024-25
To The Members of Reliance Industries Limited
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Financial 
Statements of Reliance Industries Limited (“the Parent”) 
which includes its joint operations and its subsidiaries (the 
Parent and its subsidiaries together referred to as “the 
Group”), and the Group’s share of profit / loss in its associates 
and joint ventures, which comprise the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet as at 31st March, 2025, and the Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive 
Income), the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and the 
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for the year 
ended on that date, and Notes to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements, including a summary of material accounting 
policies and other explanatory information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us, and based on the 
consideration of reports of the other auditors on separate / 
consolidated financial statements / financial information of 
the subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures referred to in 
the Other Matters section below, the aforesaid Consolidated 
Financial Statements give the information required by the 
Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in the manner so required 
and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian 
Accounting Standards prescribed under Section 133 of the 
Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules, 2015, as amended (‘Ind AS’), and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated 
state of affairs of the Group as at 31st March, 2025, and their 
consolidated profit, their consolidated total comprehensive 
income, their consolidated cash flows and their consolidated 
changes in equity for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing 
(SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our 
responsibilities under those Standards are further 
described in the Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the Group, its associates and joint 
ventures in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by 
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) 
together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to 
our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements under the 
provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We 
believe that the audit evidence obtained by us and the audit 
evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their 
reports referred to in the sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of the 
Other Matters section below, is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements of the current period. 
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole, and 
in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the 
matters described below to be the key audit matters to be 
communicated in our report.

The Parent has certain significant ongoing legal 
proceedings for various complex matters with the 
Government of India and other parties, continuing from 
earlier years, which are as under:
Matters in relation to Oil and Gas:

of the controls established by the Parent in the process of 
evaluation of litigation matters.

the in-house legal expert and external legal opinions obtained by 
the Parent (where considered necessary) on both, the probability 
of success in the aforesaid cases, and the magnitude of any 
potential loss.

respect of these litigations during the year ended 31st March

made in relation to Order passed by the Securities and 
Exchange Board of India (‘SEBI’) under Section 11B of 
the SEBI Act, 1992 in connection with trades by the 
Parent in the stock exchanges in 2007 in the shares 
of Reliance Petroleum Limited, then subsidiary of the 
Parent, against which an appeal has been filed with 
the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India which is pending.
 
Refer Note 34 (III) to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
 
Due to complexity involved in these litigation matters, 
management’s judgement regarding recognition, 
measurement and disclosure of provisions for these 
legal proceedings is inherently uncertain and might

are determined.
 
Accordingly, it has been considered as a key 
audit matter.

assessed the responses received.

counsel involved in the process.

78,339 crore in Equity and Preference Shares of Jio Digital 
Fibre Private Limited (‘JDFPL’) which are measured at fair 
value as per Ind AS 109 read with Ind AS 113.
These investments are Level 3 investments as per 
the fair value hierarchy in Ind AS 113 and accordingly 
determination of fair value is based on a high degree 
of judgement and input from data that is not directly 
observable in the market. Further, the fair value is 
significantly influenced by the expected pattern of future 
benefits of the tangible assets of JDFPL (fibre assets).
Accordingly, it has been considered as a key audit matter.
Refer Notes 2 and 36A to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
Our audit procedures included and were not limited to 
the following:
• Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness 
of the controls established by the Parent in the process of 
determination of fair value of the investments.

Key Audit Matter
Auditor’s Response
Revenue Recognition
(a) 
The auditors of Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited (‘RJIL’), 
a step-down subsidiary of the Parent, have reported 
revenue recognition as a key audit matter due to the 
high volumes of data processed by the IT systems and 
the complexity of those IT systems.
In respect of the key audit matter reported to us by the 
auditors of RJIL, we performed inquiry of and oversight on 
the audit procedures performed by them to address the key 
audit matter. As reported by the subsidiary auditors, the audit 
procedures performed by them included and were not limited 
to the following:
• Evaluated and tested the design, implementation and operating 
effectiveness of the relevant business process controls, inter-alia 
controls over the capture, measurement and authorisation of 
revenue transactions, involving internal Information Technology 
(IT) specialists for the automated controls, interface controls and 
reports generated through various relevant IT systems involved 
in the revenue process.
• Involved internal IT specialists and tested the IT environment 
inter-alia for access controls, change management and 
application specific controls in the IT Systems over RJIL’s billing 
and other relevant support systems.
• Tested collections and the reconciliation between revenue per the 
billing system and the financial records. Performed procedures to 
test the computation of revenue and deferred revenue.
(b) 
The auditors of Reliance Retail Ventures Limited 
(‘RRVL’), a subsidiary of the Parent, have reported 
revenue recognition as a key audit matter at its 
subsidiary viz., Reliance Retail Limited (‘RRL’). RRL 
is engaged in organised retail and the trading 
transactions generating revenue comprising of 
high volume of individually small transactions which 
increases the risk of revenue being recognised 
inappropriately and which highlights the criticality 
of sound internal processes of summarising and 
recording sales. RRL trades in various consumption 
baskets on a principal basis and recognises full 
value of consideration as its revenue. The revenue 
is recognised on transfer of control of traded goods 
to the customers. Transfer of control coincides with 
collection of cash or cash equivalent from customers. 
In view of the above and since revenue is a key 
performance indicator for RRL, revenue recognition is 
identified as a key audit matter.
In respect of the key audit matter reported to us by the 
auditors of RRVL, we performed inquiry of and oversight on 
the audit procedure performed by them to address the key 
audit matter. As reported by the subsidiary auditor, the audit 
procedures performed by them included and were not limited 
to the following:
• Obtained understanding of the process followed by the 
management to record the revenue from each store.
• Evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of 
the internal controls established by RRL over reconciliation of 
revenue recorded with underlying collection made by RRL.
• Involved information technology specialist to test the automated 
controls and reports involved in the reconciliation of revenue.
• On a test-check basis, selected samples of stores on various 
dates. For such selections, obtained details of revenue recorded 
through various modes of payment from RRL’s accounting 
system. Reconciled revenue recorded as per such details with 
the underlying collection made by RRL as per cash receipts, 
merchant payment reports, and other third party supporting.
Information Technology (IT) systems and controls over 
financial reporting
We identified IT systems and controls over financial reporting 
as a key audit matter for the Parent because its financial 
accounting and reporting systems are fundamentally 
reliant on IT systems and IT controls to process significant 
transaction volumes, specifically with respect to revenue and 
raw material consumption. Also, due to such large transaction 
volumes and the increasing challenge to protect the integrity 
of the Parent’s systems and data, cyber security has become 
more significant. Automated accounting procedures and 
IT environment controls, which include IT governance, IT 
general controls over program development and changes, 
access to program and data and
Our procedures included and were not limited to the following:
• Assessed the complexity of the IT environment by engaging 
IT specialists and through discussion with the head of IT and 
internal audit at the Parent and identified IT applications that are 
relevant to our audit.
• Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness 
of IT general controls over program development and changes, 
access to program and data and IT operations by engaging 
IT specialists.
Independent Auditor’s Report
Sr. 
No.
Key Audit Matter
Auditor’s Response
IT operations, IT application controls and interfaces 
between IT applications, are required to be designed and to 
operate effectively to ensure accurate financial reporting.
• Performed inquiry procedures with the head of cyber security at 
the Parent in respect of the overall security architecture and any 
key threats addressed by the Parent in the current year.
• Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness 
of IT application controls in the key processes impacting financial 
reporting of the Parent by engaging IT specialists.
• Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness 
of controls relating to data transmission through the different 
IT systems to the financial reporting systems by engaging 
IT specialists.
Business Combination
During the year, the Parent acquired control over Star 
India Private Limited (SIPL) by way of Composite Scheme 
of Arrangement (the “Scheme”) involving demerger of 
Group’s media and Jio Cinema undertaking into SIPL and 
the Group consequently acquired control of SIPL.
The auditors of SIPL, a subsidiary of the Parent, have 
reported to us, the audit of accounting of this reverse 
acquisition to be a key audit matter since this is a 
significant transaction during the year that required 
significant management judgement regarding:
• Determination of the acquisition date.
• Determination of the fair value of 
consideration transferred.
• Identification and measurement of the fair value of the 
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
• Identification of intangible assets acquired through 
business combination. 
• Allocation of the purchase price to identifiable assets 
and liabilities.
• Accounting and disclosures in the financial statements in 
accordance with the applicable Ind AS.
Refer Note 42 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In respect of the key audit matter reported to us by the 
auditors of SIPL, we performed inquiry of and oversight on 
the audit procedures performed by them to address the 
key audit matter. As reported by the subsidiary auditor, the 
audit procedures performed by them included and were not 
limited to:
• Examined the terms and conditions of the Scheme 
in order to validate the management’s assessment of 
acquisition date.
• Evaluated the design and tested the operating 
effectiveness of internal controls relating to business 
acquisition accounting and the process of determination of 
purchase price allocation.

assets including intangible assets and liabilities assumed 
by reading through the Scheme, discussions with the 
management and understanding of the business.
• Assessed the management’s determination of fair values 
for assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and the methods 
used to value the underlying assets and liabilities by:
• Reviewing the valuation report prepared by the 
management appointed external valuation specialists by 
involvement of internal valuation specialists.
• Involving our internal valuation specialists in assessing the 
appropriateness of the methods used to determine the 
fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed including assumptions. 
• Assessing the objectivity and competence of our internal 
specialist and SIPL’s external experts involved in the process. 
• Evaluated appropriateness of disclosures in accordance 
with the applicable accounting standards. 
• Obtained Management Representation Letter as regards 
the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

Statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
• Our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements does

Statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information, compare with the financial statements / 
financial information of the subsidiaries, joint ventures and 
associates audited by the other auditors, to the extent it 
relates to these entities and, in doing so, place reliance on the 
work of the other auditors and consider whether the other 
information is materially inconsistent with the Consolidated 
Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained during the 
course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. Other information so far as it relates to the 
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, is traced from 
their financial statements / financial information audited by 
the other auditors.
• If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we 
are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in 
this regard.
Responsibilities of Management 
and Board of Directors for the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
The Parent’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters 
stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the 
preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements 
that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial 
position, consolidated financial performance including other 
comprehensive loss, consolidated cash flows and consolidated 
changes in equity of the Group including its associates and 
joint ventures in accordance with the accounting principles 
generally accepted in India including Ind AS specified under 
Section 133 of the Act. The respective Board of Directors of 
the companies included in the Group and of its associates and 
joint ventures are responsible for maintenance of adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the 
Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group and its associates 
and its joint ventures and for preventing and detecting frauds 
and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate 
accounting policies; making judgements and estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to 
the preparation and presentation of the financial statements 
that give a true and fair view and are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have 
been used for the purpose of preparation of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements by the Board of Directors of the Parent, 
as aforesaid.
In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the 
respective Management and Board of Directors of the 
companies included in the Group and of its associates and 
joint ventures are responsible for assessing the ability of the 
respective entities to continue as a going concern, disclosing, 
as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the 
going concern basis of accounting unless the respective Board 
of Directors either intend to liquidate their respective entities or 
to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included 
in the Group and of its associates and joint ventures are also 
responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of 
the Group and of its associates and joint ventures.
Auditor’s Responsibility for the 
Audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to fraud 
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to 
those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is 
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, 
or the override of internal control.
• Obtain an understanding of internal financial controls 
relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the Parent has adequate internal financial 
controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements 
in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
Independent Auditor’s Report
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by the management.
• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use 
of the going concern basis of accounting and, based 
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may 
cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group and its 
associates and joint ventures to continue as a going concern. 
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are 
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the 
related disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements 
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. 
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up 
to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or 
conditions may cause the Group and its associates and joint 
ventures to cease to continue as a going concern.
• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the Consolidated Financial 
Statements represent the underlying transactions and events 
in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the 
financial information of the entities or business activities 
within the Group and its associates and joint ventures to 
express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
We are responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the audit of the financial statements of such 
entities or business activities included in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements of which we are the independent 
auditors. For the other entities or business activities included 
in the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been 
audited by the other auditors, such other auditors remain 
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of 
the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible 
for our audit opinion.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements that, individually or in 
aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable user of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative 
materiality and qualitative factors (i) in planning the scope of 
our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) 
to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance of the 
Parent and such other entities included in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements of which we are the independent auditors 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of 
the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant 
deficiencies in internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a 
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where 
applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements of the current period and are therefore the key 
audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s 
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure 
about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, 
we determine that a matter should not be communicated in 
our report because the adverse consequences of doing so 
would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest 
benefits of such communication.

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the

Independent Auditor’s Report
Report on the Internal Financial 
Controls with reference to 
Consolidated Financial Statements 
under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of 
Section 143 of the Companies Act, 
2013 (“the Act”)
In conjunction with our audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements of Reliance Industries Limited (hereinafter

controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements 
of the Parent and its subsidiary companies, its associate 
companies and joint venture companies, which are companies 
incorporated in India, as of that date.
Management’s and Board of 
Directors’ Responsibilities for 
Internal Financial Controls
The respective Board of Directors of the Parent, its subsidiary 
companies, its associate companies and joint venture 
companies, which are companies incorporated in India, are 
responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial 
controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements 
based on the internal control with reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements criteria established by the respective 
Companies considering the essential components of internal 
control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal 
Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). These 
responsibilities include the design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were 
operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient 
conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective 
company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the 
prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely 
preparation of reliable financial information, as required under 
the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal 
financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements of the Parent, its subsidiary companies, its 
associate companies and its joint venture companies, which 
are companies incorporated in India, based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial 
Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the ICAI and the 
Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) 
of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal 
financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require 
that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether adequate internal financial controls with reference 
to Consolidated Financial Statements was established and 
maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all 
material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements and 
their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial 
controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements 
included obtaining an understanding of internal financial 
controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing 
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of 
internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures 
selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to fraud 
or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and 
the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors of the 
subsidiary companies, associate companies and joint venture 
companies, which are companies incorporated in India, 
in terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters 
paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls 
with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements of the 
Parent, its subsidiary companies, its associate companies 
and its joint venture companies, which are companies 
incorporated in India.
Meaning of Internal Financial 
Controls with reference to 
Consolidated Financial Statements
A company’s internal financial control with reference to 
Consolidated Financial Statements is a process designed 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements 
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A company’s internal financial control 
with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements 
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately 
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the 
assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures 
of the Company are being made only in accordance with 
authorisations of management and directors of the Company; 
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention 
or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or

disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material 
effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal 
Financial Controls with reference to 
Consolidated Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements, 
including the possibility of collusion or improper management 
override of controls, material misstatements due to error or 
fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of 
any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference 
to Consolidated Financial Statements to future periods 
are subject to the risk that the internal financial control 
with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements may 
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that 
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures 
may deteriorate.

In our opinion to the best of our information and according to 
the explanations given to us and based on the consideration 
of the reports of the other auditors referred to in the 
Other Matters paragraph below, the Parent, its subsidiary 
companies, associate companies and joint venture 
companies, which are companies incorporated in India, have,

essential components of internal control stated in the

Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered

The right-of-use assets is depreciated / amortised 
using the straight-line method from the 
commencement date over the shorter of lease term 
or useful life of right-of-use asset.
 
 
The Group measures the lease liability at the 
present value of the lease payments that are not 
paid at the commencement date of the lease. 
The lease payments are discounted using the 
interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can 
be readily determined. If that rate cannot be 
readily determined, the Group uses incremental 
borrowing rate.
 
 
For short-term and low value leases, the Group 
recognises the lease payments as an operating 
expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
 
(e) Intangible Assets
 
 
Intangible Assets are stated at cost of acquisition 
net of recoverable taxes, trade discount and rebate 
less accumulated amortisation / depletion and 
impairment loss, if any. Such cost includes purchase 
price, borrowing costs, and any cost directly 
attributable to bringing the asset to its working 
condition for the intended use, net charges on 
foreign exchange contracts and adjustments arising 
from exchange rate variations attributable to the 
Intangible Assets.
 
 
Other Indirect Expenses incurred relating 
to project, net of income earned during 
the project development stage prior to its 
intended use, are considered as pre-operative 
expenses and disclosed under Intangible Assets 
Under Development.
 
 
The Group assesses if useful life of an intangible 
asset is finite or indefinite. A summary of the 
amortisation / depletion policies applied to the 
Group’s Intangible Assets with a finite life to the 
extent of depreciable amount is as follows.
Particulars
Amortisation
Technical 
Know-How
Over the useful life of the underlying 
assets ranging from 5 years to 35 years
Computer 
Software
Over a period of 5 to 10 years.
Development 
Rights
With respect to Oil and Gas, 
depleted using the unit of production 
method. The cost of producing 
wells along with its related facilities 
including decommissioning costs 
are depleted in proportion of oil and 
gas production achieved vis-à-vis 
Proved Developed Reserves. The cost 
for common facilities including its 
decommissioning costs are depleted 
using Proved Reserves. With respect 
to other development rights, these are 
amortised over the period of contract.
License Fee
Amortised over the remainder of 
the license period from the date of 
commencement of the commercial 
operation.
Spectrum 
Fees
Amortised from the date of 
commencement of commercial 
operation over the balance validity 
period, based on the expected pattern 
of consumption of the expected future 
economic benefits, in accordance with 
the applicable Accounting Standards.

Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

Particulars
Amortisation
Others
In case of Jetty, the aggregate amount 
amortised to date is not less than 
the aggregate rebate availed by the 
Group. In case of Platforms and related 
Product Developments, over a period 
ranging from 5 to 25 years. 
 
 
The amortisation period and the amortisation 
method for Intangible Assets with a finite useful life 
are reviewed at each reporting date.
 
(f) Inventories
 
 
Items of inventories are measured at lower of 
cost and net realisable value after providing for 
obsolescence, if any, except in case of by-products 
which are valued at net realisable value.
 
 
Cost of finished goods, work-in-progress, raw 
materials, chemicals, stores and spares, packing 
materials, trading and other products are 
determined on weighted average basis.
 
(g) Provisions
 
 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has 
a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a 
result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow 
of resources embodying economic benefits will 
be required to settle the obligation and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation. If the effect of the time value of money 
is material, provisions are discounted using a 
current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, 
the risks specific to the liability. When discounting 
is used, the increase in the provision due to the 
passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
 
 
Provision for Decommissioning Liability
 
 
The Group records a provision for decommissioning 
costs towards site restoration activity. 
Decommissioning costs are provided at the 
present value of future expenditure using a current 
pre-tax rate expected to be incurred to fulfil 
decommissioning obligations and are recognised 
as part of the cost of the underlying assets. Any 
change in the present value of the expenditure, 
other than unwinding of discount on the provision, 
is reflected as adjustment to the provision and the 
corresponding asset. The change in the provision 
due to the unwinding of discount is recognised in 
the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
 
(h) Contingent Liabilities
 
 
Disclosure of contingent liability is made when 
there is a possible obligation arising from past 
events, the existence of which will be confirmed 
only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one 
or more uncertain future events not wholly within 
the control of the Group or a present obligation 
that arises from past events where it is either not 
probable that an outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits will be required to settle or a 
reliable estimate of amount cannot be made.
 
(i) 
Current Tax and Deferred Tax
 
 
The tax expenses for the period comprise of current 
tax and deferred tax. The Group exercises judgment 
in computation of current tax considering the 
relevant rulings and reassesses the carrying amount 
of deferred tax assets / liabilities at the end of each 
reporting period.
 
(j) 
Share Based Payments
 
 
In case of Group equity-settled share-based 
payment transactions, where the Company grants 
stock options to the employees of its subsidiaries, 
the transactions are accounted by increasing 
the cost of investment in subsidiary with a 
corresponding credit in the equity.
 
(k) Foreign Currencies Transactions and 
Translation
 
 
Exchange gains or losses on foreign currency 
borrowings taken prior to 1st April, 2016 which 
are related to the acquisition or construction of 
qualifying assets are adjusted in the carrying cost 
of such assets.
 
(l) 
Revenue Recognition
 
 
Revenue from contracts with customers is 
recognised when control of the goods or services 
are transferred to the customer at an amount that 
reflects the consideration entitled in exchange for 
those goods or services. The Group is generally 
considered as principal, as it typically controls 
the goods or services before transferring them to 
the customer.
 
 
Revenue is measured at the amount of 
consideration which the Group expects to be 
entitled to in exchange for transferring distinct 
goods or services to a customer as specified in the 
contract, excluding amounts collected on behalf of 
third parties (for example taxes and duties collected 
on behalf of the government). Consideration is 
generally due upon satisfaction of performance 
obligations and a receivable is recognised when it 
becomes unconditional. Generally, the credit period 
varies between 0-60 days from the shipment 
or delivery of goods or completion of services 
as the case may be. The Group provides volume 
rebates to certain customers once the quantity of 
products purchased during the period exceeds a 
threshold specified and also accrues discounts to 
certain customers based on customary business 
practices which is derived on the basis of crude 
price volatility and various market demand – supply 
situations. Consideration are determined based on 
its most likely amount. Generally, sales of petroleum 
products contain provisional pricing features where 
revenue is initially recognised based on provisional 
price. Difference between final settlement price 
and provisional price is recognised subsequently.
 
(m) Financial Instruments
 
 
Financial Assets
 
 
 
Purchase and sale of Financial Assets are 
recognised using trade date accounting. Trade 
receivables that do not contain a significant 
financing component are measured at 
transaction price.
 
 
 
The investments in associates and joint 
venture are accounted on equity method.
 
 
 
All other equity investments are measured 
at fair value, with value changes recognised 
in Statement of Profit and Loss, except for 
those equity investments for which the Group 
has elected to present the value changes in 
‘Other Comprehensive Income’. However, 
dividend on such equity investments are 
recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss 
when the Company’s right to receive payment 
is established. The investments in preference 
shares with the right to surplus assets which 
are in nature of equity in accordance with 
Ind AS 32 are treated as separate category 
of investment and measured at Fair Value 
Through Other Comprehensive Income 
(FVTOCI). Other Financial Assets are generally 
measured at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss 
(FVTPL) except where the Group, based on 
the business model objectives, measures 
these at Amortised Cost or Fair Value Through 
Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI).
 
 
 
The Group uses ‘Expected Credit Loss’ (ECL) 
model, for evaluating impairment of Financial 
Assets other than those measured at Fair 
Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL).
 
 
 
Expected Credit Losses are measured through 
a loss allowance at an amount equal to:
• The 12-months expected credit losses 
(expected credit losses that result from 
those default events on the financial 
instrument that are possible within 12 
months after the reporting date); or
• Full lifetime expected credit losses 
(expected credit losses that result from all 
possible default events over the life of the 
financial instrument).
 
 
 
For Trade Receivables, the Group applies 
‘simplified approach’ which requires expected 
lifetime losses to be recognised from initial 
recognition of the receivables.
 
 
 
The Group uses historical default rates to 
determine impairment loss on the portfolio 
of trade receivables. At every reporting date 
these historical default rates are reviewed 
and changes in the forward-looking estimates 
are analysed.
 
 
 
For other assets, the Group uses 12 month 
ECL to provide for impairment loss where 
there is no significant increase in credit risk. 
If there is significant increase in credit risk full 
lifetime ECL is used.
 
 
ii. 
Financial Liabilities
 
 
 
For trade and other payables maturing 
within one year from the balance sheet 
date, the carrying amounts are determined 
to approximate fair value due to the short 
maturity of these instruments.
 
 
iii. 
Derivative Financial Instruments and 
Hedge Accounting
 
 
 
The Group uses various derivative financial 
instruments such as interest rate swaps, 
currency swaps, forwards & options and 
commodity contracts to mitigate the risk of 
changes in interest rates, exchange rates and 
commodity prices. At the inception of a hedge 
relationship, the Group formally designates 
and documents the hedge relationship to 
which the Group wishes to apply hedge 
accounting and the risk management 
objective and strategy for undertaking 
the hedge.
 
 
 
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the 
fair value of derivatives are taken directly to 
Statement of Profit and Loss, except for the 
effective portion of cash flow hedge which is 
recognised in Other Comprehensive Income 
and later to Statement of Profit and Loss 
when the hedged item affects profit or loss 
or is treated as basis adjustment if a hedged 
forecast transaction subsequently results in 
the recognition of a Non-Financial Assets or 
Non-Financial liabilities.
 
 
 
Hedges that meet the criteria for hedge 
accounting are accounted for as follows:
 
 
 
Cash Flow Hedge
 
 
 
 
The Group designates derivative 
contracts or non-derivative Financial 
Assets / Liabilities as hedging 
instruments to mitigate the risk of 
movement in interest rates and foreign 
exchange rates for foreign exchange 
exposure on highly probable future cash 
flows attributable to a recognised asset 
or liability or forecast cash transactions.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2025
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

 
 
 
Fair Value Hedge
 
 
 
 
The Group designates derivative 
contracts or non-derivative Financial 
Assets / Liabilities as hedging 
instruments to mitigate the risk of 
change in fair value of hedged item due 
to movement in interest rates, foreign 
exchange rates and commodity prices.
 
 
iv. 
Offsetting
 
 
 
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities are 
offset and the net amount is presented in 
the balance sheet when, and only when, the 
Group has a legally enforceable right to set 
off the amount and it intends, either to settle 
them on a net basis or to realise the asset and 
settle the liability simultaneously.
 
(n) Accounting for Oil and Gas Activity
 
 
Oil and Gas Joint Arrangement are in the nature of 
joint operations. Accordingly, assets and liabilities 
as well as income and expenditure are accounted 
on the basis of available information on a lineby-line basis with similar items in the Financial 
Statements, according to the participating interest 
of the Group.
 
 
The Group follows the Guidance Note on 
Accounting for Oil and Gas producing activities 
– Ind AS issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India for the purpose of accounting. 
Seismic costs, geological and geophysical studies, 
petroleum exploration license fees and general 
and administration costs directly attributable to 
exploration and evaluation activities are expensed 
off. The costs incurred on acquisition of interest 
in oil and gas blocks and on exploration and 
evaluation other than those which are expensed 
off are accounted for as Intangible Assets Under 
Development. All development costs incurred in 
respect of proved reserves are also capitalised 
under Intangible Assets Under Development. 
Once a well is ready to commence commercial 
production, the costs accumulated in Intangible 
Assets Under Development are classified as 
Intangible Assets corresponding to proved 
developed oil and gas reserves. The exploration 
and evaluation expenditure which does not result 
in discovery of proved oil and gas reserves and all 
cost pertaining to production are charged to the 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
 
 
The Group uses technical estimation of reserves as 
per the Petroleum Resources Management System 
guidelines 2011 and standard geological and 
reservoir engineering methods. The reserve review 
and evaluation is carried out annually.
C. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING 
JUDGEMENTS AND KEY 
SOURCES OF ESTIMATION 
UNCERTAINTY
 
The preparation of the Group’s financial statements 
require management to make judgement, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenue, 
expenses, assets and liabilities and the accompanying 
disclosures. Uncertainty about these assumptions 
and estimates could result in outcomes that require a 
material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or 
liabilities affected in future periods.
 
(A) ESTIMATION OF OIL AND GAS 
RESERVES
 
 
The determination of the Group’s estimated 
oil and natural gas reserves require significant 
judgements and estimates to be applied and these 
are regularly reviewed and updated. Factors such 
as the availability of geological and engineering 
data, reservoir performance data, acquisition 
and divestment activity, drilling of new wells, and 
commodity prices all impact on the determination 
of the Group’s estimates of its oil and natural gas 
reserves. The Group bases its proved reserves 
estimates on the requirement of reasonable 
certainty with rigorous technical and commercial 
assessments based on conventional industry 
practice and regulatory requirements.
 
 
Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are used to 
calculate depletion charges for the Group’s oil and 
gas properties. The impact of changes in estimated 
proved reserves is dealt with prospectively by 
amortising the remaining carrying value of the 
asset over the expected future production. Oil 
and natural gas reserves also have a direct impact 
on the assessment of the recoverability of asset 
carrying values reported in the financial statements.
 
 
Details on proved reserves and production both 
on product and geographical basis are provided in 
Note 33.
 
(B) PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT / 
OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
 
 
Estimates are involved in determining the cost 
attributable to bringing the assets to the location 
and condition necessary for it to be capable 
of operating in the manner intended by the 
management. Property, Plant and Equipment / 
Other Intangible Assets are depreciated / amortised 
over their estimated useful life, after taking into 
account estimated residual value. Spectrum Cost 
is amortised over its balance validity period, based 
on the expected pattern of consumption of the 
expected future economic benefits.
 
 
Management reviews the estimated useful life 
and residual values of the assets annually in 
order to determine the amount of depreciation / 
amortisation to be recorded during any reporting 
period. The useful life and residual values are 
based on the Group’s historical experience with 
similar assets and take into account anticipated 
technological and future risks. The depreciation / 
amortisation for future periods is revised if there are 
significant changes from previous estimates.
 
(C) PROVISIONS
 
 
The timing of recognition and quantification of 
the liability (including litigations) requires the 
application of judgement to existing facts and 
circumstances, which can be subject to change. 
The carrying amounts of provisions and liabilities 
are reviewed regularly and revised to take account 
of changing facts and circumstances.
 
(D) IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL, 
INTANGIBLE ASSETS UNDER 
DEVELOPMENT AND INTANGIBLE 
ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE USEFUL LIFE
 
 
Management reviews the carrying value of 
goodwill, intangible assets under development 
and intangible assets with indefinite useful 
life annually, to determine whether there has 
been any impairment by allocating the value of 
goodwill, intangible assets under development and 
intangible assets with indefinite useful life to a Cash 
Generating Unit (CGU). The Group has identified 
CGUs’ for this purpose, considering the nature of 
the businesses to which each of the CGU relates.
 
 
Value in use i.e. the enterprise value of each CGU is 
aggregate of cash flow projections, for five years as 
approved by Senior Management and beyond five 
years extrapolated using a long-term growth rate 
which ranges from 2% to 5%. Cash flow projections 
are discounted by a pre-tax discount rate, being the 
Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), which 
ranges from 8% to 12%.
 
 
The Management believes that any reasonably 
possible change in the above key assumptions 
on which recoverable amount is based would not 
cause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed the 
aggregate recoverable amount of the CGU.
 
 
Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
have been allocated to the respective CGUs. During 
the year ended March 31, 2025, the Group has 
determined that there is no impairment towards 
these assets.
 
(E) IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL AND 
NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS
 
 
The impairment provisions for Financial Assets 
are based on assumptions about risk of default 
and expected cash loss rates. The Group uses 
judgement in making these assumptions and 
selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation, 
based on Group’s past history, existing market 
conditions as well as forward-looking estimates at 
the end of each reporting period.
 
 
In case of non-financial assets, the Group estimates 
asset’s recoverable amount, which is higher of an 
asset’s or Cash Generating Units (CGU’s) fair value 
less costs of disposal and its value in use.
 
 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using 
pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value 
less costs of disposal, recent market transactions 
are taken into account, if no such transactions 
can be identified, an appropriate valuation model 
is used.
 
(F) FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT
 
 
For estimates relating to fair value of financial 
instruments refer Note 36 of Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
 
(G) LEASES
 
 
The Group evaluates if an arrangement qualifies 
to be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 
116. Identification of a lease requires significant 
judgement. The Group uses judgement in assessing 
whether a contract (or part of contract) include 
a lease, the lease term (including anticipated 
renewals), the applicable discount rate, variable 
lease payments whether are in-substance fixed. 
The judgement involves assessment of whether 
the asset included in the contract is a fully or 
partly identified asset based on the facts and 
circumstances, whether the contract include 
a lease and non-lease component and if so, 
separation thereof for the purpose of recognition 
and measurement, determination of lease term 
basis, inter alia the non-cancellable period of 
lease and whether the lessee intends to opt for 
continuing with the use of the asset upon the expiry 
thereof, and whether the lease payments are fixed 
are variable or a combination of both.

The estimates of Rate of Escalation in salary considered in actuarial valuation, take into account inflation, seniority, promotion 
and other relevant factors including supply and demand in the employment market. The above information is certified by 
the actuaries.
 
 
The Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets is determined considering several applicable factors, mainly the composition of Plan 
Assets held, assessed risks, historical results of return on Plan Assets and the Group’s policy for Plan Assets Management.
 
VIII) The expected contributions for Defined Benefit Plan for the next financial year will be in line with financial year 2024‑25.
 
IX) 
These plan’s typically expose the Group to actuarial risks such as: Investment Risk, Interest Risk, Longevity Risk and 
Salary Risk.
Investment Risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is determined 
by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds.
Interest Risk
A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability; however, this will be partially offset by an 
increase in the return on the plan's debt investments.
Longevity Risk
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the 
mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of 
the plan participants will increase the plan's liability.
Salary Risk
The present value of the defined plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan 
participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability.

The reserve estimates for producing fields are revised based on the performance of producing fields and with respect to 
discovered fields, the revision are based on the revised geological and reservoir simulation studies.
 
33.3 The Government of India (“GoI”), disallowed certain costs which the Production Sharing Contract (“PSC”), relating to Block 
KG‑DWN-98/3 (“KG D6”) entitles the Company to recover. The Company maintains that the Contractor is entitled to recover all of its 
costs under the terms of the PSC and there are no provisions that entitle the GOI to disallow the recovery of any Contract Cost. The 
Company referred the issue to arbitration with GOI for resolution of disputes. The matter is presently at the stage of Final Hearing as 
part of arbitration proceedings. The demand from the GOI of $ 165 million (for C 1,407 crore) being the Company’s share (total demand 
$ 247 million – C 2,111 crore) towards additional Profit Petroleum has been considered as contingent liability as on 31st March 2025.
 
 
In supersession of the Ministry’s Gazette notification no. 22011/3/2012-ONG.D.V. dated 10th January 2014, the GOI notified the New 
Domestic Natural Gas Pricing Guidelines, 2014 on 26th October 2014. The GOI had directed the Company to instruct customers to 
deposit differential revenue on gas sales from D1D3 field on account of the prices determined under the guidelines converted to NCV 
basis and the prevailing price prior to 1st November 2014 ($ 4.205 per MMBTU) to be credited to the gas pool account maintained by 
GAIL (India) Limited. The amount so deposited by customer to Gas Pool Account is C 295 crore (net) as at 31th March 2025. Revenue 
has been recognised at the GoI notified prices on GCV basis, in respect of gas quantities sold from D1D3 field from 1st November 2014. 
This amount in the Gas Pool Account has also been challenged under cost recovery arbitration and is pending adjudication. 
 
33.4 (a) 
Government of India (“GoI”) sent a demand notice to the KG D6 block contractor (RIL, BP Exploration (Alpha) Limited and 
Niko (NECO) Limited) (together “Contractor”) on 3rd November 2016, on account of production of gas allegedly migrated 
from ONGC’s blocks. RIL, as operator and on behalf of the Contractor, initiated arbitration proceedings against the GoI. The 
Arbitral Tribunal vide its Final Award dated 24th July 2018 (“Arbitration Award”), upheld Contractor’s claims. Vide Judgment 
dated 9th May 2023, a single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court upheld the Arbitration Award and dismissed GoI’s appeal 
challenging the award. On an appeal by GOI, vide judgment dated 14th February 2025, the Division Bench of the Hon’ble 
Delhi High Court allowed GoI’s appeal and set aside the judgment of the single judge and the Arbitration Award.
 
 
 
A demand letter dated 1st March 2025 for payment of $ 2.81 billion (RIL share $ 1.87 billion) was sent by GoI to the 
Contractor. RIL, on 17th March 2025, responded that it is not liable to make any payment to GoI and that the demand letter 
is without any factual or legal basis and is liable to be withdrawn. RIL will be filing an appeal against the judgement of the 
Division Bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court.
 
 
(b) 
Arbitration was initiated by BG Exploration and Production India Limited and the Company (together the Claimants) against 
GOI under the PSCs for Panna – Mukta and Tapti blocks due to difference in interpretation of certain PSC provisions 
between Claimants and GOI. The Arbitration Tribunal has issued a number of final partial awards in this matter, some 
of which have (in part) not been in Claimant’s favour. The arbitration is ongoing and a final award is yet to be issued. 
The arbitration has also led to satellite litigation in India (presently ongoing) and in the UK, which has resulted in court 
judgements that have not always been entirely in RIL’s favour.
 
 
(c) 
NTPC filed suit in 2006 for specific performance of contract for supply of natural gas of 132 trillion BTU annually for a period 
of 17 years. This suit is still pending adjudication in the Bombay High Court and the Company’s fact witnesses in the suit are to 
be cross examined by NTPC. On 2nd December 2024, an SLP was filed by RIL before the Supreme Court against an Order of the 
Bombay High Court in the NTPC suit, directing redaction of certain portions of RIL’s Affidavit. The matter is presently sub-judice.
 
 
Considering the complexity of above issues, the Company is of the view that any attempt for quantification of possible exposure 
to the Company will have an effect of prejudicing Company’s legal position in the ongoing arbitration / litigations. Moreover, the 
Company considers above demand / disputes as remote.

(III) On December 16, 2010, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) issued a show cause notice (“SCN”) inter alia to the 
Company (RIL) in connection with the trades by RIL in the stock exchanges in 2007 in the shares of Reliance Petroleum Limited, then 
a subsidiary of RIL. By an order dated March 24, 2017, the Whole Time Member (“WTM”) passed directions: (i) prohibiting inter alia RIL 
from dealing in equity derivatives in the ‘Futures & Options’ segment of stock exchanges, directly or indirectly, for a period of one year 
from the date of the order; and (ii) to disgorge from RIL an amount of H 447 crore along with interest at the rate of 12% per annum 
from November 29, 2007, till the date of payment On an appeal by RIL, Securities Appellate Tribunal (“SAT”) by a majority order (2:1), 
dismissed the appeal on November 5, 2020, and directed RIL to pay the disgorged amount within sixty days from the date of the 
order. The appeal of RIL and others has been admitted by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India. By its order dated December 17, 2020, 
the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India directed RIL to deposit H 250 crore in the Investors’ Protection Fund, subject to the final result of 
the appeal and stayed the recovery of the balance, inclusive of interest, pending the appeal. RIL has complied with the order dated 
December 17, 2020, of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India.
 
In the above matter, the adjudicating officer of SEBI (“AO”) while adjudicating the show cause notice dated November 21, 2017 issued, 
inter alia, to RIL passed an order on January 1, 2021 imposing a penalty of H 25 crore on RIL. In the appeal filed by RIL, the Hon’ble 
Securities Appellate Tribunal vide order dated December 4, 2023, did not interfere with the order passed by the AO since the matter 
was already covered by its earlier decision dated November 5, 2020, which is in appeal by RIL before the Hon’ble Supreme Court. RIL 
has filed an appeal in the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India against Order dated December 4, 2023 of SAT. The Company continues to 
consider the aforesaid liability as contingent.
(IV) Hathway Cable and Datacom Limited has received Show Cause cum Demand notices (“SCNs”) from the Department of 
Telecommunications (“DOT”), Government of India towards license fees aggregating to H 3,202 crore which includes penalty and 
interest thereon (March 31, 2024: H 3,202 crore including penalty and interest). The Group has made representations to DOT contesting 
the basis of such demands. Based on opinion of legal expert, the Group is confident that it has good grounds on merit to defend itself in 
the above matter. Accordingly, the Group is of the view that no provision is necessary in respect of the aforesaid matter.
(V) 
Den Networks Limited (“DEN”) has received demand of H 628 crore from the Department of Telecom (DOT) during provisional 
assessment towards the license fees for the years 2010-11 to 2015-16 considering revenue from the cable business and other income 
for the purpose of calculating AGR or license fees. Demand was initially raised on DEN. However, revised demand of H 2,157 crore 
including interest and penalty calculated up till date has been raised on Den Broadband Limited (wholly owned subsidiary of DEN) for 
the years 2011-2012 to 2015-2016. In view of management and based on legal opinion obtained, these demands are unenforceable. 
DEN has filed various petitions before the Hon’ble TDSAT challenging these demands. In all the petitions, the Hon’ble TDSAT has 
restrained DOT from taking any coercive measure for realisation of the demands.
35. Capital Management
 
The Group adheres to a disciplined Capital Management framework in order to maintain a strong balance sheet. The main objectives 
are as follows:
 
Maintain investment grade ratings for all issuing entities, domestically and internationally by ensuring that the financial strength 
of their Balance Sheets are preserved.
 
Manage foreign exchange, interest rates and commodity price risk, and minimise the impact of market
volatility on earnings.
 
Diversify sources of financing and spread the maturity across tenure buckets in order to manage liquidity risk.
 
Leverage optimally in order to maximise shareholder returns.

The financial instruments are categorised into three levels based on the inputs used to arrive at fair value measurements as 
described below:
 
 
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
 
 
Level 2: Inputs other than the quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or 
indirectly; and
 
 
Level 3: Inputs based on unobservable market data.
 
 
Valuation Methodology
 
 
All financial instruments are initially recognised and subsequently re-measured at fair value as described below:
 
 
The fair value of investment in quoted Equity Shares, Bonds, Government Securities, Treasury Bills, Certificate of Deposits 
and Mutual Funds is measured at quoted price or NAV.
 
 
The fair value of Interest Rate Swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on 
observable yield curves.
 
 
The fair value of Forward Foreign Exchange contracts and Currency Swaps is determined using observable forward 
exchange rates and yield curves at the balance sheet date.
 
 
The fair value of over-the-counter Foreign Currency Option contracts is determined using the Black Scholes 
valuation model.
 
 
Commodity derivative contracts are valued using available information in markets and quotations from exchange, brokers 
and price index developers.
 
 
The fair value for Level 3 instruments is valued using inputs based on information about market participants assumptions 
and other data that are available.
 
 
The fair value of the remaining financial instruments is determined using discounted cash flow analysis.
 
 
All foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rate at reporting date.
 
Financial Risk Management
 
 
The Group’s activities expose it to variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign currency risk and interest rate risk), 
commodity price risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk. Within the boundaries of approved Risk Management Policy framework, 
the Group uses derivative instruments to manage the volatility of financial markets and minimise the adverse impact on its 
financial performance.
 
 
Market Risk
 
 
 
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes 
in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as 
equity price risk and commodity risk.
 
 
 
Foreign Currency Risk
 
 
 
 
Foreign Currency Risk is the risk that the Fair Value or Future Cash Flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of 
changes in foreign currency rates. Exposures can arise on account of the various assets and liabilities which are 
denominated in currencies other than Indian Rupee.
 
 
 
 
The following table shows in C crore, US Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen currency exposures on financial 
instruments at the end of the reporting period. The exposure to all other foreign currencies are not material.

ii) 
Commodity Price Risk
 
 
 
Commodity price risk arises due to fluctuation in prices of crude oil, other feed stock and products and bullion. The Group 
has a risk management framework aimed at prudently managing the risk arising from the volatility in commodity prices and 
freight costs.
 
 
 
The Group’s commodity price risk is managed centrally through well-established trading operations and control processes. 
In accordance with the risk management policy, the Group enters into various transactions using derivatives and uses overthe-counter as well as Exchange Traded Futures, Options and Swap contracts to hedge its commodity and freight exposure.
 
 
iii) 
Credit Risk
 
 
 
Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform or pay the amounts due 
causing financial loss to the Group. Credit risk arises from Group’s activities in investments, dealing in derivatives and 
receivables from customers and other financial instruments. The Group ensures that sales of products are made to 
customers with appropriate creditworthiness. Credit information is regularly shared between businesses and finance 
function, with a framework in place to quickly identify, respond and recognise cases of credit deterioration.
 
 
 
The Group has a prudent and conservative process for managing its credit risk arising in the course of its business activities. 
Credit risk across the Group, is actively managed through Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees, Parent Group Guarantees, 
advance payments, security deposits and factoring and forfaiting without recourse to Group. The Group restricts its fixed 
income investments in liquid securities carrying high credit rating.
 
 
iv) 
Liquidity Risk
 
 
 
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s inability to meet its cash flow commitments on the due date. The Group maintains 
sufficient stock of cash, marketable securities and committed credit facilities. The Group accesses global and local financial 
markets to meet its liquidity requirements. It uses a range of products and a mix of currencies to ensure efficient funding 
from across well-diversified markets and investor pools. Treasury monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s cash flow 
position and ensures that the Group is able to meet its financial obligation at all times including contingencies.
 
 
 
The Group’s liquidity is managed centrally with operating units forecasting their cash and liquidity requirements. Treasury 
pools the cash surpluses from across the different operating units and then arranges to either fund the net deficit or invest 
the net surplus in a range of short-dated, secure and liquid instruments including short-term bank deposits, money market 
funds, reverse repos and similar instruments. The portfolio of these investments is diversified to avoid concentration risk in 
any one instrument or counterparty.

Hedge Accounting
 
 
The Group’s business objective includes safe-guarding its earnings against adverse price movements of crude oil and other 
feedstock, refined products, precious metals, freight costs as well as foreign exchange and interest rates. The Group has 
adopted a structured risk management policy to hedge all these risks within an acceptable risk limit and an approved hedge 
accounting framework which allows for Fair Value and Cash Flow hedges. Hedging instruments include exchange traded 
futures and options, over-the-counter swaps, forwards and options as well as non-derivative instruments to achieve this 
objective. 
 
 
There is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments. The Group has established a 
hedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships. To test the hedge effectiveness, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative 
method and Dollar offset method.
 
 
The hedge ineffectiveness can arise from:
 
 
- Differences in the timing of the cash flows. 
 
 
- Different indexes (and accordingly different curves). 
 
 
- The counterparties’ credit risk differently impacting the fair value movements.
 
 
The table below shows the position of hedging instruments and hedged items as on the balance sheet date:

Limited) (Viacom18), Digital18 Media Private Limited (Digital18) and Star India Private Limited (SIPL) and their respective 
shareholders and creditors (“Scheme”):
 
The above Scheme was sanctioned by the Hon’ble National Company Law Tribunal, Mumbai Bench vide Order dated August 30, 2024. 
The Scheme became effective on November 14, 2024. In terms of the Scheme:
 
(a) 
The Media Operations Undertaking and the Jio Cinema Undertaking of Viacom18 were transferred on slump sale basis to 
Digital18, a wholly owned subsidiary of Viacom18 and Digital18 issued and allotted 26,95,62,52,977 fully paid-up equity shares 
of H 10 each at par;
 
(b) 
The Company invested H 11,500 crore towards subscription of 26,05,19,406 equity shares of SIPL, as a condition precedent to 
the effectiveness of the Scheme;
 
(c) 
The Media Operations Business and the Jio Cinema Business transferred from Viacom18 to Digital18 (refer (a) above) except the 
business of production and distribution of motion pictures was demerged from Digital18 into SIPL and SIPL issued and allotted to 
Viacom 18,74,61,50,236 fully paid-up equity shares of H 10 each at par (valuation of H 32,937 crore).
 
Total consideration for (b) and (c) being H 44,437 crore (H 11,500 crore + H 32,937 crore).
 
The aforesaid resulted in SIPL becoming a 63.16 % subsidiary of Reliance Industries Limited. The Group derives synergies from SIPL’s 
superior content, OTT Platform and brand recall to augment its presence in the media space. This transaction has been accounted for 
by the Group in accordance with the requirements of Ind AS 103 applicable to reverse acquisitions. Accordingly, the consideration 
issued by the Group of H 44,437 crore, has been appropriated over identifiable assets and liabilities of SIPL, being non-current and 
current assets of H 13,527 crore and H 24,866 crore respectively, non-current and current liabilities of H 679 crore and H 8,489 crore 
respectively, recognition of onerous contract of H 22,129 crore, recognition of brand of H 31,513 crore, with the balancing figure being 
goodwill of H 5,828 crore. This acquisition does not have a material impact on the consolidated revenue and consolidated profits of the 
Group for the current year.
43. Events after the Reporting Period
 
The Board of Directors have recommended dividend of H 5.5/- per fully paid up equity share of H 10/- each for the financial year 202425 aggregating H 7,443 crore.
44. The figures for the corresponding previous year have been regrouped / reclassified wherever necessary, to make them comparable.
