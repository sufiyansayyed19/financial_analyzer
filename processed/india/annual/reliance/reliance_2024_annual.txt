Chairman and Managing Director’s Statement
Dear esteemed shareholders,
India’s significance in the global economic landscape has 
enhanced mani-fold over the past decade. In this world of 
volatility and uncertainty, India is shining as a beacon of 
stability and prosperity. Robust growth across all sectors, 
fuelled by the collective ‘can do’ spirit of 1.4 billion Indians 
and bolstered by our rich heritage, is steadily driving the 
nation’s economic progress. 
With the launch of Jio 4G in 2016, we 
set out on a journey to make digital 
inclusion in India a reality. Jio turned 
a Data Dark India into a Data Rich 
nation, supplying every Indian home 
with affordable, high-speed 4G data. 
And this year, Jio has further enhanced 
the country’s digital infrastructure by 
rolling out its True5G network across 
India in world-record time. 
The launch of JioBharat phone was 
another revolutionary step towards 
bridging the country’s digital divide. 
A smartphone at the price of a 
feature phone, the JioBharat phone 
will go a long way in the realisation 
of a 2G-mukt Bharat. We are also 
making concerted efforts in building 
capabilities in evolving technologies 
such as AI/ML, AR/VR, robotics, 
natural language recognition and 
processing. The world is increasingly 
recognising India as an innovation hub, 
and Jio will continue to play a stellar 
role in building the nation’s digital 
infrastructure and capabilities.
The changing demography of India 
too is scripting our growth story. The 
working population has soared to 
~450 million, and household incomes 
are on an upward trajectory. There is 
visible improvement in the quality of 
life of common people. With increase 
in disposable income, the demand 
for goods and services is expanding 
rapidly. As India’s largest retailer, 
Reliance Retail is perfectly positioned 
to serve the consumption needs of 
our fast-growing economy. With our 
all-encompassing range of products, 
we have become an integral part of 
the lives of our consumers across the 
nation. Our New Commerce initiative 
is also playing an important role in 
supporting small indigenous merchants 
and kirana shop owners – the very 
backbone of the retail supply chain of 
our nation. 
This year we introduced our first 
‘Swadesh’ store, promoting traditional 
art forms, as well as artisans. We have 
always believed that the demand 
for India’s age-old crafts is at par 
with prominent global brands, and 
our belief has been vindicated by 
the overwhelming response to our 
Swadesh stores.
The world is now realising the 
enormous potential of India. 
‘Invest in India’ is being advocated 
globally. Reliance Retail’s vision of 
inclusive development for millions of 
consumers and merchants, coupled 
with unprecedented growth of the 
Indian marketplace, has resulted in 
marquee names investing in RRVL at 
a US$ 100 billion valuation milestone.
The Media and Entertainment business 
also made impressive progress this 
year. We believe in the potential of 
talented artistes and storytellers of our 
country and continue to promote their 
projects. To cater to the evolving tastes 
of Indian audiences, we bring together 
a blend of premium global and homegrown content through multiple 
consumption platforms. As Indians, 
we nurture a passion for sports and 
work towards making exciting sports 
content available to our viewers.
Teaming up with global media 
powerhouses, we are pooling together 
spectacular content for the Indian 
diaspora. With a package replete with 
quality media productions, sports 
events, and news platforms, we 
continue to work towards providing the 
best of news coverage, infotainment, 
and entertainment to millions 
of Indians.
Over the past couple of years, volatility 
in trade flows and supply chain 
disruptions have affected the energy 
sufficiency of multiple economies. 
With visionary and prudent leadership, 
the resilience and stability of the Indian 
economy amid such a global crisis is 
truly unparalleled. The Oil and Gas 
division of Reliance has performed 
an outstanding job in strengthening 
India’s energy security. With the 
commissioning of MJ Field, KG-D6 
block now accounts for ~30% of India’s 
domestic gas production. 
As the world’s largest single-site 
refinery operator, we continue to 
diligently work towards ensuring a 
steady supply of fuel to both India and 
offshore markets. Our fuel-retailing 
JV, Jio-bp, focuses on innovation 
and customisable indigenous 
solutions to improve fuel efficiency at 
affordable prices. Our fast-growing 
network of EV charging stations 
enable the development of a robust 
infrastructure to support the growing 
fleet of EVs in India. Moreover, it 
underscores Reliance’s commitment 
towards decarbonisation.
Leading 
India’s Inclusive 
Growth Story
Shri. Mukesh D. Ambani
Chairman and Managing Director, 

It is this spirit of India and Indians 
that inspires Reliance to innovate 
relentlessly and excel in every venture. 
It is a matter of immense pride for the 
Reliance Family to be a part of India’s 
growth story and contribute to its 
meteoric rise.

Integrated Annual Report 2023-24

Chairman and Managing Director’s Statement
Highlights of Operational 
Performance
Digital Services
Jio’s subscriber base has shot up to 
481.8 million. The pan-India rollout 
of True5G network was completed 
during the year in world-record time 
with over 108 million subscribers 
already having migrated to Jio’s True5G 
network. The launch of JioAirFiber has 
been well received by consumers. The 
introduction of JioBharat phone offers 
people who are on 2G networks an 
enriching data experience at affordable 
prices. In fact, JioBharat phone has 
already acquired 50% market share in 
the sub- C 1,000 segment.
Retail
The retail business significantly 
benefited from operating leverage, 
efficiency gains, and investments in 
technology and people. We continued 
to consolidate our leadership position 
through acquisitions and partnerships. 
We launched Tira, our omni-channel 
beauty retail platform and undertook 
rapid expansion of the platform’s 
digital and physical footprint. Our 
retail store network expanded to 
18,836 stores, taking the overall 
retail space to 79.1 million sq.ft., an 
increase of 20.6% Y-o-Y. Addition of 
newer features and channels on online 
platforms resulted in growing share of 
digital and new commerce segments 
in revenue.
The Industrial and Infrastructure 
sectors in India exhibit an exceptional 
growth trajectory. Today’s India 
employs futuristic techniques to build 
robust, reliable, and lasting solutions. 
Reliance’s petrochemical products 
continue to contribute heavily to the 
fast-paced growth of new India. The 
concept of circularity has always been 
an inherent component of our chemical 
business. With immense pride I say 
that Reliance has become the first 
Indian company to chemically recycle 
plastic waste-based pyrolysis oil into 
circular polymers. This, along with other 
pioneering initiatives such as recycled 
polyester, recycled polyolefins, and 
waste-to-road solutions, is testimony to 
Reliance’s relentless drive for greener 
products and solutions.
As we work towards our goal of 
attaining Net Carbon Zero by the 
year 2035, the development of the 
Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga 
Complex in Jamnagar is progressing 
rapidly. This giga complex will be one 
of the largest end-to-end integrated 
renewable energy manufacturing 
facilities globally. We are also exploring 
multiple technologies for capture and 
recycling of carbon. We are confident 
that our New Energy business will play 
a pivotal role in the global movement 
for adoption of cleaner fuels.
Our target is 
not just to make 
clean energy 
available, but 
also to make it 
accessible and 
affordable, thereby 
ensuring energy 
self‑sufficiency 
for India. 
Media and Entertainment
Media segment consolidated its market 
share with leadership across important 
segments. Record viewership of the 
Indian Premier League on JioCinema 
underscored our ability to scale-up 
audience on our digital platform in a 
short time. 
During the year, we entered into a 
landmark agreement with The Walt 
Disney Company, world’s leading 
media company, for creating a 
joint venture which combines the 
businesses of Viacom 18 and Star 
India. The resultant JV will be one 
of the leading television and digital 
streaming platforms in India, bringing 
best-in-class entertainment for our 
audience across the country.
Oil to Chemicals
Product cracks for transportation 
fuels remained strong albeit lower 
than the previous year. Demand 
for downstream chemicals was 
muted globally but domestic 
demand remained healthy. Despite 
the headwinds, the O2C business 
registered a resilient performance. 
Jio‑bp launched the ‘You Deserve 
More’ campaign and continued to 
expand its network of fuel retailing 
and EV charging outlets.
With such a comprehensive approach 
towards decarbonisation, our new 
energy and new materials business is 
poised to become one of the largest 
providers of green energy globally, as 
well as a prime contributor towards 
India’s 2070 net zero target.
Accelerating Towards 
Net Carbon Zero
Reliance has defined a 
comprehensive roadmap leading 
to our ambitious Net Carbon Zero 
target. We are focused on investing 
in right talent to ensure superior 
execution of our decarbonisation 
plans. Our ESG Committee is doing 
an exemplary job in reviewing and 
evaluating the Company’s progress. 
Our think-tank, the New Energy 
Council, is providing critical insights 
about utility and adoption of nascent, 
unconventional technologies.
Our R&D teams are working roundthe-clock, devising solutions that 
can leverage novel techniques in the 
carbon recycling process. 
We have a strong background of 
successfully introducing pioneering 
transformations and gaining 
leadership status across market 
segments. I am confident that 
Reliance’s arrival on the global 
renewable energy landscape too will 
be truly disruptive.
Oil and Gas Exploration 
and Production
Overall domestic production grew 
53.2% Y-o-Y to 268.6 BCFe. With 
increased production from the KG‑D6 
block, the business witnessed a 
robust EBITDA growth of 48.6% Y-o-Y. 
Exploration activities in the KG UDW1 
block and multi-lateral well campaign 
in the CBM block are underway.
Conclusion
Reliance has consolidated its balance 
sheet after the previous round of capex 
and is ready for the next level of growth. 
Our constant endeavor to find solutions 
for India and Indians has helped us spot 
multiple growth opportunities that 
have expanded our business portfolio. 
This portfolio now enables us to touch 
the lives of millions of Indians through 
multiple products and offerings. 
Two things have throughout been 
paramount for us in dealing with our 
stakeholders – relationship and trust. 
Our people are our biggest strength. 
I sincerely appreciate our Board of 
Directors for their guidance and 
oversight, as well as all our employees 
for their dedicated efforts to help the 
Company achieve new standards of 
excellence. I would like to thank our 
business partners for their consistent 
support in delivering quality solutions. 
Allow me to convey my gratitude to our 
customers for keeping faith in Brand 
Reliance over the years. 
Finally, I thank our shareholders for their 
continued support. Their faith spurs us 
to continually grow and create value.
With best wishes,

Mukesh D. Ambani 
Chairman and Managing Director

Enhancing Investor Wealth
Global optimism on the Indian 
economic and business outlook 
helped Indian equity indices to soar 
to record high levels. In February 
2024, Reliance became the first 
Indian company to cross the C 20 
lakh crore threshold in market 
capitalisation. The demerger of Jio 
Financial Services has unlocked 
significant value for shareholders. 
Enhancing investors’ wealth and 
contributing to India’s economic 
expansion inspire us to aim higher.
Summary of Financial 
Performance
I am happy to highlight the 
remarkable financial performance of 
our businesses. The global economic 
scenario remained volatile causing 
considerable headwinds. But 
strategic depth of our businesses, 
talented business teams, and 
resilient domestic markets helped 
Reliance navigate the obstacles. 
The consolidated EBITDA grew 
16.1% Y-o-Y to C 1,78,677, whereas 
consolidated net profit stood at 
C 79,020 with 7.3% Y-o-Y growth. 
Importantly, all our business 
segments contributed to the growth 
in earnings. Our strong balance 
sheet is a testament to our prudent 
business and financial management 
strategies which help us maximise 
cash profits.

statements that address expectations 
or projections about the future, but 
not limited to the Company’s strategy 
for growth, product development, 
market position, expenditures, and 
financial results, are forward-looking 
statements. Since these are based on 
certain assumptions and expectations 
of future events, the Company cannot 
guarantee that these are accurate 
or will be realised. The Company’s 
actual results, performance or

The Company disclaims any obligation

Indian Economy
India registered a GDP growth of 8.2% 
for FY24 (7.2% in FY 2022-23). India’s

amid strong domestic consumption and 
a pick-up in investment. Government 
capex registered 25%+ Y-o-Y growth. 
Inflation moderated to 4.9% Y-o-Y by 
Mar-24 from an average of 6.7% in 
FY 2022-23. Core CPI inflation fell to 
3.2% (all time low).
Current account deficit (CAD) remained 
below 1.5% of GDP and FX reserves 
above US$ 600 billion. India’s net 
services exports grew at 15%. India’s 
share in world’s services exports now 
stands at ~10%. Direct tax to GDP is at 
record high of 6.7% (vs pre-COVID at 
5.5-6%). India’s oil demand stood at 
233.3 MMT for FY24 (up 4.6% Y-o-Y). 
Demand for natural gas was at 66.6 
BCM (up 11.1% Y-o-Y).
India continues to attract robust foreign 
inflows. FY24 inflows were resilient at

to continue being the fastest growing 
major economy with growth expected 
at 6.5% for the coming two years as 
per IMF.

financial parameters. Notably, all 
segments contributed positively to 
earnings growth during the year.
The Company achieved a consolidated 
revenue of C 10,00,122 crore 
(US$ 119.9 billion), up 2.6%, as 
compared to C 9,74,864 crore in the 
previous year. Revenue was boosted 
by robust growth in retail and digital 
services business, with an increase of 
17.8% and 11.0%, respectively. 
Profit

increased by 16.1% to C 1,78,677 
crore (US$ 21.4 billion) as compared 
to C 1,53,920 crore in FY 2022‑23. 
EBITDA growth was led by 28.4% 
increase in Retail segment, benefitting 
from improved operating leverage, 
higher footfalls and growth in digital 
channels. Digital Services segment 
EBITDA also grew by 12.7% on 
account of higher revenue with 
increased subscriber base and higher 
customer engagement. O2C EBITDA 
grew marginally Y-o-Y, supported by 
strength in cracks for transportation 
fuels. Weakness in global downstream 
chemical margins and impact of major 
planned turnaround at the Jamnagar 
complex was offset by moderation 
in SAED. Oil & Gas segment EBITDA 
increased by 48.6%, supported by 
56.8% higher gas production in KG-D6 
block. Cash Profit increased by 12.7% 
to C 1,41,969 crore as compared to 
C 1,25,951 crore in the previous year.

C 1,31,769 crore (US$ 15.8 billion) 
as against C 1,41,809 crore in the 
previous year, with investments into

capacities in the Oil and Gas segment 
and projects in the O2C vertical. Capex

(US$ 68.9 billion), a marginal decrease

crore in the previous year. Standalone 
EBITDA stood at C 86,393 crore 
(US$ 10.4 billion) as against C 77,918

Integrated Annual Report 2023-24

The inventory turnover ratio 
decreased to 7.31 in FY 2023‑24 
as against 10.49 in the 
previous year primarily due to 
higher inventories.
The return on net worth* fell to 
10.3% in FY 2023-24 as against 
10.9% in previous year due to 
marginally lower profits on weak 
O2C earnings and higher taxation.
Liquidity and Capital 
Resources
Macro Environment
In FY 2023-24, global financial markets 
experienced significant volatility, 
marked by unpredictable shifts in 
sentiments, from growth concerns to 
inflation worries. In the US, it was a year 
of two halves. The first half experienced 
heightened financial market volatility 
stemming from fears of potential 
banking crisis followed by improvement 
in risk sentiment due to decisive fiscal 
interventions and decline in the US 
headline CPI inflation to 3-3.5%. The 
second half was marked by resurgence 
of inflationary and growth pressures, 
leaving markets uncertain about 
future inflationary conditions, growth 
prospects, and quantum of policy 
rate cuts.
In India inflation declined steadily, 
with headline inflation reaching 5.1% 
in 4Q FY 2023-24, and core inflation 
falling below 4%. The inclusion of Indian 
sovereign bonds into JP Morgan’s 
GBI-EM global index in 2Q FY 2023-24 
is expected to attract an estimated 
US$ 25 billion in foreign inflow. 
Additionally, the Government of India 
announced a steady fiscal consolidation 
path which helped in easing G-sec 
yields despite global challenges. 
India’s growth advantage coupled with 
expectations of sub-1.5% GDP Current 
Account Deficit, and low USDINR 
volatility should bolster the Indian 
Rupee in the short to medium term. 
RIL successfully navigated this 
environment while maintaining 
adequate liquidity, managing financial 
market risks, and delivering consistent 
returns on its investment portfolio.
Fund Raising
Despite challenging market conditions, 
RIL and its subsidiaries successfully 
raised financing across various 
markets, currencies, and financial 
products at competitive cost to 
finance capital expenditure, support 
business expansion, and refinance 
maturing debt.
Offshore Facilities
Syndicated Term Loan 
Facilities (US$ 4.45 billion 
equivalent)
US$ 2 billion equivalent facilities 
were secured by the Company 
and its subsidiary, Reliance Jio 
Infocom Limited (RJIL), to finance 
capital expenditure.
US$ 2.45 billion equivalent 
facilities were arranged to 
refinance maturing debt. This 
transaction was well-subscribed 
in the primary syndication 
market from global lenders 
across geographies.
ECA Supported Facilities 
(US$ 2.83 billion equivalent)
RJIL secured US$ 2.2 billion 
equivalent facilities to finance 
equipment and services for its 
pan-India 5G rollout comprising 
first ever Finnish Export Credit 
Agency (Finnvera) supported 
facilities of US$ 1.6 billion 
equivalent and US$ 0.6 billion 
equivalent facilities from Canadian 
Export Credit Agency (EDC).
The Company tied-up Korean 
Export Credit Agency (K-EXIM) 
supported facilities aggregating 
a US$ 625 million equivalent 
to finance the purchase of 
Floating, Production, Storage and 
Offloading (FPSO) vessel in the Oil 
& Gas business.
Onshore Facilities
RIL issued C 20,000 crore 10-year nonconvertible debentures (NCD), marking 
the largest single-tranche NCD issuance 
by a non-financial entity in Indian 
capital markets and the second largest 
issuance ever in terms of size. The NCDs 
were issued at rates which were RIL’s 
lowest coupon ever and at the tightest 
spread over sovereign credit.
Liquidity Management
RIL places a strong emphasis on 
liquidity management, to ensure that 
the Group always has an adequate 
cushion to effectively mitigate market 
disruptions and meet its short-term 
obligations. The Company effectively 
optimises borrowing costs and 
finances working capital by extending 
payables, accelerating receivables, 
and utilising various debt instruments. 
RIL’s investment strategy safeguards 
its financial resilience while optimising 
growth opportunities. The portfolio is 
continuously calibrated to balance the 
objectives of capital preservation, stable 
returns, and ready access to liquidity.
RIL remains resolute in its commitment 
to foster sustainable value for its 
stakeholders through disciplined 
capital allocation, maintain appropriate 
leverage and optimally utilise its 
resources. The Company’s focus 
will be geared towards enhancing 
resilience and agility in its response 
to evolving market conditions. RIL will 
continue to monitor financial markets 
to seize suitable opportunities for 
capital-raising to support its growth 
plans, while maintaining a sharp 
focus on financial discipline and 
risk management.

wireless networks on the back of 5G 
and point- to-multi-point UBR would 
catalyze demand for high-speed 
fixed broadband. Rural areas are 
expected to see a higher uptake of 
these services due to limited last-mile 
infrastructure currently. 
Strategic Objective 
Leverage technology to create 
market-leading products and 
solutions that add value to 
our customers, across and 
beyond India
Digital Adoption Seeing 
Significant Traction
Digital services are becoming 
increasingly integral to the 900+ 
million broadband users in India. 
Increasing per capita income, further 
strengthening of India Stack, and the 
need for convenience will continue 
to drive the adoption of digital 
platforms. Google, Temasek, and Bain 
& Company, in their report – e-Conomy 
India 2023–have estimated India’s 
internet economy to grow 6x and reach 
US$ 1 trillion by 2030.
Key Regulatory 
Developments
 
−During the year, the Government 
of India enacted the Indian 
Telecommunication Act 2023, 
which replaces, consolidates, and 
modernises the laws governing 
telecom services in the country.
 
−The Digital Personal Data Protection 
Act, 2023, has been enacted to 
protect the digital personal data 
of Indian citizens. The underlying 
implementation guidelines and 
rules are yet to be notified by 
the Government.
 
−Government of India conducted 
spectrum auctions in June 2024 for 
all the existing 4G and 5G spectrum 
bands. Jio acquired rights for 
additional spectrum in the 1800MHz 
band in Bihar and West Bengal 
increasing its spectrum footprint to 
26,801 MHz (uplink + downlink). 
 
−TRAI has also started a consultation 
process for the assignment 
of spectrum for space-based

Operating revenue of the Network18 
Group for the year grew by 49.4% Y-o-Y, 
driven by strong growth across both 
Entertainment and News segments. The 
businesses made significant investments 
during the year in scaling up its new 
verticals, Sports and Digital, which 
impacted the profitability.
News Business
Our TV Business News portfolio 
maintained its undisputed leadership 
with a 3600 coverage of everything 
related to business, finance, and 
economy. The National channels 
fortified their positions as the channels 
of choice for the audiences across the 
country. Our Regional portfolio of 14 
channels covers the entire breadth of 
the country with 1,200+ reporters 
stationed in virtually every corner of 
the nation

continued to be India’s #2 online 
news publisher with leadership in 
vernacular genre. It closed the gap 
with the leader to ~15% (from 40% 
at the beginning of the year) in terms 
Connected TVs to Lead 
Growth in Television 
Segment
India is expected to have 100 million 
Connected TVs by 2030. With the 
engagement levels on big screens 
higher than small screens, CTVs 
offer the best features of traditional 
and digital eco-system, providing 
an opportunity for brands to reach 
premium audiences in an intelligent 
fashion on the big screens. As per 
GroupM, 16% of advertising spends 
on TVs will be contributed by CTVs 
by 2026. 
Sports to be the Key 
Catalyst for Digital 
Adoption
Live sports has always been one 
of the most important genres for 
consumers across the world. Its broad 
demographic appeal and unique 
ability to reach millions of audiences 
concurrently with high engagement 
levels, ensures a consistent flow of 
traffic. Sports streaming on digital 
platforms scaled new heights last year 
as viewership records were broken 
repeatedly. With platforms innovating 
to bring in more audiences and adding 
new features to increase engagement, 
Sports will be a key driver for growth of 
digital segment.

status as India’s premier platform 
for financial news and also launched 
transaction‑based products on the 
platform including lending and fixed 
deposits. Moneycontrol Pro was 
India’s #1 paid digital news platform. 
Firstpost’s pivot as a digital-first, videofocussed brand got great traction with 
consumers, helping it cross 4 million 
subscribers on YouTube.
Entertainment Business
Digital 
JioCinema, was amongst the fastest 
growing OTT in the country, outpacing 
all competitors in terms of expansion 
and user acquisition. Powered by 
its expansive sports coverage and 
entertainment content, the platform 
established itself as the most popular 
OTT in the country. Starting the year on 
a strong footing with IPL, the platform 
set new benchmarks in terms of reach 
and engagement. JioCinema delivered 
record digital advertising revenue for 
the 16th season of IPL. It complemented 
its sports offering with a mix of digital 
exclusive shows like Bigg Boss OTT 
and other popular network shows. The 
platform also boasts of a strong English 
catalogue with content from global 
studios like HBO, NBCU and Paramount. 
Opportunities
Digital Expansion: India’s projected 
one billion connected screens by 2030 
indicate substantial growth potential, 
fuelled by increasing smartphone and 
CTV penetration.
Ad market Growth: Rising disposable 
incomes are expected to drive ad 
spends, particularly on digital medium, 
which have democratized advertising 
for SMBs.
Experiential Viewing: Digital 
platforms are revolutionising viewing 
experience with interactive features, 
boosting engagement and reshaping 
media consumption.
Threats
Technology transition: Rapid 
technological advancements may 
lead to the obsolescence of current 
content production infrastructure and 
viewing platforms.
Competition: Indian M&E sector’s 
growth potential means that it 
is expected to remain intensely 
competitive, featuring both local and 
global players.
Force Majeure: Any large natural 
disaster, pandemic like COVD-19, 
war etc. could disrupt regular 
business operations.
Challenges
Rising Costs and Fragmented 
Viewership: Intense competition 
has not only led to escalation in 
content costs, especially for sports 
and movie rights, it has also led to 
viewership fragmentation.
Macro-economic linkages: India’s ad 
market is inherently linked to macroeconomic growth, necessitating 
creation of a robust business model 
insulated from fluctuations in 
the economy.
Piracy: Despite content piracy seeing a 
significant decline, it remains a critical 
challenge in generating commensurate 
return on investments.
Strengths
India’s Biggest Media Conglomerate: 
Reliance is India’s largest media 
conglomerate comprising Network18, 
TV18, Viacom18, Jio Studios, and other 
investments, with strong positions in 
key segments.
Diverse Media Reach: With a portfolio 
of 63 TV channels, OTT platforms, 
digital news and information platforms, 
Reliance connects with consumers 
across platforms with tailored content 
spanning entertainment, news, sports, 
movies, and live events.
Global Alliances and Strong Brand 
Equity: Collaborations with global 
giants like Disney, Paramount, and 
Warner Bros. Discovery, along with 
genre-defining brands such as CNBC 
TV18 and Colors, have fortified 
Reliance’s leadership.
SCOT Analysis
TV Network
Our flagship channel, Colors, delivered 
a phenomenal performance, reaching

Industry Overview
Transportation Fuels
In FY 2023-24, the transportation 
fuel sector faced challenges related 
to geopolitics, shifts towards energy 
transition, environmental issues and 
economic concerns. Global oil demand 
rose by 2.2 mb/d to 102.4 mb/d, 
while supply increased by 1.6 mb/d 
to 102.1 mb/d. OPEC effectively 
managed oil prices through quota 
restrictions. The Brent crude oil price 
averaged US$ 83/bbl amidst volatility. 
In FY 2023‑24, global refinery crude 
throughput increased by 1.5 mb/d to 
reach 82.3 mb/d, despite volatility 
stemming from geopolitical tensions. 
Moreover, tanker markets rose due 
to longer ton-miles resulting from 
changes in trade patterns. 
During FY 2023-24, positive trends 
were observed in global demand, 
with gasoline demand increasing by 
813 kb/d, diesel demand growing 
by 272 kb/d and jet fuel demand 
surging by 1 mb/d. Future demand and 
market dynamics may be impacted by 
geopolitical tensions.
Strategic Objective 
Build Reliance as one of the 
world’s leading O2C, New Energy 
and New Materials company 
with a sustainable and circular 
business model
The domestic Electric Vehicle (EV) 
industry emerged strongly, boasting 
over 13,000 charging stations and a 
4 million EV parc, signaling significant 
growth potential. Aviation, propelled 
by the UDAN scheme, expanded with 
149 civil airports.
Polymers and Elastomers
Global ethylene demand increased by 
2% Y-o-Y to 181 MMT in CY23, while 
capacity addition of 9 MMTA resulted 
in a lower operating rate by 2%.
Global Polymer demand touched 
246 MMT in CY23, compared to 
245 MMT in CY22. PE and PP demand 
grew by 0.5% and 1% respectively, 
while PVC demand dropped by 0.6%. 
Global demand for SBR decreased 
by 6.6% in CY23, while PBR demand 
decreased by 2.5% due to subdued 
vehicle sales and inventory destocking. 
Domestic PP, PE and PVC demand 
grew by 9%, 20% and 9% respectively 
driven by infrastructure, automotive, 
e-commerce, FMCG and agriculture 
sector demand. Indian SBR and PBR 
markets expanded by 4% and 10% 
Y-o-Y, respectively, driven by robust 
OEM demand.
Intermediates and 
Polyesters
In CY23, global intermediaries 
demand rose 2% to 162 MMT amid 
crude price volatility and sluggish 
Chinese recovery. Global PX demand 
remained flat at 50 MMT in CY23, 
while supply grew by 6%, led by new 
capacity additions. PTA and MEG 
witnessed 3% growth due to higher 
downstream polyester operating 
rates. Global polyester demand 
grew by 4% to 88 MMT in CY23, 
primarily driven by recovery in Chinese 
downstream operations. 
Domestic polyester demand grew by 
4%. PET witnessed strong growth of 
13%, followed by PFY at 2%, while 
PSF demand was marginally down by 
2%. PET demand saw an uptick due to 
strategic purchasing by major brands 
in view of ICC World Cup and state 
elections. Slowdown in exports of 
polyester and downstream products 
impacted growth of staple filament.

Intermediates and 
Polyesters
In FY 2023-24, PX-Naphtha margins 
increased by 10%, surpassing the 
five-year average of US$ 303/
MT. Integrated producers like RIL 
continued to optimise production 
based on PX vs. gasoline economics. 
PTA-PX margins decreased by 14% 
due to tight PX supply and significant 
capacity expansions of PTA in China. 
MEG-Naphtha margin surged 53% 
to US$ 67/MT, driven by increased 
downstream operations and 
weaker naphtha prices. However, 
margins continue to remain weak 
due to capacity overhang and 
higher inventory.
PET margins weakened due to a 
substantial capacity increase in 
China and sluggish demand growth in 
Western countries attributed to high 
inflation. Filament and Staple margins 
were constrained by significant 
capacity expansions in China and 
subdued global market demand.

Oil to Chemicals
Key focus of the E&P business has been safe and reliable 
operations and project delivery while maximising production 
from its deepwater and Coal Bed Methane (CBM) fields. With 
commissioning of the MJ field, KG-D6 production has been 
ramped up to 30 MMSCMD, thereby contributing approximately 
30% of India’s gas production. This will significantly reduce 
the dependence on costly imported gas and bridge the gap in 
India’s energy requirements, especially in times of geopolitical 
uncertainty and constrained supply.

2023 continued to be a volatile year 
for the oil and gas industry, balancing 
the energy transition aspirations and 
energy security against a backdrop of 
heightened tensions in the Middle East 
and concerns about a global economic 
slowdown. With China’s reopening in 
the first half of 2023, the global oil 
markets were expected to support 
oil demand during the year. However, 
robust US shale supply growth, warm 
winter weather, increased renewables, 
and fast interest rate hikes forced 
OPEC+ to pare back oil production for 
18 months to firm up crude markets, 
even as geopolitics became more 
complex. The Brent crude oil price 
averaged ~US$ 83/bbl. Gas availability 
remained tight in 2023 as incremental 
global LNG production fell short 
of expectations.
Industry Overview
Revenue and EBITDA were up 48.0% and 48.6%, respectively. This was mainly 
due to higher gas and condensate production and partly offset by lower 
price realisation.

Petroleum Exploration License (PEL) 
was issued in August 2019.
Post completion of 3D Seismic 
Acquisition and Processing campaign, 
the first exploration well was drilled in 
the Block, and the drilled well data are 
under analysis.
KG Basin
KG-D6 Deepwater Production 
Update
Since the commencement of 
production, Block KG-D6 established 
several global benchmarks in terms of 
operational performance, including 
99.9% uptime and more than 13 years 
of incident-free operations.
The next wave of projects – R Cluster, 
Satellite Cluster, and MJ – have been 
commissioned and are currently under 
production. These projects have 
leveraged the hub infrastructure in 
place, thereby reducing cost.
Average production for FY 2023‑24 
from the three fields together is 
~27 MMSCMD gas and ~18,000 bbls 
per day of oil and condensate. 
Production is in line with expectations.
Based on the comprehensive 
assessment undertaken with more 
than two years of production data, 
three additional wells in R Cluster and 
one additional well in Satellite Cluster 
are being proposed to be drilled. This 
is expected to provide incremental 
recovery of ~240 BCF of gas from 
these fields.
In line with the increasing gas 
production, three rounds of e-auction 
were successfully completed. Overall, 
During the year, RIL acquired Block 
KG‑UDWHP-2022/1 (KG-UDW2) under 
the OALP VIII licensing round. The 
contract for the Block was signed in 
January 2024.
Coal Bed Methane
RIL is currently producing Coal Bed 
Methane (CBM) from its block SP 
(West)–CBM–2001/1. More than 
300 wells are in production, with an 
average output of 0.64 MMSCMD gas 
during the year.
To augment and sustain production, 
a 40 multi-lateral horizontal well 
programme is being executed in SP 
(West). This is the first time in India 
that such horizontal wells are being 
drilled for CBM. Reliance has already 
drilled 13 horizontal wells, out of 
which 10 wells are put on production. 
Preliminary results are encouraging.

Fossil fuels have historically fed 
India’s power requirements. 
Structural inefficiencies 
combined with rising costs 
of fossil fuel has resulted 
in expensive power for 
commercial and residential 
customers – average tariff of 
~ C 10/ kWh (US$ 12c/ kWh). 
Therefore, it is not feasible for 
India to keep relying on fossil 
fuels for its growth. The use 
of fossil fuels-based energy 
increases dependence on 
imports and results in drain of 
foreign exchange. 
Stable and round-the-clock 
cost-efficient green power 
is the need of the hour. India 
needs to solve this problem to 
maintain its growth trajectory 
and reach US$ 32 trillion GDP 
by 2047.
Over the next 12 months, 
our focus is to bring new 
energy manufacturing 
facilities on-stream, operate 
them efficiently and, start 
developing RE generation 
projects. Simultaneously, we 
would develop supply chain 
locally for self-sufficiency and 
reduce the reliance on imports.
We aim to be the partner 
of choice for leading global 
climate technology and 
product companies and 
develop business model which 
is flexible and adaptable to 
different technologies and 
future proofed to be always 
lowest life cycle cost and best

Integrated Approach to 
Sustainable Growth
Rooted in the conviction “What is good for India is good for Reliance,” a profound ethos of growth, care and 
access for all flows through every facet of Reliance’s initiatives, woven seamlessly into its organisational 
tapestry. Central to Reliance’s mission is its commitment to building an entity that exerts a transformative 
influence on its stakeholders — from employees and their families to customers, shareholders, investors and 
partners. This dedication extends beyond corporate borders to encompass India as a whole, as well as the 
broader global community, nurturing both people and the planet.
Capturing Reliance’s Story of Value Creation and Sustainable Growth 
As one of the world’s largest publicly 
listed companies, Reliance recognises 
its duty and commitment to all those 
associated with it. The Company, 
thus, prioritises embracing cutting 
edge technology, fostering robust 
research capabilities, creating mutually 
rewarding employee experiences, 
supporting communities, minimising 
its environmental impact and staying 
attuned to evolving customer 
preferences. By acknowledging 
the interdependencies between 
various aspects of business and the 
environment, Reliance effectively 
monitors and mitigates risks while 
identifying opportunities to maintain 
a competitive edge. With ‘Growth’, 
‘Care’ and ‘Access’ for all at its core 
and ‘Sustainability’ as its guiding 
principle, Reliance continues to 
scale heights of success, ensuring 
the inclusion of all stakeholders on 
this journey. The Integrated Report 
2023-24 aptly captures Reliance’s 
story of value creation and sustainable 
growth through the six capitals – 
Natural Capital, Human Capital,

Management Approach
Reliance firmly believes in a 
multifaceted approach to human 
capital management and has defined 
the 10 Tenets of Institutional 
Leadership, which translates this belief 
into concrete actions. The Company 
prioritises the health, safety and 
holistic well-being of employees and 
champions a diverse and inclusive 
environment where individuals from all 
backgrounds feel valued and respected. 
The Company also makes significant 
investments in talent acquisition, 
management and retention through 
its diverse initiatives. Reliance adheres 
to the principle of equal opportunity. 
Furthermore, the Company respects 
the fundamental rights of its workforce, 
such as freedom of association, speech 
Among the total employees in Reliance 
Group in the table above, 53.9% are 
below the age of 30, and 21.4% are 
female. Of the total new hires, 81.8% 
are below the age of 30, and 24.0% 
are female. Of the total voluntary 
separations, 74.9% are below the age 
of 30, and 22.7% are female.
Overall voluntary separations in 
FY2023-24 are lower than FY202223. The retail industry typically has a 
high employee turnover rate, especially 
in store operations. For Jio, 43% of 
reported attrition includes non-regular 
employees (fixed-term contracts, parttime, apprentice and interns). A shift 
towards commission-based job roles in 
the Jio workforce reduced overall need 
for new hiring in field jobs.
The average learning hours per 
employee for O2C and E&P, Jio, and 
Retail are 34.72, 40.98 and 63.97 
respectively. Over 28.80 Million

Quality Control
 
We have maintained our 
independence and confirm that 
we have met the requirements of 
the Code of Ethics issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of India (the “ICAI”) and have 
the required competencies 
and experience to conduct this

Integrated Approach to Sustainable Growth

Integrated Annual Report 2023-24

Corporate Governance Report
Our Corporate Governance practices enable inclusive growth 
and help build sustainable societal value
Between my past, the present and the future, there 
is one common factor: Relationship and Trust. 
This is the foundation of our growth.
Shri Dhirubhai H. Ambani
Founder Chairman
This report is prepared in accordance 
with the provisions of the Securities 
and Exchange Board of India 
(Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015 
(“Listing Regulations”) and the report 
contains the details of Corporate 
Governance systems and processes at 

“the Company”).
Statement on Company’s 
Philosophy on Code 
of Governance
Corporate Governance encompasses 
a set of systems and practices to 
ensure that the Company’s affairs 
are managed in a manner which 
ensures accountability, transparency 
and fairness in all transactions in the 
widest sense. The objective is to meet 
stakeholders’ aspirations and societal 
expectations. We are committed 
to meet the aspirations of all our 
stakeholders. This is demonstrated 
in shareholder returns, high credit 
ratings, awards and recognitions, 
governance processes and an 
entrepreneurial performance focused 
work environment.
The demands of Corporate Governance 
require professionals to raise their 
competence and capability levels to 
meet the expectations in managing the 
enterprise and its resources effectively 
with the highest standards of ethics.
We have a defined policy framework 
for ethical conduct of businesses. We 
believe that any business conduct 
can be ethical only when it rests on 
the six core values viz. Customer 
Value, Ownership Mindset, Respect, 
Integrity, One Team and Excellence.
We believe, our governance standards 
must be globally benchmarked. 
Therefore, we have institutionalised 
the right building blocks for future 
growth. It is our endeavour to achieve 
higher standards and provide oversight 
and guidance to the management 
in strategy implementation, risk 
management and fulfilment of stated 
goals and objectives.
We believe, Corporate Governance is 
not just a destination, but a journey to 
constantly improve sustainable value 
creation. It is an upward-moving target 
that we collectively strive towards 
achieving. Our multiple initiatives 
towards maintaining the highest 
standards of governance are detailed 
in this Report.

Respect to Commodities 
Including Through Hedging
Commodities Exposure
 
The Company is exposed to price 
volatility on various Petroleum, 
Petrochemical and other Energy 
related commodities, as part of its 
business operations. Due to the 
dynamic markets, prices of such 
Commodities fluctuate and can 
result in Margin Risk. This policy 
prescribes the guidelines for 
hedging Commodities Price risks.
Hedging Policy
 
Exposures are identified and 
measured across the Company 
so that appropriate hedging 
can be done on a net basis. For 
commodities hedging, there 
exist Over The Counter (OTC) 
and exchange markets that 
offer financial instruments 
(derivatives), that enable 
managing the Price risk.
 
Strategic decisions regarding 
the timing and the usage of 
derivatives instruments such as 
Swaps/Futures/Options are taken 
based on various factors including 
market conditions, physical 
inventories, macro-economic 
situation. These decisions and 
execution are done in line with 
the Board approved Commodities 
Risk Management Framework. 
The Risk Management Committee 
has oversight on all hedging 
actions taken.
 
More details on Risk Management 
are covered under the Enterprise 
Risk Management section of the

All the contracts/arrangements/
transactions entered by the Company 
during the financial year with related 
parties were in its ordinary course of 
business and on an arm’s length basis.
During the FY 2023-24, contracts/

Company on Materiality of Related

(ii) 
On December 16, 2010, SEBI 
issued a show cause notice (SCN), 
inter alia to the Company (RIL) in 
connection with the trades by RIL 
in the stock exchanges in 2007 in 
the shares of Reliance Petroleum 
Limited, then a subsidiary of RIL. 
Hearings were held before the 
Whole Time Member (WTM) of 
SEBI in respect of the SCN. By 
an order dated March 24, 2017, 
the WTM passed the directions: 
(i) prohibiting inter alia RIL from 
dealing in equity derivatives in 
the ‘Futures & Options’ segment 
of stock exchanges, directly or 
indirectly, for a period of one year 
from the date of the order; and 
(ii) to RIL to disgorge an amount of 
C 447.27 crore along with interest 
at the rate of 12% per annum 
from November 29, 2007 till the 
date of payment. In May 2017, 
RIL and the other noticees filed 
an appeal before the Securities 
Appellate Tribunal (SAT) against 
this order. SAT, by a majority 
order (2:1), dismissed the appeal 
on November 5, 2020 and 
directed RIL to pay the disgorged 
amount within sixty days from the 
date of the order. The appeal of 
RIL and other noticees has been 
admitted by the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court of India. By its order 
dated December 17, 2020, the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court of India 
directed RIL to deposit C 250 
crore in the Investors’ Protection 
Fund, subject to the final result 
of the appeal and stayed the 
recovery of the balance, inclusive 
of interest, pending the appeal. 
RIL has complied with the order 
dated December 17, 2020 of the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court of India.
 
In the very same matter, on 
November 21, 2017, SEBI issued 
show cause notice, inter alia, to 
RIL, asking RIL to show cause

that correct facts are reflected in 
the secretarial records. We believe 
that the processes and practices, we 
followed provide a reasonable basis for 
our opinion.

C 1,32,938 crore driven by industry 
leading subscriber growth in mobility 
and ramp-up of wireline services 
leading to better subscriber mix. 
Registered an EBITDA of C 56,697 crore 
which was on account of higher revenue 
and consistent improvement in margins.
Jio has rolled out its True5G network 
across India, with over 108 million

network. JioAirFiber services are 
now being offered in ~5,900 cities/

operating and revenue benchmarks 
across verticals. Revenue from 
operations of the Network18 Group 
for the year was at C 9,297 crore, up by 
49.4% Y-o-Y, driven by strong growth 
across all segments. Sports was the

was also announced during the year 
consolidating TV and Digital news 
assets and Moneycontrol business in 
one listed company.
Oil to Chemicals
Revenue of Oil to Chemicals for FY24 
was at C 5,64,749 crore impacted 
on account of lower product price 
realisation following 13.5% Y-o-Y decline 
in average Brent crude oil prices. This 
was partially offset by higher volumes.
EBITDA for Oil to Chemicals for FY24 
was at C 62,393 crore with optimised 
feedstock sourcing, advantageous 
ethane cracking, and lower SAED 
impact, although the margin 
environment across transportation fuel 
and downstream chemicals remained 
weak through the year.
Oil & Gas (Exploration & 
Production)
Oil & Gas segment witnessed sharp 
improvement in Revenue by 48.0% 
on a Y-o-Y basis to C 24,439 crore & 
EBITDA by 48.6% Y-o-Y to C 20,191 
crore mainly on account of higher 
gas and condensate production. This 
was partly offset by lower gas price 
realisation from KG-D6 and CBM Field.
Post commissioning of MJ field, KG-D6 
production has been ramped up to 
30 MMSCMD, thereby contributing ~ 
30% of India’s gas production. Average 
production for the year from the 
three fields together is ~27 MMSCMD 
gas and ~18,000 bbls of oil and 
condensate. Development Plan for

well campaign is being executed 
to augment production – 13 wells 
completed and 10 under production

No. Key Audit Matter
Auditor’s Response
Information Technology (IT) systems and controls over 
financial reporting
We identified IT systems and controls over financial reporting 
as a key audit matter for the Company because its financial 
accounting and reporting systems are fundamentally reliant 
on IT systems and IT controls to process significant transaction 
volumes, specifically with respect to revenue and raw material 
consumption. Also, due to such large transaction volumes 
and the increasing challenge to protect the integrity of the 
Company’s systems and data, cyber security has become 
more significant. Automated accounting procedures and 
IT environment controls, which include IT governance, IT 
general controls over program development and changes, 
access to program and data and IT operations, IT application 
controls and interfaces between IT applications, are required 
to be designed and to operate effectively to ensure accurate 
financial reporting.
Our procedures included and were not limited to the following:
 
−Assessed the complexity of the IT environment by engaging 
IT specialists and through discussion with the head of IT and 
internal audit at the Company and identified IT applications 
that are relevant to our audit.
 
−Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness 
of IT general controls over program development and changes, 
access to program and data and IT operations by engaging 
IT specialists.
 
−Performed inquiry procedures with the head of cybersecurity 
at the Company in respect of the overall security architecture 
and any key threats addressed by the Company in the 
current year.
 
−Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness 
of IT application controls in the key processes impacting 
financial reporting of the Company by engaging IT specialists.
 
−Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness 
of controls relating to data transmission through the different 
IT systems to the financial reporting systems by engaging 
IT specialists.
Information Other than the Financial 
Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
 
−The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the 
other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the Annual Report, but does 
not include the Consolidated Financial Statements, 
Standalone Financial Statements and our auditor’s 
report thereon.
 
−Our opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements 
does not cover the other information and we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
 
−In connection with our audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the 
other information is materially inconsistent with the 
Standalone Financial Statements, or our knowledge 
obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated.
 
−If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact. We 
have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management and 
Those Charged with Governance for the 
Standalone Financial Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the 
matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to 
the preparation of these Standalone Financial Statements 
that give a true and fair view of the financial position, 
financial performance including other comprehensive 
income, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company 
in accordance with the accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, including Ind AS specified under 
Section 133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes 
maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance 
with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of 
the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and 
other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate 
accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy 
and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the 
preparation and presentation of the Standalone Financial 
Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, 
management and Board of Directors is responsible for 
assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless the Board of Directors either intend to liquidate 
the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
The Company’s Board of Directors are also responsible for 
overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the 
Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes 
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted 
in accordance with SAs will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis 
of these Standalone Financial Statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
 
−Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence 
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for 
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal control.
 
−Obtain an understanding of internal financial controls 
relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under 
Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible 
for expressing our opinion on whether the Company 
has adequate internal financial controls with reference 
to Standalone Financial Statements in place and the 
operating effectiveness of such controls.
 
−Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by the management.
 
−Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use 
of the going concern basis of accounting and, based 
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions 
that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude 
that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to 
draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related 
disclosures in the Standalone Financial Statements 
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify 
our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit 
evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. 
However, future events or conditions may cause the 
Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
 
−Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the Standalone Financial Statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the Standalone Financial 
Statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the 
Standalone Financial Statements that, individually or in 
aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions 
of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the Standalone 
Financial Statements may be influenced. We consider 
quantitative materiality and qualitative factors (i) in planning 
the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results 
of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified 
misstatements in the Standalone Financial Statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal controls with 
reference to financial statements that we identify during 
our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a 
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and 
where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements of the current period and are therefore the key 
audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s 
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure 
about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, 
we determine that a matter should not be communicated 
in our report because the adverse consequences of doing 
so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.

Independent Auditor’s Report

“ANNEXURE A” 
To The Independent Auditor’s Report
(Referred to in paragraph 1(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of even date)
Report on the Internal Financial Controls 
with reference to Standalone Financial 
Statements under clause (i) of sub-section 3 
of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 
(“the Act”)
We have audited the internal financial controls with 
reference to Standalone Financial Statements of Reliance 
Industries Limited (“the Company”) which includes its 
joint operations as at 31st March, 2024 in conjunction with 
our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the 
Company for the year ended on that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal 
Financial Controls
The Company’s management is responsible for establishing 
and maintaining internal financial controls based on the 
internal control with reference to Standalone Financial 
Statements criteria established by the Company considering 
the essential components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (“ICAI”). These responsibilities include 
the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate 
internal financial controls that were operating effectively 
for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its 
business, including adherence to the Company’s policies, 
the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection 
of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the 
accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable 
financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s 
internal financial controls with reference to Standalone 
Financial Statements of the Company based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial 
Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the ICAI and the 
Standards on Auditing prescribed under Section 143(10) 
of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal 
financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial 
Statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note 
require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether adequate internal financial controls with reference 
to Standalone Financial Statements was established and 
maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all 
material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial 
controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements 
and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal 
financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial 
Statements included obtaining an understanding of internal 
financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial 
Statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed 
risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s 
judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to 
fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with 
reference to Standalone Financial Statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls 
with reference to Standalone Financial 
Statements
A company’s internal financial control with reference to 
Standalone Financial Statements is a process designed 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial 
statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s 
internal financial control with reference to Standalone 
Financial Statements includes those policies and procedures 
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, 
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are 
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures 
of the company are being made only in accordance with 
authorisations of management and directors of the 
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, 
use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a 
material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial 
Controls with reference to Standalone 
Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements, 
including the possibility of collusion or improper 
management override of controls, material misstatements 
due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial 
controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements 
to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal 
financial control with reference to Standalone Financial 
Statements may become inadequate because of changes 
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the 
policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, to the best of our information and according 
to the explanations given to us, the Company has, in all 
material respects, adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to Standalone Financial Statements and such 
internal financial controls with reference to Standalone 
Financial Statements were operating effectively as at 
31st March, 2024, based on the criteria for internal financial 
control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements 
established by the Company considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial 
Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of India.

Independent Auditor’s Report

“ANNEXURE B” 
To the Independent Auditors’ Report
(Referred to in paragraph 2, under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our Report of even date)
In terms of the information and explanations sought by us 
and given by the Company and the books of account and 
records examined by us in the normal course of audit and to 
the best of our knowledge and belief, we state that:
(i) 
(A) The Company has maintained proper 
records showing full particulars, including 
quantitative details and situation of Property, 
Plant and Equipment.
 
 
(B) The Company has maintained proper records 
showing full particulars of Intangible assets.
 
The Company has a program of verification of 
Property, Plant and Equipment so as to cover 
all the items once in every three years which, 
in our opinion, is reasonable having regard to 
the size of the Company and the nature of its 
assets. Pursuant to the program, certain items 
of Property, Plant and Equipment were due for 
verification during the year and were physically 
verified by the Management during the year. 
According to the information and explanations 
given to us, no material discrepancies were 
noticed on such verification.
 
With respect to immovable properties (other 
than properties where the Company is the lessee 
and the lease agreements are duly executed 
in favour of the Company) disclosed in the 
Standalone Financial Statements included in 
Property, Plant and Equipment, according to 
information and explanations given to us and 
based on verification of the registered sale deed/ 
Transfer deed/ Conveyance deed provided to us, 
we report that, the title deeds of such immovable 
properties are held in the name of the Company 
as at Balance Sheet date, except for leasehold 
land as disclosed in Note 1.7 to the Standalone 
Financial Statements in respect of which the 
allotment letters are received and supplementary 
agreements are entered; however, lease deeds are 
pending execution.
 
The Company has not revalued any of its Property, 
Plant and Equipment and intangible assets during 
the year.
 
No proceedings have been initiated during the 
year or are pending against the Company as at 
31st March, 2024 for holding any benami property 
under the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 
1988 and Rules made thereunder.
(ii) 
The inventories except for goods in transit 
were physically verified during the year by the 
Management at reasonable intervals. In our 
opinion and according to the information and 
explanations given to us, the coverage and the 
procedure of such verification by the Management 
is appropriate having regard to size of the 
Company and the nature of its operations. In 
respect of goods in transit, majority of the goods 
have been received subsequent to the year-end. 
No discrepancies of 10% or more in the aggregate 
for each class of inventories were noticed on such 
physical verification when compared with books 
of account.
 
According to the information and explanations 
given to us, the Company has been sanctioned 
working capital limits in excess of C 5 crore, in 
aggregate, at points of time during the year, from

In our opinion and according to information and 
explanations given to us, and as disclosed in note

the quarterly returns or statements filed by the 
Company with such banks are in agreement with 
the books of account of the Company of the

The Company has not provided advances in the 
nature of loans or security to any other entity 
during the year.
 
The investments made, guarantees provided and 
the terms and conditions of the grant of all the 
above-mentioned loans and guarantees provided

not prejudicial to the Company’s interest.
 
In respect of loans granted by the Company, 
the schedule of repayment of principal and 
payment of interest has been stipulated and the 
repayments or receipts are regular.

According to information and explanations 
given to us and based on the audit procedures 
performed, the Company has not granted loans

(xvii) The Company has not incurred cash losses during the 
financial year covered by our audit and the immediately 
preceding financial year.
(xviii) There has been no resignation of the statutory auditors 
of the Company during the year.
(xix) On the basis of the financial ratios disclosed in Note 
41 to the Standalone Financial Statements, ageing 
and expected dates of realization of financial assets 
and payment of financial liabilities, other information 
accompanying the Standalone Financial Statements 
and our knowledge of the Board of Directors and 
management plans and based on our examination of 
the evidence supporting the assumptions, nothing has 
come to our attention, which causes us to believe that 
any material uncertainty exists as on the date of the 
audit report that Company is not capable of meeting its 
liabilities existing at the date of Balance Sheet as and 
when they fall due within a period of one year from the 
Balance Sheet date. We, however, state that this is not 
an assurance as to the future viability of the Company. 
We further state that our reporting is based on the 
facts up to the date of the audit report and we neither 
give any guarantee nor any assurance that all liabilities 
falling due within a period of one year from the Balance 
Sheet date, will get discharged by the Company as and 
when they fall due.
(xx) The Company has fully spent the required amount 
towards Corporate Social responsibility (CSR) and 
there are no unspent CSR amounts for the year 
requiring a transfer to a fund specified in Schedule VII 
of the Act or special account in compliance with the 
provision of sub-section (6) of Section 135 of the Act. 
Accordingly, reporting under clause 3(xx) of the Order 
is not applicable for the year.

Over its useful life as 
technically assessed
 
 
The residual values, useful lives and methods of 
depreciation of Property, Plant and Equipment are 
reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted 
prospectively, if appropriate.
 
(c) Leases 
 
 
The Company, as a lessee, recognises a rightof-use asset and a lease liability for its leasing 
arrangements, if the contract conveys the 
right to control the use of an identified asset. 
Initially the right of use assets measured at cost 
which comprises initial cost of the lease liability 
adjusted for any lease payments made at or 
before the commencement date plus any initial 
direct costs incurred. Subsequently measured 
at cost less any accumulated depreciation/ 
amortisation, accumulated impairment losses, 
if any and adjusted for any remeasurement of the 
lease liability.
 
 
The right-of-use assets is depreciated/ amortised 
using the straight-line method from the 
commencement date over the shorter of lease 
term or useful life of right-of-use asset.
 
 
The Company measures the lease liability at the 
present value of the lease payments that are not 
paid at the commencement date of the lease. The 
lease payments are discounted using the interest 
rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be 
readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily 
determined, the Company uses incremental 
borrowing rate.
 
 
For short-term and low value leases, the 
Company recognises the lease payments as an 
operating expense on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term.
 
(d) Intangible Assets
 
 
Intangible Assets are stated at cost of acquisition 
net of recoverable taxes, trade discount and 
rebates less accumulated amortisation/depletion 
and impairment losses, if any. Such cost includes 
purchase price, borrowing costs, and any cost 
directly attributable to bringing the asset to 
its working condition for the intended use, net 
charges on foreign exchange contracts and 
adjustments arising from exchange rate variations 
attributable to the Intangible Assets. 
 
 
Other Indirect Expenses incurred relating 
to project, net of income earned during 
the project development stage prior to its 
intended use, are considered as pre-operative 
expenses and disclosed under Intangible Assets 
Under Development.
 
 
The Company assesses if useful life of an 
intangible asset is finite or indefinite. A summary 
of amortisation/depletion policies applied to the 
Company’s Intangible Assets to the extent of 
depreciable amount is as follows:
Particular
Amortisation / Depletion
Technical 
Know-How
Over the useful life of the underlying 
assets ranging from 5 years to 35 
years.
Computer 
Software
Over a period of 5 years.
Development 
Rights
W.r.t. Oil and Gas, depleted using the 
unit of production method. The cost of 
producing wells along with its related 
facilities including decommissioning 
costs are depleted in proportion of oil 
and gas production achieved vis-à-vis 
Proved Developed Reserves. The cost 
for common facilities including its 
decommissioning costs are depleted 
using Proved Reserves. With respect 
to other development rights, these are 
amortized over the period of contract.
Particular
Amortisation / Depletion
Others
In case of Jetty, the aggregate amount 
amortised to date is not less than 
the aggregate rebate availed by the 
Company.
 
 
The amortisation period and the amortisation 
method for Intangible Assets with a finite useful 
life are reviewed at each reporting date.
 
(e) Inventories
 
 
Items of inventories are measured at lower of 
cost and net realisable value after providing 
for obsolescence, if any, except in case of byproducts which are valued at net realisable value. 
 
 
Cost of finished goods, work-in-progress, raw 
materials, chemicals, stores and spares, packing 
materials, trading and other products are 
determined on weighted average basis.
 
(f) Provisions
 
 
Provisions are recognised when the Company 
has a present obligation (legal or constructive) 
as a result of a past event, it is probable that 
an outflow of resources embodying economic 
benefits will be required to settle the obligation 
and a reliable estimate can be made of the 
amount of the obligation. If the effect of the 
time value of money is material, provisions are 
discounted using a current pre-tax rate that 
reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific 
to the liability. When discounting is used, the 
increase in the provision due to the passage of 
time is recognised as a finance cost. 
 
 
Provision for Decommissioning Liability
 
 
The Company records a provision for 
decommissioning costs towards site restoration 
activity. Decommissioning costs are provided 
at the present value of future expenditure using 
a current pre-tax rate expected to be incurred 
to fulfil decommissioning obligations and are 
recognised as part of the cost of the underlying 
assets. Any change in the present value of the 
expenditure, other than unwinding of discount 
on the provision, is reflected as adjustment to 
the provision and the corresponding asset. The 
change in the provision due to the unwinding of 
discount is recognised in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss.
 
(g) Contingent Liabilities
 
 
Disclosure of contingent liability is made when 
there is a possible obligation arising from past 
events, the existence of which will be confirmed 
only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one 

Integrated Annual Report 2023-24
Notes
to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024

or more uncertain future events not wholly within 
the control of the Company or a present obligation 
that arises from past events where it is either not 
probable that an outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits will be required to settle or a 
reliable estimate of amount cannot be made.
 
(h) Current Tax and Deferred Tax
 
 
The tax expenses for the period comprise of 
current tax and deferred tax. The Company 
exercises judgment in computation of current tax 
considering the relevant rulings and reassesses 
the carrying amount of deferred tax assets at the 
end of each reporting period.
 
(i) Share Based Payments
 
 
In case of Group equity-settled share-based 
payment transactions, where the Company grants 
stock options to the employees of its subsidiaries, 
the transactions are accounted by increasing 
the cost of investment in subsidiary with a 
corresponding credit in the equity.
 
(j) Foreign Currencies Transactions and 
Translation
 
 
Exchange gains or losses on foreign currency 
borrowings taken prior to April 1, 2016 which 
are related to the acquisition or construction of 
qualifying assets are adjusted in the carrying cost 
of such assets. 
 
(k) Revenue Recognition
 
 
Revenue from contracts with customers is 
recognised when control of the goods or services 
are transferred to the customer at an amount that 
reflects the consideration entitled in exchange for 
those goods or services. The Company is generally 
the principal as it typically controls the goods or 
services before transferring them to the customer.
 
 
Revenue is measured at the amount of 
consideration which the Company expects to be 
entitled to in exchange for transferring distinct 
goods or services to a customer as specified in 
the contract, excluding amounts collected on 
behalf of third parties (for example taxes and 
duties collected on behalf of the government). 
Consideration is generally due upon satisfaction 
of performance obligations and a receivable is 
recognised when it becomes unconditional. 
 
 
Generally, the credit period varies between 
0-60 days from the shipment or delivery of 
goods or completion of services as the case may 
be. The Company provides volume rebates to 
certain customers once the quantity of products 
purchased during the period exceeds a threshold 
specified and also accrues discounts to certain 
customers based on customary business practices 
which is derived on the basis of crude price 
volatility and various market demand – supply 
situations. Consideration are determined based 
on its most likely amount. Generally, sales of 
petroleum products contain provisional pricing 
features where revenue is initially recognised 
based on provisional price. Difference between 
final settlement price and provisional price is 
recognised subsequently. 
 
(l) Financial Instruments
 
 
Financial Assets
 
 
 
Purchase and sale of Financial Assets are 
recognised using trade date accounting. 
Trade receivables that do not contain 
a significant financing component are 
measured at transaction price.
 
 
 
The Company has elected to account for its 
investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint 
venture at cost less impairment loss (if any). 
 
 
 
All other equity investments are measured 
at fair value, with value changes recognised 
in Statement of Profit and Loss, except 
for those equity investments for which 
the Company has elected to present the 
value changes in ‘Other Comprehensive 
Income’. However, dividend on such equity 
investments are recognised in Statement 
of Profit and loss when the Company’s 
right to receive payment is established. The 
investments in preference shares with the 
right to surplus assets which are in nature 
of equity in accordance with Ind AS 32 are 
treated as separate category of investment 
and measured at FVTOCI. Other Financial 
Assets are generally measured at Fair Value 
Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) except 
where the Company, based on the business 
model objectives, measures these at 
Amortized Cost or Fair Value Through Other 
Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI).
 
 
 
The Company uses ‘Expected Credit Loss’ 
(ECL) model, for evaluating impairment of 
Financial Assets other than those measured 
at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL).
 
 
 
Expected Credit Losses are measured 
through a loss allowance at an amount 
equal to: 
 
−The 12-months expected credit losses 
(expected credit losses that result from 
those default events on the financial 
instrument that are possible within 12 
months after the reporting date); or 
 
−Full lifetime expected credit losses 
(expected credit losses that result from 
all possible default events over the life of 
the financial instrument).
 
 
 
For Trade Receivables, the Company 
applies ‘simplified approach’ which requires 
expected lifetime losses to be recognised 
from initial recognition of the receivables. 
 
 
 
The Company uses historical default rates to 
determine impairment loss on the portfolio 
of trade receivables. At every reporting date 
these historical default rates are reviewed 
and changes in the forward-looking estimates 
are analysed. 
 
 
 
For other assets, the Company uses 12 
month ECL to provide for impairment loss 
where there is no significant increase in 
credit risk. If there is significant increase in 
credit risk full lifetime ECL is used. 
 
 
ii. 
Financial Liabilities
 
 
 
For trade and other payables maturing 
within one year from the balance sheet 
date, the carrying amounts are determined 
to approximate fair value due to the short 
maturity of these instruments.
 
 
iii. 
Derivative Financial Instruments and 
Hedge Accounting
 
 
 
The Company uses various derivative 
financial instruments such as interest rate 
swaps, currency swaps, forwards & options 
and commodity contracts to mitigate the 
risk of changes in interest rates, exchange 
rates and commodity prices. At the inception 
of a hedge relationship, the Company 
formally designates and documents the 
hedge relationship to which the Company 
wishes to apply hedge accounting and the 
risk management objective and strategy for 
undertaking the hedge.
 
 
 
Any gains or losses arising from changes in 
the fair value of derivatives are taken directly 
to Statement of Profit and Loss, except for 
the effective portion of cash flow hedge 
which is recognised in Other Comprehensive 
Income and later to Statement of Profit and 
Loss when the hedged item affects profit 
or loss or is treated as basis adjustment if a 
hedged forecast transaction subsequently 
results in the recognition of a Non-Financial 
Assets or Non-Financial liability. 
 
 
 
Hedges that meet the criteria for hedge 
accounting are accounted for as follows: 
 
 
 
Cash Flow Hedge
 
 
 
 
The Company designates derivative 
contracts or non-derivative Financial 
Assets/ Liabilities as hedging 
instruments to mitigate the risk of 
movement in interest rates and foreign 
exchange rates for foreign exchange 
exposure on highly probable future cash 
flows attributable to a recognised asset 
or liability or forecast cash transactions. 
 
 
 
Fair Value Hedge
 
 
 
 
The Company designates derivative 
contracts or non-derivative Financial 
Assets/Liabilities as hedging 
instruments to mitigate the risk of 
change in fair value of hedged item due 
to movement in interest rates, foreign 
exchange rates and commodity prices. 
 
 
iv. 
Offsetting 
 
 
 
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities are 
offset and the net amount is presented in 
the balance sheet when, and only when, the 
Company has a legally enforceable right to 
set off the amount and it intends, either to 
settle them on a net basis or to realise the 
asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
 
(m) Accounting for Oil and Gas Activity
 
 
Oil and Gas Joint Arrangement are in the nature 
of joint operations. Accordingly, assets and 
liabilities as well as income and expenditure are 
accounted on the basis of available information 
on a line-by-line basis with similar items in the 
Company’s Financial Statements, according to the 
participating interest of the Company.
 
 
The Company follows the Guidance Note on 
Accounting for Oil and Gas producing activities 
– Ind AS issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India for the purposes of the 
accounting. Seismic costs, geological and 
geophysical studies, petroleum exploration 
license fees and general and administration costs 
directly attributable to exploration and evaluation 
activities are expensed off. The costs incurred on 
acquisition of interest in oil and gas blocks and on 
exploration and evaluation other than those which 
are expensed off are accounted for as Intangible 
Assets Under Development. All development 
costs incurred in respect of proved reserves are 
also capitalised under Intangible Assets Under 
Development. Once a well is ready to commence 
commercial production, the costs accumulated 

Integrated Annual Report 2023-24
Notes
to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024

in Intangible Assets Under Development are 
classified as Intangible Assets corresponding 
to proved developed oil and gas reserves. The 
exploration and evaluation expenditure which 
does not result in discovery of proved oil and gas 
reserves and all cost pertaining to production are 
charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss. 
 
 
The Company uses technical estimation of 
reserves as per the Petroleum Resources 
Management System guidelines 2011 and 
standard geological and reservoir engineering 
methods. The reserve review and evaluation is 
carried out annually.
C. Critical Accounting Judgements and 
Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty
 
The preparation of the Company’s Financial Statements 
requires management to make judgement, estimates 
and assumptions that affect the reported amount 
of revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities and the 
accompanying disclosures. Uncertainty about these 
assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes 
that require a material adjustment to the carrying 
amount of assets or liabilities affected in next 
financial years.
(A) Estimation of Oil and Gas Reserves
 
The determination of the Company’s estimated oil and 
natural gas reserves requires significant judgements 
and estimates to be applied and these are regularly 
reviewed and updated. Factors such as the availability 
of geological and engineering data, reservoir 
performance data, acquisition and divestment activity, 
drilling of new wells, and commodity prices all impact 
on the determination of the Company’s estimates of 
its oil and natural gas reserves. The Company bases 
it’s proved reserves estimates on the requirement 
of reasonable certainty with rigorous technical and 
commercial assessments based on conventional 
industry practice and regulatory requirements.
 
Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are used 
to calculate depletion charges for the Company’s 
oil and gas properties. The impact of changes in 
estimated proved reserves is dealt with prospectively 
by amortising the remaining carrying value of the 
asset over the expected future production. Oil and 
natural gas reserves also have a direct impact on the 
assessment of the recoverability of asset carrying 
values reported in the Financial Statements.
 
Details on proved reserves and production both 
on product and geographical basis are provided in 
Note 35.2.
(B) Property Plant and Equipment/ Intangible 
Assets
 
Estimates are involved in determining the cost 
attributable to bringing the assets to the location and 
condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in 
the manner intended by the management. Property, 
Plant and Equipment/Intangible Assets are depreciated/
amortised over their estimated useful life, after taking 
into account estimated residual value. Management 
reviews the estimated useful life and residual values of 
the assets annually in order to determine the amount 
of depreciation/ amortisation to be recorded during 
any reporting period. The useful life and residual values 
are based on the Company’s historical experience 
with similar assets and take into account anticipated 
technological and future risks. The depreciation/
amortisation for future periods is revised if there are 
significant changes from previous estimates.
(C) Provisions
 
The timing of recognition and quantification of the 
liability (including litigations) requires the application 
of judgement to existing facts and circumstances, 
which can be subject to change. The carrying amounts 
of provisions and liabilities are reviewed regularly 
and revised to take account of changing facts 
and circumstances.
(D) Impairment of Financial and Non-Financial 
Assets
 
The impairment provisions for Financial Assets 
are based on assumptions about risk of default 
and expected cash loss rates. The Company uses 
judgement in making these assumptions and selecting 
the inputs to the impairment calculation, based on 
Company’s past history, existing market conditions as 
well as forward-looking estimates at the end of each 
reporting period.
 
In case of non-financial assets, assessment of 
impairment indicators involves consideration of 
future risks. Further, the Company estimates asset’s 
recoverable amount, which is higher of an asset’s or 
Cash Generating Units (CGU’s) fair value less costs of 
disposal and its value in use.
 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using 
pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset. In determining fair value less 
costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken 
into account, if no such transactions can be identified, 
an appropriate valuation model is used.
(E) Fair Value Measurement
 
For estimates relating to fair value of financial 
instruments refer note 38 of financial statements.

The estimates of rate of escalation in salary considered in actuarial valuation, take into account inflation, seniority, 
promotion and other relevant factors including supply and demand in the employment market. The above information is 
certified by the actuary.
 
 
 
The Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets is determined considering several applicable factors, mainly the composition 
of Plan Assets held, assessed risks, historical results of return on Plan Assets and the Company’s policy for Plan 
Assets Management.
 
 
VII) The expected contributions for Defined Benefit Plan for the next financial year will be in line with FY 2023-24.
 
 
VIII) Sensitivity Analysis
 
 
 
Significant Actuarial Assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate, expected 
salary increase and employee turnover. The sensitivity analysis below, have been determined based on reasonably 
possible changes of the assumptions occurring at end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions 
constant. The result of Sensitivity analysis is given below:

Defined benefit plans typically expose the Company to actuarial risks such as: Investment Risk, Interest Risk, Longevity 
Risk and Salary Risk.
Investment Risk
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which 
is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government 
bonds.
Interest Risk
A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability; however, this will be partially 
offset by an increase in the return on the plan's debt investments.
Longevity Risk
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best 
estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An 
increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability.
Salary Risk
The present value of the defined plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries 
of plan participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the 
plan's liability.

The reserve estimates for producing fields are revised based on the performance of producing fields and with respect to 
discovered fields, the revision are based on the revised geological and reservoir simulation studies.
 
35.3 The Government of India (GOI), disallowed certain costs which the Production Sharing Contract (PSC), relating to Block KGDWN-98/3 (KG-D6) entitles the Company to recover. The Company maintains that the Contractor is entitled to recover all of its 
costs under the terms of the PSC and there are no provisions that entitle the GOI to disallow the recovery of any Contract Cost. 
The Company referred the issue to arbitration with GOI for resolution of disputes. The demand from the GOI of $ 165 million 
(C 1,373 crore) being the Company’s share (total demand $ 247 million – C 2,060 crore) towards additional Profit Petroleum 
has been considered as contingent liability in the financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024.

Notes
to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024

 
 
In supersession of the Ministry’s Gazette notification no. 22011/3/2012-ONG.D.V. dated 10th January, 2014, the GOI 
notified the New Domestic Natural Gas Pricing Guidelines, 2014 on 26th October, 2014. The GOI had directed the Company to 
instruct customers to deposit differential revenue on gas sales from D1D3 field on account of the prices determined under the 
guidelines converted to NCV basis and the prevailing price prior to 1st November, 2014 ($ 4.205 per MMBTU) to be credited 
to the gas pool account maintained by GAIL (India) Limited. The amount so deposited by customer to Gas Pool Account is C 295 
crore (net) as at 31st March, 2024. Revenue has been recognized at the GOI notified prices on GCV basis, in respect of gas 
quantities sold from D1D3 field from 1st November, 2014. This amount in the Gas Pool Account has also been challenged under 
cost recovery arbitration and is pending adjudication. 
 
35.4 (a) 
The Government of India (GOI) sent a notice to the KG-D6 Contractor on 4th November, 2016 asking the Contractor to 
deposit approximately US $1.55 billion on account of alleged gas migration from ONGC’s blocks. RIL, as Operator, for 
and on behalf of all constituents of the Contractor, initiated arbitration proceedings against the GOI contesting its unfair 
claim. The Arbitral Tribunal vide its Final Award dated 24th July, 2018 upheld Contractor’s claims. GOI filed an Appeal 
on 15th November, 2018 before the Single Judge Bench of Hon’ble Delhi High Court (DHC), against the Final Award. 
Vide Judgment dated 9th May, 2023 the Hon’ble Single Judge of DHC upheld the Arbitration Award and dismissed GOI’s 
appeal challenging the Award. An appeal was filed by GOI before the Division Bench of DHC to set aside single judge’s 
judgment which is presently sub-judice.
 
 
(b) 
Arbitration was initiated by BG Exploration and Production India Limited and the Company (together the Claimants) 
against GOI under the PSCs for Panna – Mukta and Tapti blocks due to difference in interpretation of certain 
PSC provisions between Claimants and GOI. The Arbitration Tribunal has issued a number of final partial awards in this 
matter, some of which have (in part) not been in Claimant’s favour. The arbitration is ongoing and a final award is yet to be 
issued. The arbitration has also led to satellite litigation in India (presently ongoing) and in the UK, which has resulted in 
court judgments that have not always been entirely in RIL’s favour.
 
 
(c) 
NTPC filed suit in 2006 for specific performance of contract for supply of natural gas of 132 trillion BTU annually for a 
period of 17 years. This suit is still pending adjudication in the Bombay High Court and the Company’s fact witnesses in 
the suit are to be cross examined by NTPC.
 
 
Considering the complexity of above issues, we represent that, the Company is of the view that any attempt for quantification 
of possible exposure to the Company will have an effect of prejudicing Company’s legal position in the ongoing arbitration/ 
litigations. Moreover, the Company considers above demand/disputes as remote.

(III) The Income-Tax Assessments of the Company have been completed up to Assessment Year 2021-22. The total outstanding demand 
is C 156 crore as on date. Based on the decisions of the Appellate authorities and the interpretations of other relevant provisions of 
the Income tax Act, 1961, the Company has been legally advised that the demand raised is likely to be either deleted or substantially 
reduced and accordingly no provision is considered necessary.
(IV) On December 16, 2010, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) issued a show cause notice (“SCN”) inter alia to the 
Company (RIL) in connection with the trades by RIL in the stock exchanges in 2007 in the shares of Reliance Petroleum Limited, 
then a subsidiary of RIL. By an order dated March 24, 2017, the Whole Time Member (“WTM”) passed directions: (i) prohibiting 
inter alia RIL from dealing in equity derivatives in the ‘Futures & Options’ segment of stock exchanges, directly or indirectly, for a 
period of one year from the date of the order; and (ii) to disgorge from RIL an amount of C 447 crore along with interest at the rate 
of 12% per annum from November 29, 2007, till the date of payment. On an appeal by RIL, Securities Appellate Tribunal (“SAT”) 
by a majority order (2:1), dismissed the appeal on November 5, 2020, and directed RIL to pay the disgorged amount within sixty 
days from the date of the order. The appeal of RIL and others has been admitted by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India. By its order 
dated December 17, 2020, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India directed RIL to deposit C 250 crore in the Investors’ Protection Fund, 
subject to the final result of the appeal and stayed the recovery of the balance, inclusive of interest, pending the appeal. RIL has 
complied with the order dated December 17, 2020, of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India.
 
In the above matter, the adjudicating officer of SEBI (“AO”) while adjudicating the show cause notice dated November 21, 2017 
issued, inter alia, to RIL passed an order on January 1, 2021 imposing a penalty of C 25 crore on RIL which has been paid under 
protest. In the appeal filed by RIL, the Hon’ble Securities Appellate Tribunal vide order dated December 4, 2023, did not interfere 
with the order passed by the AO since the matter was already covered by its earlier decision dated November 5, 2020, which is in 
appeal by RIL before the Hon’ble Supreme Court. RIL has filed an appeal in the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India against Order dated 
December 4, 2023 of SAT.

The financial instruments are categorised into three levels based on the inputs used to arrive at fair value measurements as 
described below:
 
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
 
Level 2: Inputs other than the quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or 
indirectly; and
 
Level 3: Inputs based on unobservable market data.
 
Valuation Methodology
 
All financial instruments are initially recognised and subsequently re-measured at fair value as described below:
 
The fair value of investment in quoted Equity Shares, Bonds, Government Securities, Treasury Bills, Certificate of Deposit and 
Mutual Funds is measured at quoted price or NAV.
 
The fair value of Interest Rate Swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable 
yield curves.
 
The fair value of Forward Foreign Exchange contracts and Currency Swaps is determined using observable forward exchange 
rates and yield curves at the balance sheet date.

Notes
to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024

 
The fair value of over-the-counter Foreign Currency Option contracts is determined using the Black Scholes valuation model.
 
Commodity derivative contracts are valued using available information in markets and quotations from exchange, brokers and 
price index developers.
 
The fair value for level 3 instruments is valued using inputs based on information about market participants assumptions and 
other data that are available.
 
The fair value of the remaining financial instruments is determined using discounted cash flow analysis.
 
All foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rate at reporting date.
Financial Risk Management
 
The Company’s activities expose it to variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign currency risk and interest rate risk), 
commodity price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. Within the boundaries of approved Risk Management Policy framework, 
the Company uses derivative instruments to manage the volatility of financial markets and minimize the adverse impact on its 
financial performance. 
 
Market Risk
 
 
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in 
market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as equity 
price risk and commodity risk.
 
 
Foreign Currency Risk
 
 
 
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the Fair Value or Future Cash Flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes 
in foreign currency rates. Exposures can arise on account of the various assets and liabilities which are denominated in 
currencies other than Indian Rupee.
 
 
 
The following table shows foreign currency exposures in US Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen on financial instruments at the 
end of the reporting period. The exposure to all other foreign currencies are not material.

Commodity Price Risk
 
 
Commodity price risk arises due to fluctuation in prices of crude oil, other feed stock and products. The Company has a risk 
management framework aimed at prudently managing the risk arising from the volatility in commodity prices and freight costs. 
 
 
The Company’s commodity risk is managed centrally through well-established trading operations and control processes. In 
accordance with the risk management policy, the Company enters into various transactions using derivatives and uses over-thecounter as well as Exchange Traded Futures, Options and Swap contracts to hedge its commodity and freight exposure.
 
iii) 
Credit Risk
 
 
Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform or pay the amounts due causing 
financial loss to the Company. Credit risk arises from Company’s activities in investments, dealing in derivatives and receivables 
from customers. The Company ensure that sales of products are made to customers with appropriate creditworthiness. 
Investment and other market exposures are managed against counterparty exposure limits. Credit information is regularly 
shared between businesses and finance function, with a framework in place to quickly identify and respond to cases of 
credit deterioration. 

Integrated Annual Report 2023-24
Notes
to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024

 
 
The Company has a prudent and conservative process for managing its credit risk arising in the course of its business activities. 
Credit risk is actively managed through Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees, Parent company Guarantees, advance payments 
and factoring & forfaiting without recourse to the Company to avoid concentration of risk. The Company restricts its fixed 
income investments to liquid securities carrying high credit rating.
 
iv) 
Liquidity Risk
 
 
Liquidity risk arises from the Company’s inability to meet its cash flow commitments on the due date. The Company maintains 
sufficient stock of cash, marketable securities and committed credit facilities. The Company accesses global and local financial 
markets to meet its liquidity requirements. It uses a range of products and a mix of currencies to ensure efficient funding from 
across well-diversified markets and investor pools. Treasury monitors rolling forecasts of the Company’s cash flow position and 
ensures that the Company is able to meet its financial obligation at all times including contingencies.
 
 
The Company’s liquidity is managed centrally with operating units forecasting their cash and liquidity requirements. Treasury 
pools the cash surpluses from across the different operating units and then arranges to either fund the net deficit or invest the 
net surplus in a range of short-dated, secure and liquid instruments including short-term bank deposits, money market funds, 
reverse repos and similar instruments. The portfolio of these investments is diversified to avoid concentration risk in any one 
instrument or counterparty.

Hedge Accounting
 
The Company’s business objective includes safe-guarding its earnings against adverse price movements of crude oil and other 
feedstock, refined products, freight costs as well as foreign exchange and interest rates. The Company has adopted a structured 
risk management policy to hedge all these risks within an acceptable risk limit and an approved hedge accounting framework which 
allows for Fair Value and Cash Flow hedges. Hedging instruments include exchange traded futures and options, over-the-counter 
swaps, forwards and options as well as non-derivative instruments to achieve this objective.
 
There is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments. The Company has established a hedge 
ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships. To test the hedge effectiveness, the Company uses the Dollar Offset method and critical 
term matching method.
 
The hedge ineffectiveness can arise from:
 
- Differences in the timing of the cash flows. 
 
- Different indexes (and accordingly different curves). 
 
- The counterparties’ credit risk differently impacting the fair value movements.

To The Members of Reliance Industries Limited
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Financial 
Statements of Reliance Industries Limited (“the Parent”) 
which includes its joint operations and its subsidiaries 
(the Parent and its subsidiaries together referred to as 
“the Group”), and the Group’s share of profit / loss in 
its associates and joint ventures, which comprise the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31st March, 2024, and 
the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss (including 
Other Comprehensive Income), the Consolidated 
Statement of Cash Flow and the Consolidated Statement 
of Changes in Equity for the year ended on that date, and 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, including 
a summary of material accounting policies and other 
explanatory information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and 
according to the explanations given to us, and based on the 
consideration of reports of the other auditors on separate /
consolidated financial statements / financial information 
of the subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures referred 
to in the Other Matters section below, the aforesaid 
Consolidated Financial Statements give the information 
required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in 
the manner so required and give a true and fair view in 
conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed 
under Section 133 of the Act read with the Companies 
(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended 
(‘Ind AS’), and other accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of 
the Group as at 31st March, 2024, and their consolidated 
profit, their consolidated total comprehensive income, their 
consolidated cash flows and their consolidated changes in 
equity for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing 
(SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our 
responsibilities under those Standards are further 
described in the Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the Group, its associates and joint 
ventures in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by 
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) 
together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to 
our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements under 
the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, 
and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code 
of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by 
us and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in 
terms of their reports referred to in the sub-paragraphs (a) 
and (b) of the Other Matters section below, is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements of the current period. 
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole, and 
in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the 
matters described below to be the key audit matters to be 
communicated in our report.

for various complex matters with the Government of India and 
other parties, continuing from earlier years, which are as under:

with the in-house legal expert and external legal opinions 
obtained by the Parent (where considered necessary) on both, 
the probability of success in the aforesaid cases, and the 
magnitude of any potential loss.

1992 in connection with trades by the Parent in the stock 
exchanges in 2007 in the shares of Reliance Petroleum

appeal has been filed with the Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
India which is pending.
 
Refer Note 35 (III) to the Consolidated Financial

counsel involved in the process.

crore in Equity and Preference Shares of Jio Digital Fibre Private 
Limited (‘JDFPL’) which are measured at fair value as per Ind AS 
109 read with Ind AS 113.
These investments are Level 3 investments as per the fair value 
hierarchy in Ind AS 113 and accordingly determination of fair 
value is based on a high degree of judgement and input from 
data that is not directly observable in the market. Further, the 
fair value is significantly influenced by the expected pattern of 
future benefits of the tangible assets of JDFPL (fibre assets).
Accordingly, it has been considered as a key audit matter.

No. Key Audit Matter
Auditor’s Response
3. Revenue Recognition
(a) 
The auditors of Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited (‘RJIL’), 
a step-down subsidiary of the Parent, have reported 
revenue recognition as a key audit matter due to the high 
volumes of data processed by the IT systems and the 
complexity of those IT systems.
In respect of the key audit matter reported to us by the auditors of 
RJIL, we performed inquiry of the audit procedures performed by 
them to address the key audit matter. As reported by the subsidiary 
auditors, the audit procedures performed by them included and 
were not limited to the following:
 
−Evaluated and tested the design, implementation and 
operating effectiveness of the relevant business process 
controls, inter-alia controls over the capture, measurement 
and authorisation of revenue transactions, involving internal 
Information Technology (IT) specialists for the automated 
controls, interface controls and reports generated through 
various relevant IT systems involved in the revenue process.
 
−Involved internal IT specialists and tested the IT environment 
inter-alia for access controls, change management and 
application specific controls in the IT Systems over RJIL’s billing 
and other relevant support systems.
 
−Tested collections and the reconciliation between revenue 
per the billing system and the financial records. Performed 
procedures to test the computation of revenue and 
deferred revenue.
(b) 
The auditors of Reliance Retail Ventures Limited (‘RRVL’), 
a subsidiary of the Parent, have reported revenue 
recognition as a key audit matter at its subsidiary 
viz., Reliance Retail Limited (‘RRL’). RRL is engaged in 
organised retail and the trading transactions generating 
revenue comprising of high volume of individually small 
transactions which increases the risk of revenue being 
recognised inappropriately and which highlights the 
criticality of sound internal processes of summarising 
and recording sales. RRL trades in various consumption 
baskets on a principal basis and recognises full value of 
consideration as its revenue. The revenue is recognised 
on transfer of control of traded goods to the customers. 
Transfer of control coincides with collection of cash or 
cash equivalent from customers. In view of the above 
and since revenue is a key performance indicator for RRL, 
revenue recognition is identified as a key audit matter.
In respect of the key audit matter reported to us by the auditors of 
RRVL, we performed inquiry of the audit procedure performed by 
them to address the key audit matter. As reported by the subsidiary 
auditors, the audit procedures performed by them included and 
were not limited to the following:
 
−Obtained understanding of the process followed by the 
management to record the revenue from each store.
 
−Evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of 
the internal controls established by RRL over reconciliation of 
revenue recorded with underlying collection made by RRL.
 
−Involved information technology specialist to test the 
automated controls and reports involved in the reconciliation 
of revenue.
 
−On a test-check basis, selected samples of stores on various 
dates. For such selections, obtained details of revenue 
recorded through various modes of payment from RRL’s 
accounting system. Reconciled revenue recorded as per such 
details with the underlying collection made by RRL as per 
cash receipts, merchant payment reports, and other third 
party supporting.
4. Information Technology (IT) systems and controls over 
financial reporting
We identified IT systems and controls over financial reporting 
as a key audit matter for the Parent because its financial 
accounting and reporting systems are fundamentally reliant 
on IT systems and IT controls to process significant transaction 
volumes, specifically with respect to revenue and raw material 
consumption. Also, due to such large transaction volumes and 
the increasing challenge to protect the integrity of the Parent’s 
systems and data, cyber security has become more significant. 
Automated accounting procedures and IT environment controls, 
which include IT governance, IT general controls over program 
development and changes, access to program and data and
Our procedures included and were not limited to the following:
 
−Assessed the complexity of the IT environment by engaging 
IT specialists and through discussion with the head of IT and 
internal audit at the Parent and identified IT applications that 
are relevant to our audit.
 
−Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness 
of IT general controls over program development and changes, 
access to program and data and IT operations by engaging 
IT specialists.
Sr. 
No. Key Audit Matter
Auditor’s Response
IT operations, IT application controls and interfaces between 
IT applications, are required to be designed and to operate 
effectively to ensure accurate financial reporting.
 
−Performed inquiry procedures with the head of cyber security 
at the Parent in respect of the overall security architecture and 
any key threats addressed by the Parent in the current year.
 
−Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness 
of IT application controls in the key processes impacting 
financial reporting of the Parent by engaging IT specialists.
 
−Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness 
of controls relating to data transmission through the different 
IT systems to the financial reporting systems by engaging 
IT specialists.
Information Other than the Financial 
Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
 
−The Parent’s Board of Directors is responsible for the 
other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the Annual Report, but does 
not include the Consolidated Financial Statements, 
Standalone Financial Statements and our auditor’s 
report thereon.
 
−Our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
does not cover the other information and we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
 
−In connection with our audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read 
the other information, compare with the financial 
statements / financial information of the joint 
operations, subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates 
audited by the other auditors, to the extent it relates 
to these entities and, in doing so, place reliance on the 
work of the other auditors and consider whether the 
other information is materially inconsistent with the 
Consolidated Financial Statements or our knowledge 
obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated. Other information 
so far as it relates to the joint operations, subsidiaries, 
joint ventures and associates, is traced from their 
financial statements / financial information audited by 
the other auditors.
 
−If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact. We 
have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management and 
Those Charged with Governance for the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
The Parent’s Board of Directors is responsible for the 
matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to 
the preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements 
that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial 
position, consolidated financial performance including 
other comprehensive income, consolidated cash flows 
and consolidated changes in equity of the Group including 
its associates and joint ventures in accordance with the 
accounting principles generally accepted in India including 
Ind AS specified under Section 133 of the Act. The 
respective Board of Directors of the companies included 
in the Group and of its associates and joint ventures are 
responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting 
records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group and its associates 
and its joint ventures and for preventing and detecting 
frauds and other irregularities; selection and application 
of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and 
estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls, that were operating effectively for 
ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting 
records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the 
financial statements that give a true and fair view and are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation 
of the Consolidated Financial Statements by the Directors of 
the Parent, as aforesaid.
In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the 
respective Management and Board of Directors of the 
companies included in the Group and of its associates 
and joint ventures are responsible for assessing the ability 
of the respective entities to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern 
and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
respective Board of Directors either intend to liquidate their 
respective entities or to cease operations, or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included 
in the Group and of its associates and joint ventures are also 
responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of 
the Group and of its associates and joint ventures.
Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the Consolidated Financial Statements as a 

Integrated Annual Report 2023-24
Independent Auditor’s Report

whole are free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that 
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted 
in accordance with SAs will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis 
of these Consolidated Financial Statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
 
−Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence 
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for 
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal control.
 
−Obtain an understanding of internal financial controls 
relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under 
Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible 
for expressing our opinion on whether the Parent has 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to 
Consolidated Financial Statements in place and the 
operating effectiveness of such controls.
 
−Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by the management.
 
−Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use 
of the going concern basis of accounting and, based 
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions 
that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the 
Group and its associates and joint ventures to continue 
as a going concern. If we conclude that a material 
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention 
in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in 
the Consolidated Financial Statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained 
up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future 
events or conditions may cause the Group and its 
associates and joint ventures to cease to continue as a 
going concern.
 
−Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the 
disclosures, and whether the Consolidated Financial 
Statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
 
−Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding 
the financial information of the entities or business 
activities within the Group and its associates and joint 
ventures to express an opinion on the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. We are responsible for the 
direction, supervision and performance of the audit of 
the financial statements of such entities or business 
activities included in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements of which we are the independent auditors. 
For the other entities or business activities included 
in the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have 
been audited by the other auditors, such other auditors 
remain responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the audits carried out by them. We 
remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements that, individually or in 
aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions 
of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements may be influenced. We consider 
quantitative materiality and qualitative factors (i) in planning 
the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results 
of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified 
misstatements in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance 
of the Parent and such other entities included in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements of which we are the 
independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit 
findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a 
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and 
where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements of the current period and are therefore the key 
audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s 
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure 
about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, 
we determine that a matter should not be communicated 
in our report because the adverse consequences of doing 
so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.

Independent Auditor’s Report

Report on the Internal Financial Controls 
with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements under Clause (i) of Sub-section 
3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 
2013 (“the Act”)
In conjunction with our audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements of Reliance Industries Limited (hereinafter 
referred to as the “Parent”) as at and for the year ended 
31st March, 2024, we have audited the internal financial 
controls with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements of the Parent and its subsidiary companies, its 
associate companies and joint venture companies, which 
are companies incorporated in India, as of that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal 
Financial Controls
The respective Board of Directors of the Parent, its 
subsidiary companies, its associate companies and joint 
venture companies, which are companies incorporated 
in India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining 
internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements based on the internal control with 
reference to Consolidated Financial Statements criteria 
established by the respective Companies considering the 
essential components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (ICAI). These responsibilities include 
the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate 
internal financial controls that were operating effectively for 
ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, 
including adherence to the respective company’s policies, 
the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection 
of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the 
accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable 
financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal 
financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements of the Parent, its subsidiary companies, its 
associate companies and its joint venture companies, which 
are companies incorporated in India, based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial 
Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the ICAI and the 
Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) 
of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal 
financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note 
require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether adequate internal financial controls with reference 
to Consolidated Financial Statements was established and 
maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all 
material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial 
controls with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of 
internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements included obtaining an understanding 
of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements, assessing the risk that a material 
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design 
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on 
the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the 
auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks 
of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and 
the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors of the 
subsidiary companies, associate companies and joint 
venture companies, which are companies incorporated 
in India, in terms of their reports referred to in the Other 
Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal 
financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements of the Parent, its subsidiary companies, its 
associate companies and its joint venture companies, which 
are companies incorporated in India.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls 
with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements
A company’s internal financial control with reference to 
Consolidated Financial Statements is a process designed 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial 
statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s 
internal financial control with reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements includes those policies and procedures 
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, 
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are 
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with generally accepted 
Rules, 2014 on preservation of audit trail as 
per the statutory requirements for record 
retention is not applicable for the year ended 
31st March, 2024.
As required by the Companies (Auditor’s Report) Order, 
2020 (“the Order”) issued by the Central Government 
of India in terms of Section 143(11) of the Act, we 
give in the “Annexure B” a statement on the matters 
specified in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Order, to the 
extent applicable.

of the company are being made only in accordance with 
authorisations of management and directors of the 
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, 
use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial 
Controls with reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial 
controls with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements, including the possibility of collusion or 
improper management override of controls, material 
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be 
detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal 
financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the 
internal financial control with reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements may become inadequate because of 
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with 
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion to the best of our information and according 
to the explanations given to us and based on the 
consideration of the reports of the other auditors referred 
to in the Other Matters paragraph below, the Parent, 
its subsidiary companies, associate companies and joint 
venture companies, which are companies incorporated in 
India, have, in all material respects, an adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements and such internal financial controls with 
reference to Consolidated Financial Statements were 
operating effectively as at 31st March, 2024, based on 
the criteria for internal financial control with reference 
to Consolidated Financial Statements established by the 
respective companies considering the essential components 
of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of 
Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.
Other Matters

on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the 
internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements insofar as it relates to 102 subsidiary 
companies, 32 associate companies and 12 joint venture 
companies, which are companies incorporated in India, is 
based solely on the corresponding reports of the auditors of 
such companies incorporated in India.

above matters.

B.3 Summary of Material Accounting Policies

(b) Business Combination
 
 
For each business combination, the Group elects 
whether to measure the non-controlling interests 
in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate 
share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
 
(c) Property, Plant and Equipment
 
 
Property, Plant and Equipment are stated at 
cost, net of recoverable taxes, trade discount 
and rebate less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment loss, if any. Such cost includes 
purchase price, borrowing cost and any cost 
directly attributable to bringing the assets to 
its working condition for its intended use, net 
charges on foreign exchange contracts and 
adjustments arising from exchange rate variations 
attributable to the assets. In case of land the 
Group has availed fair value as deemed cost on 
the date of transition to Ind AS. 
 
 
Other Indirect Expenses incurred relating to

development stage prior to its intended use, 
are considered as pre-operative expenses and 
disclosed under Capital Work-in-Progress.
 
 
Depreciation on Property, Plant and Equipment 
is provided using written down value method 
on depreciable amount except in case of certain 
assets of Oil to Chemicals and Other Segment,

Depreciation is provided based on useful life of 
the assets as prescribed in Schedule II to the 
Companies Act, 2013 except in respect of the 
following assets, where useful life is as under:
Particular
Depreciation
Fixed Bed Catalyst (useful 
life: 2 years or more)
Over its useful life as 
technically assessed
Fixed Bed Catalyst (useful 
life: up to 2 years)
100% depreciated in the 
year of addition
Premium on Leasehold Land 
(range up to 99 years)
Over the period of lease 
term
Plant and Machinery (useful 
life: 25 to 50 years)
Over its useful life as

The residual values, useful lives and methods of 
depreciation of Property, Plant and Equipment are 
reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted 
prospectively, if appropriate. 
 
(d) Leases
 
 
The Group, as a lessee, recognises a right-ofuse asset and a lease liability for its leasing 
arrangements, if the contract conveys the 
right to control the use of an identified asset. 
Initially the right of use assets measured at cost 
which comprises initial cost of the lease liability 
adjusted for any lease payments made at or 
before the commencement date plus any initial 
direct costs incurred. Subsequently measured 
at cost less any accumulated depreciation/ 
amortisation, accumulated impairment losses, if 
any and adjusted for any remeasurement of the 
lease liability.
 
 
The right-of-use assets is depreciated/ amortised 
using the straight-line method from the 
commencement date over the shorter of lease 
term or useful life of right-of-use asset.
 
 
The Group measures the lease liability at the 
present value of the lease payments that are not 
paid at the commencement date of the lease. 
The lease payments are discounted using the 
interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can 
be readily determined. If that rate cannot be 
readily determined, the Group uses incremental 
borrowing rate.
 
 
For short-term and low value leases, the Group 
recognises the lease payments as an operating 
expense on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term.
 
(e) Intangible Assets
 
 
Intangible Assets are stated at cost of acquisition 
net of recoverable taxes, trade discount and 
rebate less accumulated amortisation / depletion 
and impairment loss, if any. Such cost includes 
purchase price, borrowing costs, and any cost 
directly attributable to bringing the asset to 
its working condition for the intended use, net 
charges on foreign exchange contracts and 
adjustments arising from exchange rate variations 
attributable to the Intangible Assets.
 
 
Other Indirect Expenses incurred relating 
to project, net of income earned during 
the project development stage prior to its 
intended use, are considered as pre-operative 
expenses and disclosed under Intangible Assets 
Under Development.
 
 
The Group assesses if useful life of an intangible 
asset is finite or indefinite.
 
 
A summary of the amortisation / depletion policies 
applied to the Group’s Intangible Assets with a 
finite life to the extent of depreciable amount is 
as follows.
Particulars
Amortization
Technical 
Know-How
Over the useful life of the underlying 
assets ranging from 5 years to 35 years
Computer 
Software
Over a period of 5 to 10 years.
Development 
Rights
With respect to Oil and Gas, depleted 
using the unit of production method. 
The cost of producing wells along 
with its related facilities including 
decommissioning costs are depleted 
in proportion of oil and gas production 
achieved vis-à-vis Proved Developed 
Reserves. The cost for common facilities 
including its decommissioning costs are 
depleted using Proved Reserves. With 
respect to other development rights, 
these are amortized over the period of 
contract.
License Fee
Amortised over the remainder of 
the license period from the date of 
commencement of the commercial 
operation.

Integrated Annual Report 2023-24
Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024

Particulars
Amortization
Spectrum 
Fees
Amortised from the date of 
commencement of commercial 
operation over the balance validity 
period, based on the expected pattern 
of consumption of the expected future 
economic benefits, in accordance with 
the applicable Accounting Standards.
Others
In case of Jetty, the aggregate amount 
amortised to date is not less than the 
aggregate rebate availed by the Group. 
In case of Platforms and related Product 
Developments, over a period ranging 
from 5 to 25 years.
 
 
The amortisation period and the amortisation 
method for Intangible Assets with a finite useful 
life are reviewed at each reporting date.
 
(f) Inventories
 
 
Items of inventories are measured at lower of 
cost and net realisable value after providing 
for obsolescence, if any, except in case of byproducts which are valued at net realisable value. 
 
 
Cost of finished goods, work-in-progress, raw 
materials, chemicals, stores and spares, packing 
materials, trading and other products are 
determined on weighted average basis.
 
(g) Provisions
 
 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has 
a present obligation (legal or constructive) as 
a result of a past event, it is probable that an 
outflow of resources embodying economic 
benefits will be required to settle the obligation 
and a reliable estimate can be made of the 
amount of the obligation. If the effect of the 
time value of money is material, provisions are 
discounted using a current pre-tax rate that 
reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific 
to the liability. When discounting is used, the 
increase in the provision due to the passage of 
time is recognised as a finance cost. 
 
 
Provision for Decommissioning Liability
 
 
The Group records a provision for 
decommissioning costs towards site restoration 
activity. Decommissioning costs are provided 
at the present value of future expenditure using 
a current pre-tax rate expected to be incurred 
to fulfil decommissioning obligations and are 
recognised as part of the cost of the underlying 
assets. Any change in the present value of the 
expenditure, other than unwinding of discount 
on the provision, is reflected as adjustment to 
the provision and the corresponding asset. The 
change in the provision due to the unwinding 
of discount is recognised in the Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
 
(h) Contingent Liabilities
 
 
Disclosure of contingent liability is made when 
there is a possible obligation arising from past 
events, the existence of which will be confirmed 
only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one 
or more uncertain future events not wholly within 
the control of the Group or a present obligation 
that arises from past events where it is either not 
probable that an outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits will be required to settle or a 
reliable estimate of amount cannot be made. 
 
(i) Current Tax and Deferred Tax 
 
 
The tax expenses for the period comprise 
of current tax and deferred tax. The Group 
exercises judgment in computation of current tax 
considering the relevant rulings and reassesses 
the carrying amount of deferred tax assets / 
liabilities at the end of each reporting period. 
 
(j) Share Based Payments
 
 
In case of Group equity-settled share-based 
payment transactions, where the Company grants 
stock options to the employees of its subsidiaries, 
the transactions are accounted by increasing 
the cost of investment in subsidiary with a 
corresponding credit in the equity. 
 
(k) Foreign Currencies Transactions and 
Translation
 
 
Exchange gains or losses on foreign currency 
borrowings taken prior to April 1, 2016 which 
are related to the acquisition or construction of 
qualifying assets are adjusted in the carrying cost 
of such assets.
 
(l) Revenue Recognition
 
 
Revenue from contracts with customers is 
recognised when control of the goods or services 
are transferred to the customer at an amount that 
reflects the consideration entitled in exchange for 
those goods or services. The Group is generally 
the principal as it typically controls the goods or 
services before transferring them to the customer.
 
 
Revenue is measured at the amount of consideration 
which the Group expects to be entitled to in 
exchange for transferring distinct goods or 
services to a customer as specified in the contract, 
excluding amounts collected on behalf of third 
parties (for example taxes and duties collected 
on behalf of the government). Consideration is 
generally due upon satisfaction of performance 
obligations and a receivable is recognised when it 
becomes unconditional. 
 
 
Generally, the credit period varies between 0-60 
days from the shipment or delivery of goods or 
completion of services as the case may be. The 
Group provides volume rebates to certain customers 
once the quantity of products purchased during 
the period exceeds a threshold specified and also 
accrues discounts to certain customers based on 
customary business practices which is derived 
on the basis of crude price volatility and various 
market demand – supply situations. Consideration 
are determined based on its most likely amount. 
Generally, sales of petroleum products contain 
provisional pricing features where revenue is initially 
recognised based on provisional price. Difference 
between final settlement price and provisional price 
is recognised subsequently.
 
(m) Financial Instruments
 
 
Financial Assets
 
 
 
Purchase and sale of Financial Assets are 
recognised using trade date accounting. 
Trade receivables that do not contain 
a significant financing component are 
measured at transaction price.
 
 
 
The Company has elected to account for its 
investments in associates and joint venture at 
cost less impairment loss (if any). 
 
 
 
All other equity investments are measured 
at fair value, with value changes recognised 
in Statement of Profit and Loss, except 
for those equity investments for which 
the Group has elected to present the 
value changes in ‘Other Comprehensive 
Income’. However, dividend on such equity 
investments are recognised in Statement 
of Profit and Loss when the Company’s 
right to receive payment is established. The 
investments in preference shares with the 
right to surplus assets which are in nature 
of equity in accordance with Ind AS 32 are 
treated as separate category of investment 
and measured at Fair Value Through Other 
Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI). Other 
Financial Assets are generally measured at 
Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) 
except where the Group, based on the 
business model objectives, measures these 
at Amortized Cost or Fair Value Through 
Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI).
 
 
 
The Group uses ‘Expected Credit Loss’ (ECL) 
model, for evaluating impairment of Financial 
Assets other than those measured at Fair 
Value Through Profit Or Loss (FVTPL).
 
 
 
Expected Credit Losses are measured 
through a loss allowance at an amount 
equal to: 
 
−The 12-months expected credit losses 
(expected credit losses that result from 
those default events on the financial 
instrument that are possible within 12 
months after the reporting date); or 
 
−Full lifetime expected credit losses 
(expected credit losses that result from 
all possible default events over the life of 
the financial instrument).
 
 
 
For Trade Receivables, the Group applies 
‘simplified approach’ which requires 
expected lifetime losses to be recognised 
from initial recognition of the receivables. 
 
 
 
The Group uses historical default rates to 
determine impairment loss on the portfolio 
of trade receivables. At every reporting date 
these historical default rates are reviewed 
and changes in the forward-looking estimates 
are analysed.
 
 
 
For other assets, the Group uses 12 month 
ECL to provide for impairment loss where 
there is no significant increase in credit risk. 
If there is significant increase in credit risk 
full lifetime ECL is used. 
 
 
ii. 
Financial Liabilities 
 
 
 
For trade and other payables maturing 
within one year from the balance sheet 
date, the carrying amounts are determined 
to approximate fair value due to the short 
maturity of these instruments.
 
 
iii. 
Derivative Financial Instruments and 
Hedge Accounting 
 
 
 
The Group uses various derivative financial 
instruments such as interest rate swaps, 
currency swaps, forwards & options and 
commodity contracts to mitigate the risk 
of changes in interest rates, exchange rates 
and commodity prices. At the inception of 
a hedge relationship, the Group formally 
designates and documents the hedge 
relationship to which the Group wishes 
to apply hedge accounting and the risk 
management objective and strategy for 
undertaking the hedge. 
 
 
 
Any gains or losses arising from changes in 
the fair value of derivatives are taken directly 
to Statement of Profit and Loss, except for 
the effective portion of cash flow hedge 
which is recognised in Other Comprehensive 
Income and later to Statement of Profit and 
Loss when the hedged item affects profit 
or loss or is treated as basis adjustment if a 
hedged forecast transaction subsequently 
results in the recognition of a Non-Financial 
Assets or Non-Financial liabilities. 

Integrated Annual Report 2023-24
Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024

 
 
 
Hedges that meet the criteria for hedge 
accounting are accounted for as follows: 
 
 
 
Cash Flow Hedge 
 
 
 
 
The Group designates derivative 
contracts or non-derivative Financial 
Assets / Liabilities as hedging 
instruments to mitigate the risk of 
movement in interest rates and foreign 
exchange rates for foreign exchange 
exposure on highly probable future cash 
flows attributable to a recognised asset 
or liability or forecast cash transactions. 
 
 
 
Fair Value Hedge 
 
 
 
 
The Group designates derivative 
contracts or non-derivative Financial 
Assets / Liabilities as hedging 
instruments to mitigate the risk of 
change in fair value of hedged item due 
to movement in interest rates, foreign 
exchange rates and commodity prices.
 
 
iv. 
Offsetting 
 
 
 
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities are 
offset and the net amount is presented in 
the balance sheet when, and only when, the 
Group has a legally enforceable right to set 
off the amount and it intends, either to settle 
them on a net basis or to realise the asset 
and settle the liability simultaneously. 
 
(n) Accounting for Oil and Gas Activity
 
 
Oil and Gas Joint Arrangement are in the nature of 
joint operations. Accordingly, assets and liabilities 
as well as income and expenditure are accounted 
on the basis of available information on a line‑byline basis with similar items in the Financial 
Statements, according to the participating 
interest of the Group.
 
 
The Group follows the Guidance Note on 
Accounting for Oil and Gas producing activities 
– Ind AS issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India for the purpose of 
accounting. Seismic costs, geological and 
geophysical studies, petroleum exploration 
license fees and general and administration costs 
directly attributable to exploration and evaluation 
activities are expensed off. The costs incurred on 
acquisition of interest in oil and gas blocks and on 
exploration and evaluation other than those which 
are expensed off are accounted for as Intangible 
Assets Under Development. All development 
costs incurred in respect of proved reserves are 
also capitalised under Intangible Assets Under 
Development. Once a well is ready to commence 
commercial production, the costs accumulated 
in Intangible Assets Under Development are 
classified as Intangible Assets corresponding 
to proved developed oil and gas reserves. The 
exploration and evaluation expenditure which 
does not result in discovery of proved oil and gas 
reserves and all cost pertaining to production are 
charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss. 
 
 
The Group uses technical estimation of reserves 
as per the Petroleum Resources Management 
System guidelines 2011 and standard geological 
and reservoir engineering methods. The reserve 
review and evaluation is carried out annually. 
C. Critical Accounting Judgements and 
Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty
 
The preparation of the Group’s financial statements 
require management to make judgement, estimates 
and assumptions that affect the reported amount 
of revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities and the 
accompanying disclosures. Uncertainty about these 
assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes 
that require a material adjustment to the carrying 
amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.
 
(A) Estimation of Oil and Gas Reserves
 
 
The determination of the Group’s estimated 
oil and natural gas reserves require significant 
judgements and estimates to be applied and these 
are regularly reviewed and updated. Factors such 
as the availability of geological and engineering 
data, reservoir performance data, acquisition 
and divestment activity, drilling of new wells, and 
commodity prices all impact on the determination 
of the Group’s estimates of its oil and natural gas 
reserves. The Group bases it’s proved reserves 
estimates on the requirement of reasonable 
certainty with rigorous technical and commercial 
assessments based on conventional industry 
practice and regulatory requirements.
 
 
Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are 
used to calculate depletion charges for the 
Group’s oil and gas properties. The impact of 
changes in estimated proved reserves is dealt 
with prospectively by amortising the remaining 
carrying value of the asset over the expected 
future production. Oil and natural gas reserves 
also have a direct impact on the assessment of the 
recoverability of asset carrying values reported in 
the financial statements.
 
 
Details on proved reserves and production both 
on product and geographical basis are provided in 
Note 34.
 
(B) Property Plant and Equipment / Other 
Intangible Assets
 
 
Estimates are involved in determining the cost 
attributable to bringing the assets to the location 
and condition necessary for it to be capable 
of operating in the manner intended by the 
management. Property, Plant and Equipment / 
Other Intangible Assets are depreciated / 
amortised over their estimated useful life, 
after taking into account estimated residual 
value. Spectrum Cost is amortised over its 
balance validity period, based on the expected 
pattern of consumption of the expected future 
economic benefits.
 
 
Management reviews the estimated useful life 
and residual values of the assets annually in 
order to determine the amount of depreciation / 
amortisation to be recorded during any reporting 
period. The useful life and residual values are 
based on the Group’s historical experience with 
similar assets and take into account anticipated 
technological and future risks. The depreciation / 
amortisation for future periods is revised if there 
are significant changes from previous estimates.
 
(C) Provisions
 
 
The timing of recognition and quantification of 
the liability (including litigations) requires the 
application of judgement to existing facts and 
circumstances, which can be subject to change. 
The carrying amounts of provisions and liabilities 
are reviewed regularly and revised to take account 
of changing facts and circumstances.
 
(D) Impairment of Goodwill, Intangible 
Assets under Development and Intangible 
Assets with Indefinite Useful Life
 
 
Management reviews the carrying value of 
goodwill, intangible assets under development 
and intangible assets with indefinite useful 
life annually, to determine whether there has 
been any impairment by allocating the value of 
goodwill, intangible assets under development 
and intangible assets with indefinite useful life 
to a Cash Generating Unit (CGU). The Group has 
identified CGUs’ for this purpose, considering 
the nature of the businesses to which each of the 
CGU relates.
 
 
Value in use i.e. the enterprise value of each CGU 
is aggregate of cash flow projections, for five 
years as approved by Senior Management and 
beyond five years extrapolated using a long-term 
growth rate which ranges from 2% to 5%. Cash 
flow projections are discounted by a pre-tax 
discount rate, being the Weighted Average Cost of 
Capital (WACC), which ranges from 8% to 12%.
 
 
The Management believes that any reasonably 
possible change in the above key assumptions on 
which recoverable amount is based would not 
cause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed 
the aggregate recoverable amount of the CGU.
 
 
Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite 
lives have been allocated to the respective CGUs. 
During the year ended March 31, 2024, the 
Group has determined that there is no impairment 
towards these assets.
 
(E) Impairment of Financial and 
Non‑Financial Assets
 
 
The impairment provisions for Financial Assets 
are based on assumptions about risk of default 
and expected cash loss rates. The Group uses 
judgement in making these assumptions and 
selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation, 
based on Group’s past history, existing market 
conditions as well as forward-looking estimates at 
the end of each reporting period.
 
 
In case of non-financial assets, the Group 
estimates asset’s recoverable amount, which 
is higher of an asset’s or Cash Generating Units 
(CGU’s) fair value less costs of disposal and its 
value in use.
 
 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value 
using pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset. In determining 
fair value less costs of disposal, recent market 
transactions are taken into account, if no such 
transactions can be identified, an appropriate 
valuation model is used. 
 
(F) Fair Value Measurement
 
 
For estimates relating to fair value of financial 
instruments refer Note 37 of Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
 
(G) Leases
 
 
The Group evaluates if an arrangement qualifies 
to be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 
116. Identification of a lease requires significant 
judgement. The Group uses judgement in 
assessing whether a contract (or part of contract) 
include a lease, the lease term (including 
anticipated renewals), the applicable discount 
rate, variable lease payments whether are 
in-substance fixed. The judgement involves 
assessment of whether the asset included in the 
contract is a fully or partly identified asset based 
on the facts and circumstances, whether the 
contract include a lease and non-lease component 
and if so, separation thereof for the purpose of 
recognition and measurement, determination of 
lease term basis, inter alia the non-cancellable 
period of lease and whether the lessee intends 
to opt for continuing with the use of the asset 
upon the expiry thereof, and whether the lease 
payments are fixed are variable or a combination 
of both.

The estimates of Rate of Escalation in salary considered in actuarial valuation, take into account inflation, seniority, promotion 
and other relevant factors including supply and demand in the employment market. The above information is certified by 
the actuaries.
 
 
The Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets is determined considering several applicable factors, mainly the composition of 
Plan Assets held, assessed risks, historical results of return on Plan Assets and the Group’s policy for Plan Assets Management.
 
VIII) The expected contributions for Defined Benefit Plan for the next financial year will be in line with financial year 
2023‑24.
 
IX) 
These plan’s typically expose the Group to actuarial risks such as: Investment Risk, Interest Risk, Longevity Risk and 
Salary Risk.
Investment Risk
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is 
determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds.
Interest Risk
A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability; however, this will be partially offset by 
an increase in the return on the plan's debt investments.
Longevity Risk
The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the 
mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of 
the plan participants will increase the plan's liability.
Salary Risk
The present value of the defined plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan 
participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability.

The reserve estimates for producing fields are revised based on the performance of producing fields and with respect to 
discovered fields, the revision are based on the revised geological and reservoir simulation studies.
 
34.3 The Government of India (GOI), disallowed certain costs which the Production Sharing Contract (PSC), relating to Block KGDWN-98/3 (KG-D6) entitles the Company to recover. The Company maintains that the Contractor is entitled to recover all of its 
costs under the terms of the PSC and there are no provisions that entitle the GOI to disallow the recovery of any Contract Cost. 
The Company referred the issue to arbitration with GOI for resolution of disputes. The demand from the GOI of $ 165 million 
(for C 1,373 crore) being the Company’s share (total demand $ 247 million – C 2,060 crore) towards additional Profit Petroleum 
has been considered as contingent liability in the financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024.
 
 
In supersession of the Ministry’s Gazette notification no. 22011/3/2012-ONG.D.V. dated 10th January, 2014, the GOI 
notified the New Domestic Natural Gas Pricing Guidelines, 2014 on 26th October, 2014. The GOI had directed the Company to 
instruct customers to deposit differential revenue on gas sales from D1D3 field on account of the prices determined under the 
guidelines converted to NCV basis and the prevailing price prior to 1st November, 2014 ($ 4.205 per MMBTU) to be credited 
to the gas pool account maintained by GAIL (India) Limited. The amount so deposited by customer to Gas Pool Account is C 295 
crore (net) as at 31st March, 2024. Revenue has been recognized at the GOI notified prices on GCV basis, in respect of gas 
quantities sold from D1D3 field from 1st November, 2014. This amount in the Gas Pool Account has also been challenged under 
cost recovery arbitration and is pending adjudication. 
 
34.4 (a) 
GOI sent a notice to the KG-D6 Contractor on 4th November, 2016 asking the Contractor to deposit approximately 
US $1.55 billion on account of alleged gas migration from ONGC’s blocks. RIL, as Operator, for and on behalf of all 
constituents of the Contractor, initiated arbitration proceedings against the GOI contesting its unfair claim. The Arbitral 

Integrated Annual Report 2023-24
Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024

Tribunal vide its Final Award dated 24th July, 2018 upheld Contractor’s claims. GOI filed an Appeal on 15th November, 
2018 before the Single Judge Bench of Hon’ble Delhi High Court (DHC), against the Final Award. Vide Judgment dated 
9th May, 2023 the Hon’ble Single Judge of DHC upheld the Arbitration Award and dismissed GOI’s appeal challenging 
the Award. An appeal was filed by GOI before the Division Bench of DHC to set aside single judge’s judgment which is 
presently sub-judice.
 
 
(b) 
Arbitration was initiated by BG Exploration and Production India Limited and the Company (together the Claimants) 
against GOI under the PSCs for Panna – Mukta and Tapti blocks due to difference in interpretation of certain 
PSC provisions between Claimants and GOI. The Arbitration Tribunal has issued a number of final partial awards in this 
matter, some of which have (in part) not been in Claimant’s favour. The arbitration is ongoing and a final award is yet to be 
issued. The arbitration has also led to satellite litigation in India (presently ongoing) and in the UK, which has resulted in 
court judgments that have not always been entirely in RIL’s favour
 
 
(c) 
NTPC filed suit in 2006 for specific performance of contract for supply of natural gas of 132 trillion BTU annually for a 
period of 17 years. This suit is still pending adjudication in the Bombay High Court and the Company’s fact witnesses in 
the suit are to be cross examined by NTPC.
 
 
Considering the complexity of above issues, the Company is of the view that any attempt for quantification of possible 
exposure to the Company will have an effect of prejudicing Company’s legal position in the ongoing arbitration/ litigations. 
Moreover, the Company considers above demand/disputes as remote.

(III) On December 16, 2010, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) issued a show cause notice (“SCN”) inter alia to the 
Company (RIL) in connection with the trades by RIL in the stock exchanges in 2007 in the shares of Reliance Petroleum Limited, 
then a subsidiary of RIL. By an order dated March 24, 2017, the Whole Time Member (“WTM”) passed directions: (i) prohibiting 
inter alia RIL from dealing in equity derivatives in the ‘Futures & Options’ segment of stock exchanges, directly or indirectly, for 
a period of one year from the date of the order; and (ii) to disgorge from RIL an amount of C 447 crore along with interest at the 
rate of 12% per annum from November 29, 2007, till the date of payment. On an appeal by RIL, Securities Appellate Tribunal 
(“SAT”) by a majority order (2:1), dismissed the appeal on November 5, 2020, and directed RIL to pay the disgorged amount 
within sixty days from the date of the order. The appeal of RIL and others had been admitted by the Hon’ble Supreme Court 
of India. By its order dated December 17, 2020, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India directed RIL to deposit C 250 crore in the 
Investors’ Protection Fund, subject to the final result of the appeal and stayed the recovery of the balance, inclusive of interest, 
pending the appeal. RIL has complied with the order dated December 17, 2020, of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India.
 
 
In the above matter, the adjudicating officer of SEBI (“AO”) while adjudicating the show cause notice dated November 21, 
2017 issued, inter alia, to RIL passed an order on January 1, 2021 imposing a penalty of C 25 crore on RIL which has been paid 
under protest. In the appeal filed by RIL, the Hon’ble Securities Appellate Tribunal vide order dated December 4, 2023, did 
not interfere with the order passed by the AO since the matter was already covered by its earlier decision dated November 5, 
2020, which is in appeal by RIL before the Hon’ble Supreme Court. RIL has filed an appeal in the Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
India against Order dated December 4, 2023 of SAT. 
 
(IV) Hathway Cable and Datacom Limited has received Show Cause cum Demand notices (“SCNs”) from the Department of 
Telecommunications (“DOT”), Government of India towards license fees aggregating to C 3,202 crore which includes penalty 
and interest thereon (March 31, 2023: C 3,748 crore including penalty and interest). The Group has made representations to 
DOT contesting the basis of such demands. Based on opinion of legal expert, the Group is confident that it has good grounds on 
merit to defend itself in the above matter. Accordingly, the Group is of the view that no provision is necessary in respect of the 
aforesaid matter. 
36. Capital Management
 
The Group adheres to a disciplined Capital Management framework in order to maintain a strong balance sheet. The main objectives 
are as follows:
 
Maintain investment grade ratings for all issuing entities, domestically and internationally by ensuring that the financial 
strength of their Balance Sheets are preserved.
 
Manage foreign exchange, interest rates and commodity price risk, and minimise the impact of market
volatility on earnings.
 
Diversify sources of financing and spread the maturity across tenure buckets in order to manage liquidity risk.
 
Leverage optimally in order to maximise shareholder returns.

The financial instruments are categorised into three levels based on the inputs used to arrive at fair value measurements 
as described below:
 
 
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
 
 
Level 2: Inputs other than the quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
or indirectly; and
 
 
Level 3: Inputs based on unobservable market data.
 
 
Valuation Methodology
 
 
All financial instruments are initially recognised and subsequently re-measured at fair value as described below:
 
 
The fair value of investment in quoted Equity Shares, Bonds, Government Securities, Treasury Bills, Certificate of 
Deposits and Mutual Funds is measured at quoted price or NAV.
 
 
The fair value of Interest Rate Swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on 
observable yield curves.
 
 
The fair value of Forward Foreign Exchange contracts and Currency Swaps is determined using observable forward 
exchange rates and yield curves at the balance sheet date.
 
 
The fair value of over-the-counter Foreign Currency Option contracts is determined using the Black Scholes 
valuation model.
 
 
Commodity derivative contracts are valued using available information in markets and quotations from exchange, brokers 
and price index developers.
 
 
The fair value for Level 3 instruments is valued using inputs based on information about market participants assumptions 
and other data that are available.
 
 
The fair value of the remaining financial instruments is determined using discounted cash flow analysis.
 
 
All foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rate at reporting date.

Financial Risk Management
 
 
The Group’s activities expose it to variety of financial risks: market risk, credit risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. Within 
the boundaries of approved Risk Management Policy framework, the Group uses derivative instruments to manage the 
volatility of financial markets and minimise the adverse impact on its financial performance.
 
 
Market Risk
 
 
 
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes 
in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as 
equity price risk and commodity risk.
 
 
 
Foreign Currency Risk
 
 
 
 
Foreign Currency Risk is the risk that the Fair Value or Future Cash Flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of 
changes in foreign currency rates. Exposures can arise on account of the various assets and liabilities which are 
denominated in currencies other than Indian Rupee.
 
 
 
 
The following table shows foreign currency exposures in US Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen on financial instruments 
at the end of the reporting period. The exposure to all other foreign currencies are not material.

The Group is also exposed to interest rate risk, changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair 
values of its financial instruments, principally debt. The Group issues debt in a variety of currencies based on market 
opportunities and it uses derivatives to hedge interest rate exposures.

ii) 
Commodity Price Risk
 
 
 
Commodity price risk arises due to fluctuation in prices of crude oil, other feed stock and products and bullion. The Group 
has a risk management framework aimed at prudently managing the risk arising from the volatility in commodity prices 
and freight costs.
 
 
 
The Group’s commodity price risk is managed centrally through well-established trading operations and control 
processes. In accordance with the risk management policy, the Group enters into various transactions using derivatives 
and uses over-the-counter as well as Exchange Traded Futures, Options and Swap contracts to hedge its commodity and 
freight exposure.
 
 
iii) 
Credit Risk
 
 
 
Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform or pay the amounts due 
causing financial loss to the Group. Credit risk arises from Group’s activities in investments, dealing in derivatives and 
receivables from customers and other financial instruments. The Group ensures that sales of products are made to 
customers with appropriate creditworthiness. Credit information is regularly shared between businesses and finance 
function, with a framework in place to quickly identify, respond and recognise cases of credit deterioration.
 
 
 
The Group has a prudent and conservative process for managing its credit risk arising in the course of its business 
activities. Credit risk across the Group, is actively managed through Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees, Parent Group 
Guarantees, advance payments, security deposits and factoring and forfaiting without recourse to Group. The Group 
restricts its fixed income investments in liquid securities carrying high credit rating.
 
 
iv) 
Liquidity Risk
 
 
 
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s inability to meet its cash flow commitments on the due date. The Group maintains 
sufficient stock of cash, marketable securities and committed credit facilities. The Group accesses global and local 
financial markets to meet its liquidity requirements. It uses a range of products and a mix of currencies to ensure efficient 
funding from across well-diversified markets and investor pools. Treasury monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s cash 
flow position and ensures that the Group is able to meet its financial obligation at all times including contingencies.
 
 
 
The Group’s liquidity is managed centrally with operating units forecasting their cash and liquidity requirements. Treasury 
pools the cash surpluses from across the different operating units and then arranges to either fund the net deficit or 
invest the net surplus in a range of short-dated, secure and liquid instruments including short-term bank deposits, 
money market funds, reverse repos and similar instruments. The portfolio of these investments is diversified to avoid 
concentration risk in any one instrument or counterparty.

Hedge Accounting
 
 
The Group’s business objective includes safe-guarding its earnings against adverse price movements of crude oil and other 
feedstock, refined products, precious metals, freight costs as well as foreign exchange and interest rates. The Group has 
adopted a structured risk management policy to hedge all these risks within an acceptable risk limit and an approved hedge 
accounting framework which allows for Fair Value and Cash Flow hedges. Hedging instruments include exchange traded 
futures and options, over-the-counter swaps, forwards and options as well as non-derivative instruments to achieve this 
objective. 
 
 
There is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments. The Group has established a hedge 
ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships. To test the hedge effectiveness, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method 
and Dollar offset method.
 
 
The hedge ineffectiveness can arise from:
 
 
- Differences in the timing of the cash flows. 
 
 
- Different indexes (and accordingly different curves). 
 
 
- The counterparties’ credit risk differently impacting the fair value movements.
 
 
The table below shows the position of hedging instruments and hedged items as on the balance sheet date:
