Leading 
Leadership is as much about responsibility 
as it is about scale and size. It goes much 
beyond offering world-class banking 
products and services and is also about 
creating value for all our stakeholders. This 
means we are embedding ESG aspects 
into our business strategy. As a domestic 
systemically important bank, we feel this 
responsibility even more. 
We have pledged to become carbon neutral by 
FY32. Lending decisions are being increasingly 
put through the Environmental, Social and 
Governance (ESG) lens and greater emphasis is 
being laid on green financing solutions.
At the same time, we are undertaking focused 
interventions that are making meaningful 
contributions to global sustainable development 
goals around reducing poverty, achieving zero 
hunger, providing clean water and sanitation, 
quality education, and building sustainable 
communities. 
Leveraging our unmatched physical network and 
robust digital capabilities, we are expanding our 
Responsibly
stakeholder universe where the real and virtual 
worlds converge seamlessly, and more people 
are brought into the economic mainstream. The 
unprecedented challenges of the past two years 
notwithstanding, we have made steady progress 
on our sustainability targets. 
We believe in leading by example. Responsibility, 
thus, begins with us. We are deploying technology 
as a force multiplier and anchoring all our actions 
to the highest possible standards of Corporate 
Governance. Together with our stakeholders, we 
are building the bank of the future that can stand 
the test of time.

Reimagining the future with 
technology and a service first culture
Message from the MD & CEO
Dear Stakeholders,
Let me start by wishing all of you a happy and healthy future. 
The pandemic has clearly reinforced the message that 
Health is Wealth.
If FY21 saw the darkest period of the pandemic, then 
the last financial year was the year of hope. Though the 
pandemic did not disappear, the nationwide roll out of the 
vaccine programme meant that lives were more secure, and 
coupled with precautions, people could get back to some 
degree of normalcy.
With the period of uncertainty mostly behind us, I believe 
a more positive macroeconomic outlook dominates the 
executive agenda, across industries. While there are 
headwinds in the form of rising inflation and the Ukraine 
crisis, among several others, India is expected to grow 7.3% 
and is likely to be the fastest-growing major economy in the 
world in FY23 with the strength to absorb external shocks.
Our Performance
Our Balance Sheet has been resilient during the pandemic 
and has grown further. Our asset quality continues to remain 
healthy and amongst the best in the industry. Our Balance 
Sheet increased by 18.4% to `20,68,535 Cr and Net Profit 
increased by 18.8% to `36,961.3 Cr. GNPA decreased 
to 1.17% from 1.32%. ROA (average) was at a healthy 
2.03% and ROE at a healthy 16.9%. Our commitment to 
shareholders remained high with a proposed dividend payout of `15.50 (Fifteen Rupees Fifty Paise only) per equity 
share of `1 (Rupee 1 only), which translates to a dividend 
pay-out ratio of 23.28% for the financial year ended 
March 31, 2022.
I would like to say a heartfelt ‘Thank You’ to all my 
colleagues for this performance. Each one of the one lakh 
forty-one thousand plus members of the HDFC Bank family 
gave their best in truly challenging times, so we could serve 
you as we have for decades. Words cannot adequately 
convey my gratitude to them.
In my letter to you all last year, I had highlighted my key 
focus areas. Improving technology resilience, a clear focus 
on three Cs — Culture, Conscience and Customer and 
building for the future.
Let me now focus on these.
Technology Resilience
Last year I had said that technology continues to remain 
both a strength as well as an area of improvement. Strength, 
as without this, we could not have grown to be a bank of this 
scale and increased our market share consistently. However, 
our customers faced some technology-related issues in 
accessing the Bank’s products and services during the 
previous year, which had led to some regulatory action, 
last fiscal.
Sashidhar Jagdishan
Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, 
HDFC Bank Limited

I am happy to inform you that thanks to the progress we 
have made on our technology investments, processes and 
governance, the regulatory actions have been fully lifted. We 
converted the challenge into an opportunity and have made 
substantial strides in the way we evaluate, manage and 
operationalise our technology. To enable the infusion of a 
modern technology platform one needs to lay a very strong 
foundation and we have done that over the last one year, 
through a series of technology-led initiatives that include 
i) changes at the foundational level ii) creating new digital 
solutions iii) modernising the core.
At the foundational level, we have
A. Shifted our primary data centres to state-of-theart brand-new facilities in Mumbai and Bengaluru, 
to support higher uptimes and create a robust IT 
backbone for our operations.
B. A clearly defined capacity monitoring programme to 
proactively manage capacity upgrades across all key 
applications.
C. A technology obsolescence programme management 
office to plan and replace obsolescent components.
D. Started putting in place next-gen disaster recovery (DR) 
set up for key applications.
E. Implemented landing zone architecture to leverage the 
cloud resilience, with elastic scalability, and at the same 
time have control over ecosystem on cloud. 
Implemented a new Application Programming Interface 
(API) gateway and a new API development framework.
G. Kick-started modernisation of our data warehouse 
with a cloud-enabled data lake platform, that would 
enable us to leverage AI/ML models and new age deep 
learning capabilities on the rich data set that we have.
ii) Creating new age solutions through Digital 
Factory
A. Rebuilding of our acquisition journeys in partnership 
with a global technology leader in user experience. We 
have already built 10 new journeys and will be rapidly 
rolling out new journeys every 3 weeks. This includes 
journeys across account opening, loans and cards, 
covering both individual/MSME customers and both 
existing and new-to-bank customers.
B. We have launched ‘Xpress Car Loans’ – an end-to-end 
digital car loan journey for existing customers as well as 
non-customers, that allows them to avail disbursement 
in 30 mins, with credit decisions based on speedy 
data analysis. This is a first in the Indian industry and 
the Bank has integrated its lending application with 
automobile dealers across the country.
C. In the next few quarters, we will launch more of our 
products and services under Digital 2.0 including 
a new payments platform for our customers, 
payments platform for our merchants and a 
wealth platform — all in partnerships with new age 
tech companies.
iii) Modernising the core
The digital partnership strategy will help us to modernise 
existing experiences quickly without changing the legacy 
core. It is imperative that the Bank has a long-term vision on 
revamping its core banking and mobile channel experiences. 
Toward this we have created our ‘Enterprise Factory’ 
wherein the Bank’s tech and digital teams work in a new 
age start-up like environment and co-create deep tech IP 
capabilities. This is a departure from the past where our 
technology IP was largely partner-owned and enabled. We 
believe that as banks become more digital, they also need

HDFC Bank Limited Integrated Annual Report 2021-22

Message from the MD & CEO
to have in-house foundational technology capabilities to 
compete with neo-techs. Toward this, the Bank has started 
two very strategic initiatives:
A. 'Hollow the Core' Strategy — The Bank, in partnership 
with a new age start-up (with deep experience in 
core banking technology), is co-creating new core 
banking modules. This project will enable the moving 
out of payments module from existing core banking 
platform and help in creating a fully resilient activeactive payments architecture that will ensure minimal 
payments downtime, even if core banking is not 
available. This 15-month project will be followed by 
hollowing the customer master modules from its 
existing core systems and will ensure a single system of 
record for customers across various products.
B. Rewrite Mobile and NetBanking Applications — The 
Bank has set up a new centre in Bengaluru and the 
team here is re-writing the Mobile and NetBanking 
platforms. The entire project will be completed in a 
2-year time frame and will allow the Bank to own a 
modern cloud enabled Mobile/NetBanking platform. 
Enabling a new age experience for customers, we will 
roll out new features every 3 to 4 weeks, in line with 
digital fintech companies.
To summarise, our entire technology and digital strategy 
adopts a 360-degree approach that ensures resilience and 
modernisation of existing legacy systems and enables new 
age consumer experiences by partnering with modern neotechs. We have made rapid strides in creating the foundation 
and enabling new digital assets over the last one year. 
Needless to say, the pace will only pick up from here. Firmly 
committed to this transformation, the Bank will continue to 
invest in modern technology and talent.
Customer Centricity
Customer focus has been a core value for years and 
maintaining the highest possible standards in customer 
service has been the key to our success.
We are institutionalising a Service First culture at the Bank. 
Service First for us means respecting every customer and 
addressing their enquiries or complaints on time/every 
time, and working on the issues raised for a permanent fix. 
Service First for us is a commitment right from me and my 
colleagues to put a smile on our customers’ faces.
We have a two-pronged approach to achieve this. First, a 
culture of evangelisation right from the top and sensitising 
all our colleagues to be at the forefront of solving customer 
issues. Second, a strong measurement metric to be in place 
to continuously know that we are progressing in the right 
direction.
We have invested in tools and technology to ensure that 
some of the issues that customers face do not arise at all. 
For example, our MobileBanking app has been upgraded 
with wrapper technology that prevents fraudsters from 
reading OTPs, thereby preventing frauds and related 
complaints.
A strong bottom-up Net Promoter System (NPS) programme 
(‘Infinite Smiles’) covers customer interactions across all 
products/services and delivery channels. We actively poll 
our customers after their interactions with the Bank (>63 
Million customers polled during the financial year), listen 
to their feedback, and engage with them if we have not 
been up to the mark. I am happy to state that we lead the 
overall NPS ranking among 20+ competitors in the banking 
category, based on a competitive benchmarking study 
of NPS, which was done by an industry-leading 
consultancy firm.
Our performance on complaints resolution has also 
improved markedly during the year with significantly reduced 
customer complaints in the Credit Cards, Debit Cards, 
Operations and Collections front (complaints reduced by 
21%). We are not complacent about the progress and are 
being conscious and mindful of much more that needs 
to improve. We are working on several strategic initiatives 
(like the wrapper technology I mentioned earlier) to tackle 
complaints pertaining to ‘Disputed Transactions’ (where the 
customer succumbs to phishing attacks by fraudsters).
As part of our technology transformation agenda, we are 
also investing in an omni-channel customer experience 
platform. This will enable our customers to reach out to us 
through their preferred channel for service i.e., social, email, 
texts, voice, etc. It would also provide us a single source of 
customer truth across channels and would enable our frontline staff to solve customer queries and act on customer 
instructions in a straight through manner. This capability 
will improve our customer responsiveness and NPS. We 
are already live with our social media and email interactions 
on this platform and will add other channels of customer 
interactions during the course of this year.
Customer delight is a non-negotiable goal towards which we 
will continue to work.

Culture
For me, creating a good culture is as much a priority as 
driving growth. I am committed, along with my senior 
management colleagues, to walk the talk on culture.
An organisation is made of people, and it is the people that 
deliver the organisation to all the stakeholders. We have a 
talent pool of 1,41,000+ colleagues who are the Bank to our 
customers. We are ensuring that the supervisory pool of 
12,000 odd colleagues including the senior management, is 
responsible for nurturing the vastly talented front line, hand 
hold them in their personal and professional growth and 
create a great working environment.
You could well accuse us of being on an overdrive on our 
culture agenda. We continue to work towards creating an 
organisation where diversity and inclusion becomes a part 
of the DNA, where differences are valued and respected, 
where conversations are friendly and warm and where 
the emotional needs of our colleagues and customers are 
fulfilled.
To enhance our employee capabilities, we are fostering 
a culture of Nurture, Care and Collaborate (NCC) in the 
organisation. Customers experience the organisation 
through the employees and employees experience the 
organisation through their managers.
At HDFC Bank, we continuously measure our employee 
performance engagement scores. While our engagement 
scores are healthy at 83%, we still believe we have a long 
road to travel. Through our NCC intervention, 12,000+ 
people managers are certified on the elements of our 
culture pillars and the role they play as culture custodians. 
Our people managers are also continuously provided 
with various trainings and tools to improve themselves 
professionally. We will keep listening to our colleagues’ 
feedback and keep evolving our people management 
practices – it’s a continuing investment that we will 
keep making.
Building for the Future
Last year I had spoken about Project Future Ready, to 
catalyse, create and capture the next wave of growth. We 
had clearly spelt out the following as growth engines — 
Retail Assets, Commercial (MSME) and Rural Banking, 
Corporate Banking, Government and Institutional Banking, 
Wealth Management, and Payments. to be driven by our 
delivery channels of Branch Banking, Tele-Sales/Service/
Relationship and Digital Marketing. These growth engines 
can be broadly classified as Business Verticals and Delivery 
Channels. They will be powered by our robust technology 
and digital platforms and will account for the bulk of our 
future investments.
We have seen progress across our growth engines. 
Our focus on the MSME sector is paying off, with our 
Commercial and Rural Banking Group emerging as a strong 
growth driver (up 30.4%). We leveraged the opportunity 
available in the Corporate Banking sector (up 17.4%) without 
any compromise on our ROA. We are expanding our wealth 
management services to more cities and towns (now 700+ 
towns). Our Retail Loans continue to grow in the same 
pristine way (up 15.2%). Our Payments business is starting 
to recover well, post the lifting of the embargo and with the 
slew of new launches completed.
Branch Banking is the fulcrum of our customer relationships. 
We believe both physical proximity to and emotional connect 
with our customers are equally important. Our addition of 
734 branches even during the tough pandemic year has 
served us well and we are closely tracking the success 
metrics of per branch profitability and productivity. Our 
relationship management has been further strengthened by 
the tele sales-service-relationship vertical with enhanced 
investments in both people and technology capabilities (29% 
increase in customers managed with 40% plus increase in 
business). Digital Marketing continues to make strides as 
a new delivery channel, creating and harnessing the traffic 
(up 15%) on our digital properties and contributing to direct 
business generation.
Our core enabling functions of Internal Audit, Credit 
and Underwriting, Risk Management and Compliance/
Governance are being strengthened even further to support 
our growth.

Message from the MD & CEO
Why the Merger?
Quite simply, this is an opportunity we cannot afford to 
miss. Home loans are an emotional product and bring with 
them a host of accelerated benefits for the Bank. Today 
the environment for buying a home has changed. RERA 
has ensured greater transparency in the process. Price 
corrections in the property market have seen inventories 
come down. Also, rising incomes mean that home loan EMIs 
have come down as a percentage of a person’s income. 
Thanks to the penetration of telecom, internet and television 
services, the desire to own better homes has increased 
across the country. All this means that housing is going to 
be a huge growth opportunity and one of the key drivers of 
India’s GDP over the next decade.
Further, only 2% of our customers source their home loans 
through us, while 5% do it from other institutions. The 
latter is equivalent to the size of our retail book. Home loan 
customers typically keep deposits that are 5 to 7 times that 
of other retail customers. And about 70% of HDFC Ltd.’s 
customers do not bank with us. All these give us an idea 
about the size of the opportunity. The long tenor nature of 
home loans provides resiliency to the balance sheet. The 
Bank is one of the largest consumer durable financiers in 
the country. We can easily bundle this with a home loan, as 
with every home loan, there is a propensity of a customer to 
take new consumer durables. It is this kind of bundling that 
will increase margins. With the advantage of a lower cost of 
funds and the phenomenal distribution muscle that we have 
built, it is imperative that we seize this opportunity.
Why now?
There have been other favourable factors too. In the last few 
years, the regulatory arbitrage between banks and NBFCs 
has come down substantially. Today reserve requirements 
have come down to about 22% from 26%. Both institutions 
are well capitalised and have surplus liquidity and a strong 
portfolio of investments in Government securities. The 
increase in priority sector lending that we need to do, due 
to the merger, is possible now with our own increased focus 
on MSMEs, the affordable housing loans that we can do and 
the well-developed PSL certificate market. All this means 
that on the day of the merger there may not be any need 
to raise further funds to meet reserve requirements. The 
addition of the home mortgages portfolio on our Balance 
Sheet makes it more diversified and robust.
The enhanced capital position of the Bank post the merger 
also means that we can take bigger exposures in leading 
corporates and power the country’s infrastructure build out.
The key focus area for the Bank to absorb this growth 
opportunity is to secure enhanced liabilities to fund future 
growth. The branch network has been a key deposit 
mobilisation engine during its 27 years of growth, leading 
in customer acquisition, customer retention and advertising 
the solidity of the Bank and hence garnering liabilities by 
becoming the primary banking partner for our customers. 
India continues to be under-penetrated and underserved 
from a banking perspective. The density of branches for 
the population of this country is way below that of OECD 
countries. This is where our branch banking strategy comes 
in. Today we have 6,000+ branches across India, and we 
plan to nearly double our network in the next three to five 
years by opening 1,500 to 2,000 branches every year. 
The branch will be digital from a customer on-boarding 
and transaction/servicing perspective. It will provide the 
emotional connect and relationship management necessary 
for offering financial solutions to our customers. These 
branches will be small in size and will be phygital relationship 
centres. This will enable us to go after the catchment more 
aggressively and build the required liability franchise that 
we are known for, and we are confident that we would 
execute well.
Merger - The Power of One
Now, let me come to the proposed merger with HDFC Ltd. 
We look forward to the phenomenal set of talent, deep 
product knowledge and expertise, the processes, and 
systems that HDFC Ltd will add to the Bank’s existing ones.
On April 4, 2022, the two institutions had announced a 
transformational merger that is subject to various regulatory 
approvals and will take effect in about 15 to 18 months. The 
questions that have been asked are — 
why? and why now?

Environment, Social and Governance Strategy
The last two years has reminded all of us that our destinies 
are interconnected. Our ESG strategy is based on this 
interconnectedness, especially in the Environment and 
Social spheres. Climate change can disrupt both lives and 
livelihoods. Also, none of us should forget that the world 
belongs to the coming generations as much as to us.
We have already committed to becoming carbon neutral 
by FY32. ESG is being made an integral part of our credit 
assessment process. While assessment of environment and 
social factors has been a part of credit diligence, particularly 
in project financing above a certain threshold, we have 
recently introduced a comprehensive ESG assessment 
framework in corporate lending and with a wider target 
coverage. The objective at this stage is to create more 
awareness among our corporate borrowers, assess their 
position and understand their initiatives on ESG. Over the 
next 2 to 3 years, we would be looking to make it one of the 
key criteria in credit decisioning.
Our commitment to social good remains unwavering. 
Through our CSR initiatives under Parivartan we have 
already potentially impacted 9.6 Crore+ lives. That is an 
addition of about 1 Crore lives since last year. We are driving 
inclusivity and diversity within our organisation, with a 
special focus on further enhancing gender diversity.
We believe that good corporate governance is a product of 
culture and conscience and for us, profitability and growth 
cannot come at the cost of these. Our focus on compliance 
and assurance functions is unwavering and every aspect of 
compliance is adhered to with all sincerity, completeness 
and within requisite timelines. We ensure that every 
commitment given to our regulators is done on time, in its 
full form and substance.
Customers are the very reason for our existence and are at 
the heart of everything we do. To reiterate what I said last 
year, all individuals must ask themselves — am I doing the 
right thing for the customer? Am I doing the right thing for 
the organisation? Does my conscience permit this? As a 
Bank we have always taken pride in our integrity. I had also 
said last year that at an organisational level there is a greater 
focus on the role of Credit, Risk, Compliance, Audit and 
other enabling functions, and that focus continues.
Compassion
I would end by thanking my colleagues, who have given 
their utmost to the Bank in two of the most trying years 
in human history, and all our stakeholders who have kept 
their faith in us. Yes, business and professional goals are 
essential. However, it is even more essential to not lose the 
human touch at the workplace and in our personal lives. 
Compassion, care and understanding enrich both the giver 
and the receiver. Thank you all once again.
Conclusion
HDFC Bank already had a huge opportunity with the 
under-penetration of banking services in the country. The 
proposed merger adds an entirely different dimension to 
the future. We believe that the runway is huge, and we 
can potentially add an HDFC Bank every five years. We 
are excited about the future and are confident that we will 
continue to have all our stakeholders’ support and trust, as 
we embark on this exciting new journey.

Financial Performance
Setting new 
growth benchmarks
The hallmark of the Bank's financial 
performance has been consistent growth 
across all key metrics, which has helped 
consolidate its leadership position. Its 
Balance Sheet continues to be healthy 
and strong which is evident by a growth of 
18.4% in the current year. 
The endeavour to reach all customers across India has 
contributed to an increase in branches to 6,342 as at the 
year end. This together with our ability to understand and 
fulfil customers' financial needs along with management 
of customer relationships has led to an overall increase of 
16.8% in Deposits and 20.8% in Advances. The continuous 
monitoring of costs and building of operational efficiencies 
has resulted in only a marginal increase of 0.60% in the Cost 
to Income Ratio to 36.9%. 
The asset mix of the Bank has shifted to high rated but low 
yielding segments.
Consequently, the Net Interest Margin has reduced 
marginally to 4.0%. It is pertinent to note that the change 
in asset mix has a positive impact on the net credit margin 
which has increased to 3.3% in the current year.
The impact of our effective risk management system along 
with robust credit policy and underwriting skills can be seen 
in the quality of our assets and low GNPA ratio of 1.17%. 
Even with a low GNPA, as a responsible banker, specific 
provision coverage has been increased to 72.7% and the 
coverage of total provisions comprised of specific, floating, 
contingent and general provisions, has been increased to 
182% as at the year end.
We continue to deliver double-digit growth both in earnings 
and return on equity. The Profit After Tax has grown by 
18.8% and return on equity has increased to 16.9%.

Emerging Growth Engine
Commercial and Rural Banking
The Bank's Commercial and Rural Banking (CRB) group 
was set up in the last financial year to cater to the needs 
of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) 
emerging corporates, commercial agriculture, small and 
marginal farmers, healthcare finance, equipment finance 
and commercial transport companies. While these are 
different businesses, the common thread binding them 
is that they all have a huge footprint in Semi Urban and 
Rural (SURU) India. As has the Bank with about half 
its branches in SURU locations. This vertical is also 
important as its disbursals help the Bank in meeting a 
large part of the Priority Sector Lending requirements. 
CRB has been identified as a growth engine and was 
the fastest growing vertical for the bank in the year 
under review. A wide reach across geographies of the 
country – district by district and understanding of local 
level business dynamics has helped it in achieving growth 
rates that exceed the industry average. The Bank at 
present has 6,300+ branches of which over 5,300+ have 
loans outstanding to MSME customers. The sourcing 
model through branch channels allied to traditional 
prudence is one of the key reasons for containing 
NPAs. A well trained relationship team does frequent 
interaction with MSME customers for their overall 
banking requirements including the personal banking of 
promoters and family members. 
In the rural segment, the Bank is planning to expand 
its services to 2 Lakh villages in the next two years. It 
funds not only traditional agriculture but also allied 
activities. It is totally committed to furthering the 
Government’s agenda by supporting its various 
schemes be it AIF/FPO/PMFME and lending to 
small and marginal farmers. 
HDFC Bank is the leading player in the commercial 
vehicle financing business with its share increasing 
considerably in the year ended March 31, 2022. It will be 
focusing on increasing market share further by expanding 
into deeper geographies and hiring more feet on street. 
The Bank has also established a robust healthcare 
ecosystem to capture high potential offered by hospitals, 
nursing homes, pathologies, laboratories, chemists, 
doctors and patient finance. 
The CRB vertical shall continue contributing to the bank’s 
growth as well as the nation’s growth through its bouquet 
of products.

Materiality Assessment
Prioritising issues that matter
We conducted a materiality 
assessment exercise, in 
accordance with GRI standards, in 
FY19 to identify the most important 
topics that could significantly 
impact our value creation. Inputs 
gathered from key stakeholders 
were factored into our strategy 
planning. Taking a step further in 
FY21, we modified our materiality 
study to align our ESG strategy 
with business goals, by including 
emerging topics such as climate 
change risks and opportunities.

Transparency 
and disclosure
GRI aspects: General disclosure - 
Reporting practice
Capitals impacted: 
With the increased demand for ESG disclosures among stakeholders, it is critical to ensure that such 
reporting is accurate and reliable. We have a sustainability strategy and reporting programme in place 
that clearly articulates our sustainability strategy, risks, and opportunities, as well as performance on 
material ESG topics.
We also place high value on report assurance, so our Sustainability Report and Green House Gas (GHG) 
emissions are verified by third-party auditors in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance 
Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (revised) Standards.
15.
Economic 
performance
GRI aspects: Economic performance
Capitals impacted: 
Economic performance is critical to maintain stability and positive momentum. We strive to provide our 
stakeholders with increased long-term value. Even during challenging times, we have performed well, 
aided by our prudent management and capital allocation strategies.

GRI aspects: General Disclosure - 
Governance
Capitals impacted: 
Through the effective use of processes, information and technology, we have deployed a multi-layered 
risk management strategy that identifies, assesses, monitors and manages risks (credit, market, 
liquidity, interest rate, and operational). A Board-approved Stress Testing Policy & System, which is 
an integral aspect of our ICAAP, is part of our overall risk management framework (Internal Capital 
Adequacy Assessment Process). Stress testing is done by employing a variety of ways to determine 
our vulnerability to excessive yet realistically stressful scenarios. Additionally, we use a SEMS (Social & 
Environmental Management System) framework to analyse social and environmental credit risks. Risk 
exposures are actively identified and reported to the appropriate levels of management, so that risk 
mitigation actions can be implemented. The risk management function is independent of business and 
reports directly to the Managing Director.

Financial 
inclusion
GRI aspects: Economic performance; Local 
communities
Capitals impacted: 
Financial inclusion is key to India’s inclusive development agenda. The banking sector has a pivotal 
role to play in serving the underbanked, especially in rural and semi-urban areas. We see this as an 
opportunity to broaden our reach and make our products and services more accessible. While we 
continue to focus on the Corporate Cluster and Government Business to increase penetration, we see 
Commercial (MSME) and Rural Banking driving the next wave of growth. 
11.

Responsible 
financing
GRI aspects: Environmental compliance;

process. Large industrial/infrastructure projects where the extension of long-term financing (greater than 
`100 Million and longer than 5 years) are covered under the Bank’s Social & Environment Monitoring 
System (SEMS) which necessitates an assessment of Environmental, Health, Social, and Safety risks in 
addition to other risks, as part of the overall credit appraisal process. 
As a rule, we do not fund projects that have a negative impact on the environment, health, or safety. We 
want to make funding available for environmentally viable projects that help mitigate climate change risks. 
To reduce our carbon footprint, we continue to invest in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. 
Customers are also encouraged to make ‘green banking’ decisions.
12.
Employee 
welfare
GRI aspects: Employment
Capitals impacted: 
W We engage with employees and their families through a variety of initatives through our Employee 
Connect program. Over the years and especially during the pandemic, we saw a significant increase in 
the employee participation. Many of these initiatives were virtually run during the last two years to ensure 
employee safety. We also run an Employee Welfare Trust which is primarily set up to support employees 
in case of emergencies where the expenses extend beyond the mediclaim cover that we provide to all 
employees and their families. During the pandemic, support from the trust was generously extended to 
all employees who needed it.

Re-imagining Retail Branch 
Banking
Our growing phygital reimagined 
branch channel is pivotal to our 
strategic intent of being India’s best 
customer-centric brand across 
industries, within the next three years. 
Retail Branch banking is the key 
enabler for retail deposits, retail trade 
and forex business, unsecured and 
secured asset business and third-party 
distribution business. We continue to 
reimagine our branch channel backed 
by micro market focused multiformat 
distribution science, phygital 
transformation, analytics and Artificial 
Intelligence (AI). This is backed by an 
institutionalised approach to customer 
life cycle management and a ‘Service 
First culture’.
The levers that bring to life our 
reimagining branch channel 
strategy are:
Holistic customer life cycle 
management
It starts from our ability to map and 
source the right set of customers using 
a differentiated go-to-market approach 
and results in having need-based 
conversations and offering the right 
product proposition. It also entails 
continually nourishing the relationship 
through our relationship management 
architecture and recommending next 
best actions and implementing them. 
Our 'service first culture' is embedded 
throughout the customer life cycle 
management journey.
Analytics led customer 
conversations and distribution 
planning tool
Our approach is based on ‘Needbased Selling’ and is empowered by 
robust analytical tools and AI. 'Next 
Best Actions', are suggested based 
on a study of customer transactions/
digital behavior across the Bank's 
digital assets. Further, relationship 
managers are equipped with 
suggestive 'Immediate Next Best 
Actions', based on real time digital 
transactions/customers interactions.
Our micro market focused multiformat 
scientific study of data drives decisions 
on meeting customer needs through 
retail phygital branch/Digital Banking 
Units/‘Smart Banking Lobby’ or 
Business Correspondents. An 
optimum mix of digitisation along with 
relevant human interactions, enables 
us to deliver superior services.
Digitisation of sales, service and 
Branch operations
We continue to embed and enhance 
customer digital journeys, be it sales, 
service or operations. It also entails 
enhancing phygital through digital 
delivery in physical branches.
Mobile-first approach leveraging 
Aadhaar and ‘Walk Out Working’ 
(WOW) straight through journeys, are 
some of the initiatives that are helping 
us achieve significant benefits, in terms 
of improved customer experience 
along with cost reduction. WOW 
customer service journeys have scaled 
up customer adoption by ~45% 
(cumulative) and is expected to grow 
further.
Customer Experience 
Excellence
The cornerstone of Customer 
Experience Excellence is to delight 
customers at every touch point. In 
this endeavour, our initiatives include 
process simplification through 
digitisation, reimagining the customer 
journeys and making them userfriendly. We are enhancing self-service 
avenues and thus empowering 
customers in completing paperless 
journeys on their own. Our Net 
Promoter Score, a metric of measuring 
customer satisfaction and loyalty, has 
shown 22% improvement over FY21.

People capability
Our people are the face of the Bank. 
Our aim is to strengthen our teams 
to better understand the ‘Voice of 
Customer’ to enable us to create 
newer propositions, simpler processes 
and seamless customer experiences. 
We have equipped our teams with AI 
and analytics-driven pinpointed regular 
customer level analysis to enable 
enhanced engagement. Further, we 
continue to train our teams through 
interactive learning interventions that 
equip them to enhance customer 
delight in all their interactions. The 
learning interventions are customised 
based on analytics.
Virtual Relationship 
Management
As a future-ready Bank, we have 
further strengthened our Virtual 
Relationship Management (VRM) 
channel to enhance customer 
engagement and provide seamless 
customer service experience. A 
banking experience with digital 
ease and personalised need based 
conversations, is at the core of our 
VRM strategy. The Virtual Relationship 
Management practice is an integrated 
customer-centric approach consisting 
of three pillars:
 · Virtual Relationship
 · Virtual Sales
 · Virtual Care
The Virtual Relationship Managers 
serve the customer life cycle across – 
a) Save b) Invest c) Borrow d) Transact 
e) Engage. We believe that we have a 
head start with our Virtual Relationship 
Management practice, leveraging an 
Omnichannel Engagement framework, 
seamless digital journeys, data 
science-led customer interactions 
and a robust talent pool of welltrained Virtual Relationship Managers. 
Your Bank has made significant 
investments in technology upgradation 
of the customer facing solutions 
around Interactive Voice Response 
Systems, Data Management and 
digital engagement platforms like 
Video KYC, to offer a world-class 
virtual engagement framework 
for its customers. Our systems 
are structured, secure, compliant, 
automated and avoid any data 
leakages. Our VRM framework 
provides seamless 24/7 access to 
customers and experiences, in line 
with global service standards.
We provide automated interactive voice 
response solution in 12 languages with 
20+ services. We offer world-class 
service interaction, with an analyticsled need-based product distribution 
approach, aimed at making us the 
preferred banker of choice for the 
customer.
Our Virtual Care approach is an 
extension of our customer-centric 
programme — ‘Infinite Smiles' and 
we aim for customer satisfaction in 
every interaction. We have progressed 
further on our conscious journey 
of a culture transformation, which 
is enshrined along with the critical 
leadership tenets of ‘Nurture, Care and 
Collaborate’. This has also contributed 
to better complaints management and 
reduced customer wait time.
Government and 
Institutions Business
Growing focus on digitisation of 
transactions and Government 
push towards transparency offers 
an enormous opportunity in this 
segment. We aim to capitalise on 
this opportunity by focusing on the 
following key areas:
Strategy in Action
Start-ups
Education, 
healthcare, religious 
institutions, NGOs, 
trusts, and housing 
societies 
Central, State and 
local Governments 
and associated 
entities
Alternate 
Channels & 
Partnerships
Financial 
inclusion
Government 
and 
Institutions 
Business

The Government of India has unlocked 
a large revenue pool by allowing private 
sector banks to participate across all 
areas of Government business. We are 
a leading bank in managing Government 
fund flows, with ~26% of total flows routed 
through the Bank. The single nodal agency 
construct introduced in September 2021 
by GOI will further augment these flows. 
We are leveraging our extensive reach, 
intuitive technological solutions, our 
deep network, and sustainable livelihood 
initiatives to maximise this opportunity. 
We facilitate digitisation of agricultural 
procurements, 
e-governance 
for 
tendering and auction, amongst others, 
and offer a differentiated and seamless 
experience for Government bodies. In 
FY22, the Bank was recognised as one of 
the top 5 Banks in the country processing 
pay-outs, including direct benefit transfer 
under the single nodal agency construct 
by the Ministry of Finance to enable this. 
The Bank has facilitated and/or developed 
the necessary technological solutions to 
provide customers with a high quality user 
experience. 
Our comprehensive digital suite also 
acts as a catalyst driving growth in the 
institutional business. We have adopted 
an ecosystem-based approach to harness 
the growing opportunities in educational 
institutions, religious institutions, and 
housing societies. We enable collections 
of society payments, donations, fees, as 
well as manage payments to vendors, 
employees, etc. We have also forged 
partnerships with tech players to adopt 
an API-based approach to cater to the 
needs of this segment. 
Parallelly, we are making continuous 
investments to expand our distribution 
network in the deep geographies of the 
country. Rapid adoption of technology 
coupled with deep penetration of mobile 
and internet provides fertile ground to tap 
into opportunities, by digitally connecting 
the last mile. Till date we have on-boarded 
4 Lakh+ Village Level Entrepreneurs (VLE) 
as Business Facilitators and Business 
Correspondents to help source business 
for us. With the help of the VLEs, we have 
been able to create a large distribution 
network to capture the opportunities 
in the semi-urban and rural areas. Our 
octopus model of distribution puts existing 
branches at the core, supported by 
agents empanelled through marquee tieups and partnerships. These agents are 
capacitated by the Bank through digital 
infrastructure, branding and visibility 
to function as a mini branch. Digitallyassisted and unassisted journeys are in 
play, with a combination of fintech and 
APIs that deliver a seamless experience 
securely. These alternate channels not 
only create value for the Bank but also 
have a larger societal impact supporting 
nation-building and the Government’s 
financial inclusion agenda.
Leadership in Payments 
Business
Payments business is an integrated 
business with key wheels of Issuance,

Strategy in Action
PayZapp Wallet, EMI and EPI/Direct 
Pay. Customer spends have crossed 
8 Lakh Crore in FY 22 with 63 Million+ 
cards (Credit Cards, Debit Cards 
and prepaid cards) addressing every 
market segment. Every third rupee 
spent on cards in India, happens 
on HDFC Bank cards. Adapting to 
the changing customer behaviours, 
we have expanded our customer 
offerings. We are a leading player in 
credit cards with a strong growth and 
market share on both booksize/ENR 
and spends. We have the best suite 
of cards curated for the needs of both 
young professionals and ultra premium 
customers. Digitally enhancing 
customer experience and services for 
our customers is a key strategy and 
we launched ‘MyCards’ application 
to help card customers to self service 
digitally. Our future plan is to fortify the 
MyCards offering to a comprehensive 
Cards servicing solution for the Credit 
Card and Debit Card customers. 
PayZapp is a key strategy to drive 
customer engagement across all 
payment forms. It will be providing 
a strong, unified experience across 
contactless payments, QR-based 
payments, UPI payments, and BNPL, 
and will be digitising all payment form 
factors with rich features on a unified 
platform. The revamped PayZapp 
2 is around the corner and will be 
providing a unified experience across 
contactless payments. Smartbuy 
continues to play a key role in 
providing a strong loyalty framework 
and has gained popularity among 
customers for providing accelerated 
reward points and reward redemptions 
on a single platform. To complete our 
suite of products and payment suite to 
the retail consumers, we are scaling 
BNPL with multiple variants that we are 
building to make customer purchases 
convenient. Between Credit Card EMI, 
Debit Card EMI and paper financing, 
we are riding the wave of innovation 
and have become No.1 among all 
banks in BNPL. 
Acceptance business is all about 
building the core network connecting 
the entire payment ecosystem and 
receipts business. Our full suite of 
online and offline payment solutions 
consists of Payment gateway, UPI, 
EPI, Smart Hub platform, POS/M 
POS, QR Code and Scan & Pay, 
among others. Within acceptance 
business, Merchant Acquiring 
business provides the railroad for 
banking solutions and payment 
offerings to the largest customer 
segment – MSMEs. As a Bank, 
this business gets us entry into the 
large and thriving MSME ecosystem 
that forms the backbone of our 
economy. We have been leading this 
business and despite the disruptive 
competition in this space, we have 
about 47% market share in cards, 
1 Million+ POS terminals deployed 
and 14.5 Lakh Crore+ volume 
acquired across cards, NetBanking 
and UPI. We are strengthening our 
Partnership pillar by forging alliances 
with large fintech players to corner 
large opportunity segments with 
targeted value propositions like EMI, 
pay later and digital storefronts. 
Smart Hub continues to be a pioneer 
comprehensive payment and banking 
solution for all merchants, and we will 
be launching the enhanced Smart 
Hub App Platform soon. We have 
been continuously transforming the 
experience on SmartHub Vyapar 
App platform to instantly become a 
merchant with the widest range of 
payment acceptance, easy access 
to loans and banking solutions with a 
single view of all transactions. Further, 
the platform will allow merchants to 
instantly open current account and 
start accepting payments on the go.
Consumer Financing consists of 
lending at the point of sale i.e. the 
EMI business, and this business 
feeds off the acceptance and 
issuance business. We fund both 
during purchase and post purchase 
transactions through cutting-edge 
offerings such as Cards EMI, Buy 
now Pay later (BNPL), digital loans, 
Smart EMI – Credit, Smart EMI – 
Debit and inventory finance, among 
others. We are reaching out to New to 
Credit (NTC) customers and new age 
customers, extensively in this space.
Technology and digital
As a future-ready bank, we are 
technology and digital led in most of 
our operations. Today, 93% of the 
Bank’s transactions are processed 
digitally. As a part of our technology 
transformation agenda, we have taken 
great strides under the three legs of 
Digital Factory, Enterprise Factory 
and Enterprise IT. While Enterprise 
Factory and Enterprise IT focus on 
strengthening the core technologies 
and networks, Digital factory is aimed 
at enhancing customer experience 
through differentiated products and 
services. This approach is further 
illustrated through our 5-pillar strategy 
for bringing in key shifts in the banking 
experience.
We aim to make day-to-day banking 
simple for our retail customers through 
easy and unified payment experiences 
and seamless assisted and unassisted 
journeys. Our ecosystem-based

We are ‘hollowing out the core’ by 
moving away from legacy systems into 
a cloud native, agile system, and a 
neo-technology stack.
Our people are the most important 
enablers as we transform into a 
future-ready, digital-first bank. We 
are refreshing our people practices 
adapting to new ways of working. Our 
hiring strategies leverage Gen X to Gen 
Z talent offering diverse skillsets to

Our focus is on fostering a culture of 
innovation, agility and growth.
The Bank has lined up exciting 
launches in the coming quarters

banking simpler but also augment 
the experience through value added 
services. Our MobileBanking app is 
undergoing a massive re-write with a 
refreshed UI/UX focusing on journey 
simplification for the customer. The 
end goal is simple, customer delight 
across all segments on the back of a 
resilient infrastructure and seamless 
digital experiences.

Strategy in Action
Commercial & Rural Banking 
Commercial and Rural Banking 
(CRB) primarily caters to entities in 
manufacturing, exports, employment, 
retail and trade, supply chain network 
and infrastructure. CRB lending 
constitutes a large part of our PSL 
lending book. CRB serves Micro, Small 
and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), 
emerging corporates, commercial 
agriculture, farmer finance, healthcare 
finance, equipment finance and 
commercial transport companies. 
We are committed to helping resolve 
the challenges faced by this market 
segment, like lack of easy or timely 
access to credit, high cost of credit 
and collateral constraints.
This group enables acquisition of 
customer at an early stage. For 
instance today’s SME and MSME 
will transition to tomorrow’s midcorporates and large corporates. The 
Bank aims to support the journeys 
of these companies as they mature 
through the lifecycle.
The rise of the digitally-enabled 
customers presents a unique 
opportunity to scale business 
and increase wallet share through 
augmented end-to-end digital journeys 
and increasingly personalised offerings 
and services. With products and 
platforms such as the SME portal, 
the Bank caters to the needs of 
the new-age customer. The Bank 
intends to grow its agriculture and 
allied book by diversifying its portfolio 
from staple crops to agri allied and 
high value horticulture crops. It also 
plans to augment as well as facilitate 
the growth of individual ecosystems 
that exist within the group, (such 
as the rural ecosystem, healthcare 
ecosystem, transportation ecosystem 
or the supply chain network) with 
products and services tailored to 
add value and financial strength. 
The market potential in the segment 
that the CRB group caters to is 
immense and the Bank is well-poised 
to capitalise on this opportunity 
by leveraging its reach, innovation 
capabilities, digital prowess and 
ecosystem offerings.
Retail Assets
Our Retail assets strategy is to 
deliver best-in-class algorithm-driven 
Digital lending. We continue to be 
a responsible, agile and innovative 
retail services provider. Our portfolio 
consists of secured/unsecured lending 
products such as auto loans, home 
loans, personal loans, gold loans, etc. 
to cater to various classes of retail 
customers. We aim to expand across 
newer geographies and deepen our 
presence in existing geographies 
through a customer centric approach, 
prudent pricing, introducing indigenous 
digital products while maintaining the 
quality of our portfolio. Our increased 
end-to-end digital lending journey 
across most of our products, backed 
by robust credit research, analytics 
and strong IT infrastructure, is enabling 
our consistent growth.

Wealth
Wealth is one of the key focus areas 
for the Bank. We are focused on the 
Affluent and Mass Affluent segment 
of customers to drive growth. A 
large proportion of wealth in India is 
distributed even beyond the top 20 
cities of the country. The Bank aims to 
increase the Wealth Relationship team 
and expand its reach in B30 (beyond 
top 30) cities, to tap into this segment 
through a hub and spoke model. 
The Bank’s Wealth team is currently 
serving customers across 216 cities 
and is on track to reach 800+ locations 
by the end of this financial year. We are 
also investing in our people through 
intensive training to develop the right 
knowledge capital and service skillsets 
to provide consistent quality of service 
across these locations.
Our dedicated service team for Wealth 
Clients ensures delivery of our 'Service 
First' philosophy. The bank has 
adopted Annual Recurring Revenue 
(ARR) as a key metric to ensure 
transition from transactional approach 
to portfolio management approach 
and minimise churn. We have an open 
architecture for insurance where we 
have multiple partners across life, 
health, and general insurance to offer 
the right product to the right customer. 
Our non-proprietary framework across 
investment products which makes 
recommendations based on robust 
quantitative and qualitative evaluation 
model, re-accentuate our customer 
centricity.
We are developing a mobile-first 
Wealth Platform that will leverage 
advanced analytics and AI-driven 
recommendations to provide 
differentiated wealth solutions across 
all customer segments. The digital 
platform will focus on agile, unassisted 
journeys and mass personalisation 
to cater to customers across the 
country. The goal is to deliver a

External Environment
Key external drivers and 
our response
Just as the global economy prepared to 
leave behind the pangs of the pandemic 
(despite uncertainties associated with 
subsequent waves and rising inflationary 
pressures), the Russia-Ukraine conflict 
escalated. The consequent imposition 
of sanctions on Russia kept the global 
economy and financial system on 
tenterhooks. Further, China’s slowdown, 
Sri Lanka’s crisis and other geopolitical 
issues continue to weigh on the economic 
recovery, clouding India’s near-term 
growth outlook as well.
The Indian banking sector, supported by regulatory and 
Government interventions, has remained resilient and 
sufficiently capitalised. Measures such as moratorium on 
payment of loan instalments and restructuring of loans, 
among others, alleviated the stress while helping banks 
to continue lending to productive sectors. The pandemic 
has accelerated the technology-led transformation in the 
financial services space, with new customised products and 
services being delivered using digital technologies. However, 
it has also elevated the risks related to data privacy and 
cyber security which need to be mitigated on an ongoing 
basis.

Global economic growth 
set to moderate 
The protracted Russia-Ukraine 
conflict, Sri Lanka’s sovereign default 
and structural slowdown in China 
are weighing heavily on the global 
economic recovery. Inflationary 
pressures have increased, as supply 
chains remain in disarray and trade 
sanctions on Russia push up energy 
prices. While Brent crude oil is 
hovering above $120/bbl, natural gas 
price has risen by more than 50% 
since March 2022. In response, many 
central banks including the US Federal 
Reserve, have tightened their monetary 
policy. Against such a backdrop, the 
IMF expects global GDP growth to 
moderate to 3.6% in 2022 from 6.1% 
in 2021. Among advanced economies, 
the US is expected to grow at 3.7% 
(vs. 5.7% in 2021), while Euro area 
growth is estimated to halve from 
5.3% in 2021 and the UK economy is 
estimated to grow at 3.7% in 2022 vs. 
7.4% in 2021. While Russia is expected 
to record a negative output growth, 
China is expected to grow at 4.4% vs. 
8.1% in 2021.
In India, export growth may see a 
moderation post a good performance 
last year. Inflation is expected to remain 
high due to rising input costs, lingering 
supply disruptions and elevated energy 
prices. The recent rate hikes by the 
RBI may put upward pressure on 
interest cost and weigh on investments 
and consumption. Additionally, global 
liquidity withdrawal presents a risk for 
foreign capital flows. In India, GDP 
growth is estimated at 7.3% in FY23 
vs. 8.7% in FY22, with risks tilted to 
the downside. Encouragingly, despite 
the slowdown, in FY23, India is likely 
to perform better than its Emerging 
Market peers. While zero COVID-19 
policy and related lock downs are 
likely to drag down China's economy, 
developing European countries (like 
Poland) are likely to suffer due to the 
ongoing war.
 Our response
We undertake topical stress testing 
based on prevailing geopolitical/
macroeconomic/sectoral and other 
trends. One such topical stress 
analysis was conducted to estimate 
the impact – direct and indirect – 
of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on 
our portfolio. We do not see any 
significant risk, based on the current 
information available. We, as part of 
our continuous and robust country 
risk monitoring, have proactively 
taken steps to limit our exposure 
to Sri Lanka. Nonetheless, we are 
closely monitoring the overall situation 
both at the global and India level and 
are modifying our course of action 
accordingly.

institutions. While the restructuring 
of large borrower accounts under RF

31, 2020 and implemented within 180 
days from the date of invocation, they 
have time till September 30, 2022 to 
achieve the operational parameters. 
On the other hand, resolutions under 
RF 2.0 for individuals, small businesses 
and MSMEs could be invoked before 
September 30, 2021 and the resolution 
plan had to be implemented within 90 
days from the date of invocation.

External Environment
Data privacy and 
cyber security 
The exponential growth of digitisation 
and technological transformation 
in financial services has escalated 
cyber security risk and data privacy 
concerns. There is a growing 
regulatory focus on safe practices and 
stringent polices within organisations 
to ensure that customer interest is 
safeguarded. With the advent of open 
banking, ecosystem banking, digital 
payments and lending, the importance 
of having a robust IT infrastructure with 
resilient systems and stringent policies 
cannot be over-emphasised.
Climate change 
and ESG
Climate change has emerged as an 
overarching concern, enveloping all 
aspects of humanity.
Naturally, this concerns the financial 
sector too. With the disruptive impact of 
climate-related events already evident, 
there is a worldwide movement to embed 
sustainability practices in business 
operations across Environmental, Social 
and Governance (ESG) aspects. The 
financial services industry is expected to 
factor ESG and climate-related physical 
and transition risks in decision-making. 
Further, India reiterated its commitment 
to climate action at the United Climate 
Change Conference (COP26) in 
November 2021 at Glasgow. In line with 
this, the RBI published a statement to 
support the greening of India’s financial 
system. This may significantly impact the 
policies and processes of the financial 
services industry.

We have a comprehensive ESG 
framework to address and mitigate 
climate-related and other ESG risks. 
It consists of a robust governance 
structure that ensures oversight 
over ESG matters at the highest 
level. We have made progress on 
energy consumption, emissions 
and tree plantation initiatives 
and aim to stay the course in 
the coming years. In FY22, we 
pledged to become carbon neutral 
by FY32 and are putting in place 
an implementation framework to 
achieve carbon neutrality. We are 
also in the process of adopting 
a broad range of technological 
solutions and operational measures 
to reduce energy consumption at 
our operating locations.

Evaluation of environmental and social 
risks is an integral part of our overall 
credit appraisal and approval process. 
Large industrial/infrastructure projects 
that require long-term financing 
(greater than H100 Million and longer 
than 5 years) are covered under our 
Social & Environment Monitoring 
System (SEMS). SEMS necessitates an 
assessment of Environmental, Health, 
Social and Safety risks in addition 
to other risks as part of the overall 
credit appraisal process. Further, 
we continue to invest in renewable 
energy and energy efficiency projects 
to lower our carbon footprint. We also 
encourage customers to make ‘green 
banking’ choices.
We have a dedicated Information 
Security Group headed by the Chief 
Information Security Officer and 
an Information Security Committee 
chaired by the Chief Risk Officer for 
exercising governance over these 
matters. We have devised and 
implemented data privacy policies 
with respect to customer data which 
includes usage of the Bank’s digital 
platforms. We are committed towards 
protecting privacy of our customer’s 
personal data. Our Data Privacy 
program provides a common set of 
requirements for processing personal 
data within Bank. Through our Privacy 
Notices, we attempt to explain in a 
transparent way how and why we 
collect, store and use personal data; 
how it might be shared, and legal 
grounds for processing personal data. 
Our response
We have stringent policies and 
processes in place to ensure 
information and cyber security. 
We undertake routine vulnerability 
assessments that include patch 
management, penetration testing and 
network security processes to ensure 
a robust system and IT infrastructure. 
We have implemented 24x7 
defacement monitoring and 
vulnerability management of the 
Bank’s internet properties. This 
minimises the surface area for cyber 
security attacks. Further Security 
Orchestration, Automation & Response 
(SOAR) is being used to reduce the 
incident response time by connecting 
security solutions with each other and 
automating the incident lifecycle.

Digital innovation in 
financial services 
The pandemic has brought about a 
shift in digital technology adoption, 
opening up many opportunities in 
the financial sector. Digital lending is 
one such opportunity, where many 
platforms have emerged to offer 
hassle-free loans to retail individuals, 
small traders and other borrowers. 
Many large multinational corporations 
whose primary business is technology 
(e-commerce, social media, payments 
enablers, etc.), popularly known as 
BigTechs, have started lending either 
directly or in partnership with regulated 
financial entities. 
~6,000
FINTECH PLAYERS OFFERING SERVICES ACROSS 
INVESTMENTS, INSURANCE, PAYMENTS, LENDING 
AND BANKING INFRASTRUCTURE
Further, the Indian fintech market is 
slated to grow significantly due to 
large unpenetrated geographies and 
rapid digitisation of the economy. With 
~6,000 fintech players, the services 
offered are spread across investment, 
insurance, payments, lending, 
and banking infrastructure. With 
cutting-edge technology and niche 
target markets, these fintechs offer 
customised and user-friendly services 
that appeal to the growing techsavvy customer base. The regulatory 
environment is providing the necessary 
impetus with initiatives such as the 
e-RUPI, a person and purpose-specific 
digital payment solution launched in 
August 2021. In the Union budget of 
2022-23, India has announced plans 
for a Central Bank Digital Currency 
(CBDC). Additionally, open banking 
trends and a spurt in the number of 
off-the-shelf APIs available for banks 
and third-party apps to build upon is 
changing the dynamics of financial 
services industry. 
We are focusing on building new 
competencies under Digital Factory, 
Enterprise Factory and Enterprise IT. 
We are fully geared up to launch the 
next phase of our strategic initiatives to 
provide seamless customer journeys. We 
are continuously innovating to provide 
differentiated customer offerings. Through 
digitisation we are offering solutions 
to enable ease of business across our 
diverse customer base. We are focusing 
on end to end digital journeys with 
omni channel touchpoints designed 
around the needs of our customers. We 
launched ‘Xpress Car Loans’ – our new 
car loan journey for existing customers 
as well as non-customers, resulting in 
loan initiation to disbursal in less than 
30 mins. We are fostering innovation 
with strategic partnerships with multiple 
cutting edge startups, Fintechs and 
BigTechs to increase the breadth of such 
holistic offerings. Benefits such as an 
enhanced digital customer experience, 
more intuitive user interfaces and neo 
tech stacks are pivotal enablers in our 
partnership journeys. This has recently 
been demonstrated through the roll out 
of our Smart Hub Vyapar offering for 
merchant ecosystems and our revamped 
Customer Experience Hub, an AI/ML 
Powered Omni Customer Experience 
Transformation program. Our core 
technology transformation program is 
continually strengthened with new age 
technology advancements being built into 
our roadmap including our Cloudification, 
API, Automation and App modernization 
journeys.

Risk Management
Robust and stresstested framework 
Our robust Risk Management framework and the independence of 
our risk management function set us apart as a responsible banker. 
It enables the execution of our strategic priorities without taking on 
undue financial and non-financial risks. Our risk policies and processes 
and their effective implementation through technology and governance 
enabled us to endure and even grow in these highly uncertain and 
disruptive times. Stress testing is one of the key risk management tools 
we use to mitigate and manage the existing as well as emerging risks.

Risk Governance
Our Board of Directors is responsible 
for managing comprehensive 
risks. The Risk Policy & Monitoring 
Committee (RPMC), constituted by the 
Board, oversees the implementation 
of our risk strategy. The RPMC guides 
the development of our policies, 
procedures and systems and evaluates 
their adequacy and appropriateness to 
the changing business conditions, as 
well as our risk appetite. 
The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) heads the 
independent Risk Management Group 
(RMG). The CRO interacts regularly 
with the members of the RPMC. 
The RMG is primarily responsible 
for implementing the risk strategy 
approved by the Board, and 
developing policies, procedures and 
systems for identifying, measuring, 
monitoring, assessing and managing 
risks.
Risk frameworks and their 
implementation
The nature of our business and 
business activities, along with the 
regulatory environment and external 
environment at large, exposes us 
to several types of risks. For us, the 
keys risks are credit risk, market risk, 
liquidity risk, operational risk, cyber 
security and data risk. Our operations 
expose us to compliance and 
reputation risk. We are also exposed 
to ESG risks. We have put in place an 
aggregate risk appetite framework. In 
addition, the appetites for individual 
risk types are operationalised through 
risk-specific policies, limits and 
triggers. 
We also have a structured 
management framework in the Internal 
Capital Adequacy Assessment 
Process (ICAAP) to identify, assess 
and manage all risks that may have 
a material adverse impact on our 
business/financial position/capital 
adequacy.
Risk exposures are regularly captured 
and reported to the relevant levels 
of management for initiation of 
appropriate mitigation measures. We 
also continuously evaluate the efficacy 
of existing risk model assumptions and 
parameters and refine the models to 
keep up with the changing times.
We have an Internal Audit Department 
which is responsible for independently 
evaluating the adequacy and 
effectiveness of all internal controls, 
risk management, governance systems 
and processes.
We have separated the Risk, Audit 
and Compliance functions from the 
Business functions to create a strong 
culture of checks and balances and 
to eliminate any possible conflict of 
interest between revenue generation, 
and risk management and control.
Key risk management 
initiatives 
Evolving stress testing scenarios 
In addition to the existing suite of 
standard stress scenarios, we are 
conducting stress testing based on 
topical themes driven by prevailing 
trends such as geopolitical/
macroeconomic/sectoral, among 
others. These stress tests are 
conducted focusing on specific areas 
of portfolio and the results act as 
early warning alerts/signals for taking 
actions, if any. Some of the topical 
themes relevant for the present times 
include the evolving geopolitical turmoil 
in Europe due to the Russia-Ukraine 
conflict, commodity price shocks, and 
possible shift in key macroeconomic 
variables in the medium term. 
Russia-Ukraine conflict
We analysed both direct and indirect 
impact of the conflict on our portfolio. 
The situation remains fluid globally, and 
there is uncertainty regarding the final 
outcome from a geopolitical as well as 
a financial market standpoint. Stress 
testing of our portfolio considering the 
current information did not indicate any 
significant risk. We continue to closely 
monitor the situation, to pre-empt and 
manage the risk and its outcomes.
Sri Lanka’s sovereign default
With continuous and robust monitoring 
of country risk exposures and stress 
testing, we have proactively taken 
steps to limit our exposure to Sri 
Lanka. Although the impact of the 
default is unlikely to be material for the 
Bank, we are keeping a close eye on 
the situation.
Increasing focus on nonfinancial risks
We believe a lot more can be done 
in the area of researching, analysing, 
monitoring and mitigating nonfinancial risks such as operational, 
technology and reputation, among 
others. Accordingly, we are elevating 
deliberations of non-financial risks 
in the RPMC/Board. We are also in 
the process of enhancing policies, 
procedures and risk assessment 
framework for such non-financial risks. 
Leveraging technology
In line with our technology 
transformation agenda, we are also 
automating our risk management 
processes. We believe it will increase 
efficiencies, enhance accuracy of 
information, and enable maintenance 
of adequate audit trail for reviews.

The risk which arises from default by borrowers in their 
terms of contract with the Bank, especially failure to make 
payments or repayments.
Mitigation
An independent Credit Group headed by Chief Credit 
officer oversees the underwriting functions and approvals 
across retail and wholesale credit functions. It ensures that 
the credit underwriting and portfolio management policies 
are aligned with the Board approved credit appetite. There 
are robust policies and processes for managing credit risk 
in both retail and wholesale businesses, mainly through 
our target defined market, credit approval process, postdisbursement monitoring and remedial management 
procedures.
Strategies
Maintaining healthy asset quality with optimal risk-reward 
considerations.
Capitals Impacted
 
 
 
The risk of potential loss on account of adverse changes 
in market variables which affect the value of financial 
instruments held by the Bank.
These instruments are primarily held for trading or for 
management of statutory reserves.
Examples of such market instruments are debt securities, 
equities, foreign exchange and derivative instruments. 
Mitigation
A well-defined Board approved Market Risk Policy, 
Investment Policy, Foreign Exchange Trading Policy and 
Derivatives Policy along with robust control activities 
caps the risk at trading desk level and also at securities 
level, through trading risk limits in line with the Bank’s risk 
appetite.
The market risk is also evaluated at portfolio level and 
controls are implemented to mitigate the risk.
Strategies
Optimising profitability of mark-to-market products within the 
constraints of liquidity and market risk appetite of the Bank.
Capitals Impacted
 
The risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, as a result of 
failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and 
standards.
Mitigation
Comprehensive Board-approved Compliance policy in 
place which is reviewed on an annual basis.
The Compliance function tracks and reviews 
compliance with regulatory guidelines.
Enhancing the compliance culture within the 
organisation through an intricate and comprehensive 
internal control framework along with other measures.

Compliance Risk

Operational risk arises from inadequate or failed internal 
processes, people and systems or from external events. 
It includes risk of loss due to legal risk.
Mitigation
A Board-approved governance structure is in place with 
detailed framework and processes for managing operational 
risk. Under the framework, the Bank has three lines of 
defence namely business line (including support and 
operations), An independent Operational Risk Management 
Department (ORMD) and Internal Audit to manage, monitor 
and mitigate Operational risks.
Strategies
Minimising operational losses through risk mitigation 
mechanisms.
Capitals Impacted
 
 
At a broader level, risks from climate change are 
typically divided into:
 · Physical risks 
Economic losses (physical damage to property and 
assets) from extreme weather events (flood, cyclone, 
etc). due to climate change.
 · Transition risks 
– The possible process of adjustment to a low carbon 
economy and its possible effects on the value of 
financial assets and liabilities. 
Mitigation
An ESG policy framework has been formulated to 
address this risk.
Evaluation of environmental and social risk is an 
integral part of our overall credit appraisal and approval 
process. Long-term financing proposals for large 
industrial/infrastructure projects (greater than `100 
million and tenor above 5 years) are evaluated through 
the SEMS framework, which requires an assessment 
of Environmental, Health, Social, and Safety risks 
in addition to other risks as part of the overall credit 
appraisal process. We also track and externally verify 
our carbon emissions to effectively manage and 
reduce our footprint.
Strategies
We are exploring frameworks to model and assess 
climate risk. We also continue our endeavour to 
acquire granular data, further corroborated by BRSR 
data (from FY23 onwards), and test tools for climate 
risk assessment and conducting scenario analysis. We 
are also exploring options to tie-up with data providers.
On the emissions front, we have set ourselves specific 
targets towards reduction of our GHG emissions.

Robust information and cyber security practices for an uninterrupted 
march towards rapid digitisation
Governance over Data
As a responsible banker cyber security, 
and data privacy are of paramount 
importance to us. To manage these 
risks, we have constituted an IT 
Strategy Committee, Information 
Security Committee in addition to 
the Information Security Group with 
specific roles and responsibilities. We 
also have in place a cybersecurity 
framework and an information security 
programme. We undertake stringent 
processes and measures such as 
vulnerability management processes 
that actively scan for security threats, 
logging and monitoring procedures 
to deal with network intrusions and 
incidents. There were no incidents of 
data breaches In FY22.
We adhere to the ‘Code of Bank’s 
Commitment to Customers’ as 
prescribed by the Banking Codes 
and Standards Board of India 
(BCSBI) and Employee and Customer 
Awareness Procedures, to ensure 
customer privacy and are guided by 
our Information Security Policy and 
Cyber Security Policy, which is at par 
with global standards in information 
security.
Further we have an independent 
assurance team within Internal 
Audit which provides assurance 
on the management of information 
technology-related risks.
IT Strategy Committee
This committee looks into various 
technology related aspects. The 
functions of the Committee are to 
formulate IT strategy and related policy 
documents, ensure that IT strategy 
is aligned with business strategy. 
The committee comprises majorly of 
independent directors and includes an 
external information technology expert.
Information Security Committee
This Committee is chaired by the CRO 
(Chief Risk Officer) and is responsible 
to assess, accept and sponsor 
company-wide security investments. 
It provides a forum to discuss 
information security risks and acts as 
a custodian for the enterprise security 
programme. The committee meets 
on a quarterly basis with participation 
from IT, Business Operations, Audit, 
and the Information Security Group.
Information Security Programme
This programme is based on regulatory 
requirements (RBI Gopalakrishnan 
committee report) and industry 
standards (ISO 27001:2013 and NIST 
800-53). Our cybersecurity framework 
consists of components such as 
Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, 
and Recover which remind us of how 
important it is to balance proactive 
safeguards while preparing for worstcase scenarios.
Key objectives of the programme include:
 · Documenting, disseminating, 
operating, and reviewing information 
security policies, and procedures
 · Monitoring cyber security threats 
and reviewing the risk profile across 
all critical assets, infrastructure 
components and business units/
departments
 · Providing transparency into the 
information security programme 
and associated controls to senior 
management including board
 · Responding promptly to information 
security incidents and policy 
violations/exceptions in accordance 
with organisational policy
 · Determining whether the actions 
taken to resolve an incident were 
effective and whether corrective 
actions are required, and 
documenting lessons learnt
Key measures undertaken by 
us, to mitigate information 
security related risks are:
Antivirus/Malware Programme
We have implemented a programme 
to prevent, detect and react to 
the introduction of malicious code 
through sources such as computer 
viruses, worms, and Trojans. We use a 
combination of commercially available 
and proprietary tools and monitoring 
systems to mitigate the risks 
associated with malware. The antivirus 
signatures are updated more than 
once per day to stay current and cover 
workstations, servers, email gateways, 
web gateways.
Network Security
The Bank uses a combination of 
firewalls and proxy servers to separate 
and control traffic between networks 
with different security requirements 
and levels of trust. The Bank has 
intrusion detection/prevention 
capabilities in place to detect and react 
to known attacks in real time. IDS/IPS 
signatures are updated periodically to 
update detections for specific threats, 
intruder profiles, and attack patterns. 
These tools are configured to generate 
alerts when predefined thresholds are 
exceeded.
Business Continuity Management, Information 
& Cyber Security Practices

Vulnerability management
The Bank administrates a vulnerability 
management process that actively 
scans for security threats. The 
vulnerability management team 
is responsible for tracking and 
following up on vulnerabilities. Once a 
vulnerability requiring remediation has 
been identified, it is logged, prioritised 
according to severity, and assigned an 
owner. The vulnerability management 
team tracks such issues and follows 
up frequently until they can verify that 
the issues have been remediated.
Patch management
The Bank has patch management 
processes and tools to assess 
and deploy operating system and 
application specific patches and 
updates. This process includes steps 
to evaluate vendor supplied patches to 
determine servers that require patches 
and updates, to document procedures 
for patching and updating servers, 
and to deploy patches and updates in 
a timely manner to protect the Bank’s 
infrastructure.
Penetration testing
To test for potential vulnerabilities, 
penetration tests are conducted for all 
critical networks and systems within 
the Bank’s internal environment and 
for external applications. Penetration 
tests are triggered based on several 
events, including new releases, 
updates, or enhancements. The types 
of penetration tests that are conducted 
include Network/Host Penetration 
Testing and Application Penetration 
Testing.
Logging and monitoring
The Bank has a logging and monitoring 
procedure in place to deal with 
network intrusions and incidents. User 
actions, system activity and changes 
to the infrastructure are logged. Logs 
are stored securely and are protected 
against modification, deletion, and 
inappropriate access. The relative 
risk level of the asset and alerts are 
generated in the event of audit log 
failures. Monitoring tools aggregate the 
log files and suspicious activity events 
are automatically reported to the SOC 
(Security Operations Centre) team. 
The SOC team performs the following 
steps:
 · Analysis and Incident Detection – 
The SOC team collects information 
from the system generated event as 
well as other information sources to 
identify a potential incident
 · Event Tracking and Escalation – 
Events are assessed based on the 
level of risk and escalated based 
on guidance from the Incident 
Management policy; escalations 
include referral to the CIRT for indepth analysis and forensics and 
management for situation awareness
 · Reporting – The CSOC team 
periodically reports on events and 
incidents to management

Climate change is one of the 
most pertinent issues of our 
times. At HDFC Bank, we are 
continuously transforming our 
operations to achieve lowcarbon growth. We have set 
a target to achieve carbon 
neutrality for our Scope 1 and 
Scope 2 emissions by FY32 
and are formalising a roadmap 
covering phased emission and 
energy reduction targets.

Governance 
Our Board-governed environmental policy serves 
as a framework to understand and manage our 
environmental risks, impacts and opportunities. 
Our Board of Directors sets courses and evaluates 
our performance on social and environmental 
responsibility. We are continuously working to 
incorporate environmentally responsible practices 
in our own operations, through our vendors, as well 
as through responsible financing. No cases of noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations 
were identified during the year. We track our GHG 
emissions and transparently report our environmental 
performance annually.
Metrics and targets 
We monitor KPIs for all major environmental 
indicators and initiatives covering energy, GHG 
emissions, water and waste for all our operations and 
aim to minimise the environmental impact thereof. 
We report on climate-related disclosures through the 
Carbon Disclosure Project and our TCFD disclosures, 
which are included in this report. Towards this end, 
the Bank is formalising a roadmap to guide its journey 
towards carbon neutrality. The roadmap consists of 
phased emission and energy reduction targets. More 
details on this can be found in subsequent chapters. 
Notes:
#Base year for targets for energy and emissions: FY22.
*‘Carbon Neutral’ targets include the use of offsets and reflect 
neutrality over projected emissions in the corresponding year.
**Including both demand & supply measures
Our Scope 1 emissions includes emissions from fuel consumption 
in own vehicles and DG sets. Scope 2 emissions include emissions 
due to purchased electricity.
Energy consumption as discussed in this report includes energy 
consumed by the Bank within its operations – including electricity, 
and fuel consumed in DG sets at locations where it has operational 
control as well as its co-located data centres and company vehicles.
All targets are based on accelerated emission reduction scenario 
used in our integrated carbon neutrality roadmap.

Initiatives to reduce environmental footprint 
We are working to align our business operations with socially and environmentally responsible practices. 
We are incorporating both technological as well as process solutions in our day to day operations in 
order to add value to the quality of environment. 
GHG emissions and climate change 
Environment
At HDFC Bank, we have put in place an integrated strategy 
for managing our scope 1 and scope 2 emissions (refer 
page 69 and 70). As we had surpassed our previously set 
targets, we have taken on new targets with FY22 as base 
year. Our emission sources included in our base year GHG 
inventory demonstrates an enhancement of our ambitions 
and transparency goals. Not only have we ensured the 
completeness of our Scope 2 emissions from already 
identified source categories, but also included our colocated data centres as a source category for our scope 2 
emissions. Similarly, we have added a new source category 
for our Scope 3 emissions – emissions on account of 
electricity consumption at our other facilities.

Enhancements to our emissions boundary and scope
As a result of the enhanced boundary and scope, our total 
GHG emissions for FY22 increased 11% y-o-y by 36,100 
tCO2e, of which 92% (33,136 tCO2e) is attributed to the 
addition of a new source category. Another 
12,728 tCO2e was added to the inventory on account of 
electricity consumption from our co-located data centres.

HDFC Bank Limited Integrated Annual Report 2021-22

Our Scope 1 emission increased 
from 5,826 tCO2e in FY21 to 20,877 
tCO2e in FY22, primarily on account 
of inclusion of emissions from 
diesel consumption in generators – 
which were previously included in 
Scope 2. This is because we have 
actual/ perceived control on the fuel 
consumed at a significant number of 
our branches and office locations. 
Fuel consumption in company-owned 
vehicles account for about 41% of 
our Scope 1 emissions while diesel 
consumption in diesel generators 
account for the remaining 59%. 
Our Scope 2 emissions decreased by 
12,474 tCO2e in FY22 over FY21, of this 
9,570 tCO2e was on account of shifting 
emissions from diesel generators to 
Scope 1. Emissions on account of 
purchased electricity decreased by 
2,904 tCO2e, despite the inclusion 
of our co-located data centres and 
an increase in the number of other 
locations in Scope 2 inventory. 
We are committed to collaborating with 
our data centre service providers to 
reduce the GHG footprint of our owned 
and co-located data centres. Currently, 
data centres contribute 7% of our 
Scope 2 emissions. This year, we 
also enhanced our approach towards 
calculation of Scope 2 emissions. 
We have stepped up our efforts to 
collect actual electricity consumption 
data for estimating corresponding 
GHG emissions. In doing so, we 
are prioritising high-consumption 
locations. In FY22, we collected actual 
kWh data on electricity consumed 
from 46% of our locations – which 
collectively consumed about 50% of 
electrical energy. 
For remaining locations, we track the 
cost of electricity consumed through 
our robust financial management 
system and use the same to derive 
estimates of electricity consumed 
using the most conservative tariff 
for commercial slabs at the state 
level. There are some of our smaller 
locations like ATMs for which we 
are in the process of establishing 
systems to collect activity data. For 
such locations, we are estimating 
electrical energy consumption based 
on a methodology that takes into 
account the climatic zone in which 
such locations are based, and energy 
consumption benchmarks derived 
from data on actual electrical energy 
consumption collected by us in similar 
locations. Although electrical energy 
consumption at such ATMs is only 
about 4% of our total electrical energy 
consumption, we are progressively 
enhancing our systems to capture 
actual activity data on electrical energy 
consumption for all locations.
In FY22, our Scope 3 emissions 
increased significantly over FY21, 
primarily on account of inclusion 
of emissions due to electricity 
consumption at other facilities. 
These emissions now account for 
78% of our total Scope 3 emissions. 
The remaining 22% of our Scope 3 
emissions are split between emissions 
due to hired cabs (13%), air and rail 
travel (2%), paper waste (7%), and 
e-waste (<1%).
Environment
We have expanded the 
reporting boundary for 
our Scope 2 emissions. 
This year onwards, 
we will be including 
emissions relating to use 
of purchased electricity 
at our co-located data 
centres in our Scope 2 
emissions.

Notes:
Scope 1 emissions includes CO2, N2O and CH4 emissions from the combustion of diesel purchased 
by the Bank for its various facilities, as well as combustion of various fossil fuels in Bank-owned 
vehicles. For the former, diesel purchase data is extracted from the Bank’s financial management 
system and the cost of diesel purchased is converted into liters of diesel using conservative 
estimates of diesel prices in various states. For the latter source, activity data in terms of quantity 
of fuel has been extracted from the financial management system. Emission factors and GWP from 
GHG Protocol’s Cross sector tool and IPCC’s AR5 respectively have been used. 
Scope 2 emissions include GHG emissions from electricity consumed in the facilities that can be 
reasonably considered to be under the operational control of the Bank, as well as its co-located data 
centres. A hierarchical approach has been followed for estimation of emissions from this category 
(i.e. (i) monitored data on electrical energy consumption, (ii) estimates of electricity consumed based 
on procurement costs and state-level tariff; and (iii) estimated electricity consumption based on 
climatic-zone specific, internally derived electricity consumption benchmarks; in that order). In all 
cases, Grid emission factor from version 17 of the CEA’s (Central Electrical Authority) CO2 database 
has been used. 
Scope 3 emission estimation: Emission on account of purchased electricity at our other locations 
have been estimated using the same approach as in Scope 2 but includes other facilities not 
included in Scope 2 emissions. Emissions from hired cabs have been estimated based on expense 
report for hired cabs from the Bank’s financial management system – which has been used to derive 
the distance travelled. Average of emission factor for various categories of cars from the India GHG 
programme has been used. For domestic air and rail travel, information on trip characteristics has 
been extracted from the Bank’s financial management system, and the distance travelled is derived 
from publicly available sources. The emissions have been calculated in accordance with the India 
GHG programme. For international travel through air, the source of data remains the same, but 
emission factors for different class of travel and haul categories have been derived from the GHG 
protocol.
Emissions from paper and e-waste have been estimated based on emission factors provided by 
the latest version of the USEPA’s WARM tool on the extracted data for paper used and e-waste 
disposed.

We have been monitoring our energy 
performance by benchmarking it 
against the Bank’s income and 
full-time employees (FTEs). During 
FY22, our Scope 1+2 GHG emissions 
intensity decreased by 14% and 
6% y-o-y for per FTE and per Crore 
income, respectively. 
Key measures to reduce 
GHG emissions across our 
value chain
Reducing paper waste emissions: 
Our digital strategy forms the 
backbone of our paper waste 
reduction initiatives. Our digital 
products and services, along with 
automation of several internal as well 
as customer-linked processes and 
channels, have enabled us to reduce 
paper waste generation. The ‘Green 
Event Guidelines’ rolled out by our 
retail marketing team has helped save 
about 2.14 Million square feet of paper 
during the reporting year. We have 
also shifted to electronic payments for 
our electricity bill payments – which 
helps avoid paper use for issuing 
about 50,000 Demand Drafts annually. 
Where paper use is unavoidable, we 
are switching to recycled paper. As a 
result, associated emissions increased 
by less than 2% y-o-y in FY22, despite 
an 18.3% increase in our customer 
base. 
Tree plantation: We are also 
implementing an ambitious tree 
plantation programme, under which we 
have planted over 17 Lakh trees so far. 
This programme has not only positively 
impacted our GHG emissions, but has 
also helped enhance our social capital 
and relationship capital. 
Energy efficiency and 
energy management
over 80% of our GHG emissions are 
attributed to energy consumption 
in the form of electricity and diesel 
consumption in DG sets. We are 
aggressively working to reduce our 
energy consumption across operations 
to complement our initiatives to 
decarbonise. This is being achieved by 
reducing energy consumption across 
our operations by regulating existing 
equipment, installing energy-efficient 
ones, and implementing automated 
energy management solutions, among 
others. Our energy management and 
energy efficiency strategy includes 
various initiatives.
Energy efficient space cooling 
measures: We have installed 55 
Air Handling Units (AHUs) at our 
Kanjurmarg location and we are 
planning to replace all blowers to 
EC Fan by FY23, indicating potential 
savings of 25-40%. Thus far, we have 
converted one AHU as a trial and 
saved around 4,082 kWh of electrical 
energy while avoiding 4 MT of carbon 
emissions. We are installing inverter 
ACs in our locations that has helped 
us save 5 Million+ kWh of electricity 
during FY22. Additionally, we have also 
saved 54,450 kWh of electricity during 
the year, through installation of VRF 
HVAC Unit at our back offices. We use 
digital systems and data analytics to 
understand the energy consumption 
pattern, in addition to ensuring that the 
branches are maintained at optimal 
temperatures, improving the power 
factor and automating major energy 
consuming assets.
Efficient data centres: Our Bangalore 
data centre, ‘Netmagic-DC3B’ is a 
certified green data centre under 
the IGBC Green Data Center Rating 
System. We have implemented 
several other energy-saving measures 
including upgradation to efficient 
Environment
Our digitised processes 
and products have helped 
customers reduce their 
frequency of visits to the 
Bank’s branches, ATMs, and 
Offices - thereby reducing 
associated emissions.

FOR OUR DATA CENTRE IN BANGALORE
Building management and Green 
Buildings: We have incorporated 
several changes within our 
infrastructure to improve energy 
efficiency through auto controls and 
environment-friendly equipment. We 
have installed centrally controlled 
energy management system in 
600 branches across India till date. 
This system allows us to control 
consumption patterns, resulting in 
a minimum of 10% saving on power 
consumption. In FY22 alone, we 
saved ~48.81 Lakh units. Based on 
encouraging results from this project, 
we plan to expand the initiative to an 
additional 1,500 branches across 
the country. 
We have LEED Gold certified offices in 
Mumbai and Bhubaneswar. In addition, 
new buildings in Mohali, Kolkata Palava 
and Mumbai (Maharashtra) premises 
are being constructed to meet IGBC 
Gold certification standards. Similarly, 
our Wanowrie back-office has 
been designed as per IGBC Green 
standards; we have received IGBC 
Gold rating for it. All new interior work 
carried out during and after FY22 are 
being designed as per IGBC Green 
standards. So far, interior work at 
378 branches is being carried out as 
per IGBC Green standards and one 
branch in Maharashtra has received 
Gold rating.
Besides, we are leveraging technology 
and innovation as facilitators in our 
journey towards low-carbon growth. 
We have implemented elevator and 
equipment scheduling to reduce our 
energy consumption. We have also 
installed occupancy sensors, capacitor 
banks as well as Building Management 
Systems at several of our operating 
locations. The energy management 
modules with auto controls deployed 
across select branches have resulted 
in significant energy savings.

Renewable energy
With the goal of gradually 
decarbonising our energy 
consumption, we are steadily 
increasing the share of renewable 
energy in our overall power 
consumption. We have installed 
rooftop solar plants at our offices in 
Jaipur, Pune, Noida, Bhubaneswar, 
Chandigarh, Mumbai and Mohali.
In Maharashra, we are gradually 
shifting our branches to run on green 
power procured through DISCOMs at 
a premium. So far, 14 of our branches 
are operating on green power, resulting 
in annual avoidance of ~905 MT 
carbon emissions on 1,028 MWh of 
procurement per annum.

GENERATION CAPACITY COMMISSIONED 
AS OF MARCH 31, 2022
Managing waste
We are working progressively towards 
sustainable management of waste 
generated from our operations. We 
deal with three types of non-hazardous 
waste – e-waste, dry waste (paper 
waste) and wet waste (cafeteria, 
sewage), of which e-waste is disposed 
through authorised recyclers. A total of 
212 tonnes of e-waste was generated 
in FY22, because of asset refresh, 
damaged and non-functional assets. 
For paper waste and wet waste, we 
are developing a management plan 
in consultation with our partners. We 
have already initiated pilots at select 
locations and intend to scale it up 
over the next few years. We continue 
to work towards establishing and 
implementing systems and procedures 
for tracking wet and dry waste from 
our operations.
Environment
We are also aggressively working 
towards minimising the use of plastic 
bottles. Single use plastic bottles 
have already been phased out from 
all our hub offices pan-India, and we 
have replaced multiple use plastic 
water bottles with glass jars across 
all meeting and video conferencing 
rooms. Hazardous waste within our 
scope, arising from diesel/fuel oil used 
in generator sets, is negligible.
Responsible financing 
ESG and climate change are 
becoming increasingly important from 
the perspective of borrower credit 
evaluation, as well as regulators and 
other stakeholders. We are following 
a two-pronged approach to address 
ESG and climate change risks in 
our lending portfolio. On one hand, 
we seek to ensure adoption of and 
adherence to complete ESG and 
Climate Change assessment across 
multiple business divisions when 
issuing credit facilities, based on 
interactions with stakeholders, external 
agencies and relevant literature. On 
the other hand, we are engaging 
with some of our largest corporate 
borrowers to better understand their 
ESG strategies and transition plans for 
managing climate risks. 
Our credit policy requires that no 
funding be provided for establishing 
new manufacturing units that 
produce or consume ozone-depleting 
substances, and that no financing 
be provided to small- and mediumsized businesses that manufacture 
aerosols containing CFCs. Besides, 
as a standard practice, we require all 
loans, including project loans, to be 
approved by a Credit Approver/Senior 
Credit Approver with the necessary 
approval authority. Due to the elevated 
risk involved with large project loans, 
the extension of financing for such 
projects require additional approvals 
from senior management/the Board 
to ensure adequate scrutiny of the 
proposals. 
Evaluation of environmental and social 
risk is an integral part of our overall 
credit appraisal and approval process. 

In FY22, 861 loan 
proposals were 
screened through the 
SEMS framework
Long-term financing proposals for 
large industrial/infrastructure projects 
(greater than `100 Million and tenor 
above 5 years) are evaluated through 
the SEMS framework, which requires 
an assessment of Environmental, 
Health, Social, and Safety risks in 
addition to other risks as part of 
the overall credit appraisal process. 
This comprehensive assessment 
involves evaluating the borrower's 
operations, as well as any potential 
negative environmental and social 
consequences. We have already 
mapped potential impact categories 
for risk evaluation of specific, capitalintensive industries such as roads 
and highways, thermal power, power 
transmission, cement, hydroelectric 
power, and manufacturing, among 
others, to guide the assessment 
process. In addition, the SEMS 
framework includes assessment of 
aspects related to labour availability 
and worker welfare, risk assessments, 
and compliances and approvals. 
In FY22, 861 loan proposals were 
screened through the SEMS 
framework.

Environment
Where required, we place predisbursement stipulations/terms 
of sanction to mitigate adverse 
environmental and social impacts, 
collect undertaking of compliance with 
applicable regulations and criteria, and 
monitor ongoing compliance on an 
annual basis.
Our lending procedures are guided 
by borrower and market demand, but 
our credit exposure is well-diversified, 
with no single industry having a 
high concentration. As a result, our 
credit exposure to ecologically/
socially sensitive industry sectors has 
minimal negative consequences. We 
also finance entities that deals with 
environmental and social issues. 
For select large project finance transactions, we 
appoint a Lenders' Independent Engineer (LIE) for 
conducting an environmental and techno-commercial 
evaluation of the project prior to loan disbursement. 
Any loan disbursement is subject to the correction of 
deficiencies related to environmental and social risks 
identified by LIE. During the construction stage as well, 
the LIE continues to monitor the project and flags any 
risks associated with environmental/social issues in 
the project to the Bank and borrower for necessary 
corrective action.
We have identified upgradation of 
the SEMS framework as a priority 
activity and have been working 
on revising the SEMS framework 
with a ‘ESG & Climate Change 
Assessment’ framework to enable a 
more comprehensive assessment of 
ESG and Climate Change issues. We 
have also been working on expanding 
the coverage of the assessment 
framework. Our newly formulated and 
exhaustive ‘ESG & Climate Change 
Template’ shall be applicable to all 
Credit Assessment Memoranda 
Upgrading to a new ‘ESG & Climate Change Assessment’ framework 
(CAMs) where the aggregate CAM 
appetite crosses a certain threshold, 
rather than at a transactional level, as 
is the current practice. This template 
shall be included in all CAMs where 
direct customer exposure is above a 
certain threshold. 
Highlights of 
the Bank’s 
credit exposure 
Less than 1% of the total exposure comes from fossil fuels (coal and lignite) 
and their extraction/mining 
No exposure of chemical or biological weapons manufacturing enterprises; 
the Bank provides a substantial amount of funding to the healthcare industry 
to meet the funding requirements of hospitals, diagnostic labs, and clinics 
Solar and wind power, hydroelectricity, natural gas (extraction and 
distribution), and biogas-based energy generation are a mong the Bank’s 
environment-friendly industry sectors for lending 
Financing to regional rural banks, NBFC and microfinance that are key financial 
intermediaries to agriculture workers, self-help groups, MSMEs, etc. through 
direct lending (term loans, working capital loans, etc.) and/or through purchase 
of receivables through the securitisation/direct assignment/IBPC route 

To complement our ESG and Climate 
Change risk assessment framework, 
we are tailoring our own corporate 
loan portfolio towards climatesensitive financing and to companies 
with robust systems and processes. 
For this purpose, we have begun 
engaging with select customers to 
understand their current ESG strategy, 
compliance, reporting frameworks 
and ESG ratings; their operations, and 
long-term climate transition plans for 
carbon footprint reduction through 
process improvements in existing 
operations, business transitions, such 
as de-commissioning of certain lines 
of business and investment in 'clean' 
technologies; and targets for water 
consumption reduction, emission 
reduction, etc.
The Product Responsibility subcommittee of our ESG action 
committee focuses on identifying new 
opportunities in the Environmental and 
Social space, such as Green Bonds. 
We aim to provide access to capital for 
environmentally sustainable projects 
that contribute to climate change 
mitigation. 
We also finance renewable energy 
projects. So far, we have underwritten 
loans of H14,839 Crore for a cumulative 
capacity of 5,860 MW (solar capacity 
of 3,386 MW and wind of 584 MW). 
We have also financed city-gas 
distribution networks under Minimum 
Work Program with a total underwritten 
amount of H2,393 Crore for 794 CNG 
stations and over 4.6 Million domestic 
connections. In FY22, we also 
partnered with Indore Clean Energy 
Private Limited for financing Asia’s 
largest waste to energy plant at Indore, 
Madhya Pradesh. This plant aims 
to treat 50% of municipal waste 
generated in the city and convert it 
to 100% biogas and manure.

Achieve carbon neutrality by 2032
Environment
In June 2021, the Bank pledged to become carbon neutral 
by FY32. We are in the process of rolling out an integrated 
actionable strategy roadmap comprising three mitigation 
pillars and three management pillars. The next decade 
will be a ‘Decade of Action’ for the Bank, as we will build 
on each of these pillars to make meaningful and systemdriven changes within the organisation to achieve our 
carbon neutrality goal.

Our target includes GHG emissions 
generated by our operations arising 
from the combustion of fossil fuels 
(Scope 1 emissions) as well as 
emissions from the generation of 
purchased electricity consumed by 
the Bank (Scope 2 emissions) at its 
operating locations and its owned 
and co-located data centres. The 
target covers carbon dioxide (CO2), 
nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane 
(CH4) emissions.
Our integrated strategy for achieving 
carbon neutrality is based on a 
detailed assessment of our key 
operational parameters. The baseline 
emissions were established based on 
the latest dataset available, which fed 
into an integrated tool for forecasting 
emissions. The projected emissions 
based on a likely business growth 
scenario were laid over with multiple 
scenarios of emission reduction 
pathways to understand cost and 
potential reductions under each 
scenario. Based on an engaging and 
deeply consultative process with our 
departmental teams and ESG action 
committees, we have set our eyes to 
achieve carbon neutrality based on 
the following interventions:
Demand-side energy 
management
We are in the process of adopting 
a broad range of technological 
solutions and operational measures 
to reduce energy consumption at our 
operating locations. We have mapped 
Energy Performance Indicator (EPI) 
for all our locations and are using 
it as an internal benchmark for the 
energy performance of all types of 
facilities. We have shortlisted various 
demand-side interventions for 
phase-wise implementation across 
locations based on an assessment of 
feasibility and RoI. These measures 
include smart IoT-based building 
management systems, modular 
UPS systems, air-conditioners with 
high ISEER rating using Brushless DC 
Motors (BLDC) technology, etc.
Supply-side energy 
interventions
We seek to progressively decarbonise 
our energy consumption and 
are increasingly adopting lowcarbon energy sources to support 
our operations. Our supply-side 
strategy focuses on gradual shifting 
to green tariffs offered by utilities 
wherever available and procurement 
of renewable energy from offsite 
power plants and exchanges. The 
green tariff option, which is currently 
available only in a few states 
(Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra 
Pradesh) is expected to be made 
available and affordable in more 
states, and therefore in the interest 
of sustainability, we plan to make use 
of the offering on a gradual basis, 
despite a premium over the existing 
electricity rates. In large locations 
where regulatory requirements for 
open access and wheeling are met, 
renewable energy will be procured 
from offsite power plants, either 
directly or through power exchanges. 
The initial list of locations where 
renewable energy procurement is 
planned to be taken up is already 
identified. A firm-level policy guideline 
on making maximum use of green 
energy supply interventions in existing 
and new locations is also being 
finalised. If and when required, we may 
also utilise green certificates for carbon 
neutrality compliance.
Carbon Credits and 
Offsets
Carbon offsets will continue to play 
a role in addressing the balance 
of our residual emissions. We will 
evaluate and leverage carbon 
offsets and assess opportunities to 
develop mitigation and abatement 
projects through technological and 
nature-based solutions. We intend 
to engage in voluntary markets, and 
in compliance markets when the 
latter is applicable to our business 
operations. When participating in 
voluntary carbon markets, we will 
carry out due diligence to ensure that 
we retire the highest quality offsets, 
which are verified by internationally 
recognised standards such as Verra, 
Gold Standard, etc., to balance our 
residual emissions. We will adopt a 
two-pronged approach to secure the 
availability of offsets for retirement. 
While we may make direct investments 
in carbon offset generating projects 
in collaboration with our partners, we 
may also need to purchase carbon 
credits from various market options on 
a need basis for retirement against our 
residual emissions. While investing in 
carbon offset generating projects, we 
will prioritise projects that add socioeconomic-ecological value to the 
communities in which we operate, and 
those projects which are in proximity to 
our operations in India. 
The ‘management’ related pillars of 
our carbon neutrality strategy pertain 
to developing firm-level guidelines 
for operations and procurement 
for supply-side and demand-side 
interventions, establishing a framework 
for coordinated action between 
key teams for implementation and 
continuously enhancing the GHG 
data collection processes to improve 
the quality of the inventory. We will 
also monitor the implementation of 
interventions and progress towards 
our emission reduction targets every 
two years and realign our integrated 
strategy incorporating the best 
available technologies and measures.

Environment

TCFD disclosures
HDFC Bank recognises the growing concerns of regulators, investors and clients 
about climate risks that businesses, particularly banks and financial institutions, 
face. This is our second year of working on the recommendations of the Task 
Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) – which provides a useful 
framework for identifying climate-related risks and opportunities, evaluating 
effective responses and communicating crucial information to stakeholders. 
Governance
We have a strong Risk Management Group (RMG) at the 
Bank that oversees putting the Board's risk strategy into 
action, as well as designing procedures and systems for 
detecting, measuring, monitoring, assessing and managing 
risks. The RMG is led by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), who 
is responsible for risk management and the entire risk 
architecture and framework of the Bank including stress 
testing. The Chief Information Security Officer reports on 
the Bank's cyber-security concerns as well as updates from 
Business Impact Analysis and Disaster Response. 
The Group Head for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 
& ESG updates the CSR & ESG committee of the Board, 
every quarter on the Bank's sustainability (ESG) initiatives 
and progress on ESG actionables and chairs the ESG apex 
committee. The ESG apex committee governs and reviews 
the progress of the three action committees that drive the 
ESG agenda (including climate change) at the Bank. 
The Product Responsibility sub-committee, examines 
Environmental & Social (E&S) risks in our operations, 
including climate risks, while finding new business 
opportunities in the E&S arena. The Environment subcommittee comprises of representatives from the 
Administration, Infrastructure and IT teams at the Bank, sets 
targets and identifies opportunities for improvement in areas

Risk Management
Current 
regulation 
Banks are highly regulated in the country and mandates as part 
of current regulations are always integrated into the overall risk 
planning and assessment process. Current regulations are also 
factored in the credit assessment process, especially through 
the SEMS framework which is used to screen large loans for 
environmental and social risks. 
Emerging 
regulation 
Transition risk can impact the Bank's credit portfolio resulting from 
changes in the climate policy, technology, consumer, and market 
sentiment during the transition to a low-carbon economy. This is 
particularly relevant for policy changes that can result in loan defaults 
from certain sectors like coal, thermal and infrastructure. We are 
exploring techniques for developing climate risk assessment and 
scenario analysis to analyse our portfolio at risk due to the transition 
risk of climate change.
Technology 
While our digital environment and information security standards 
are the foundation of our business today, as financial services 
professionals, we do not anticipate technology to have a significant 
impact on climate risk. Our low-carbon digital banking products use 
technology to enable business.
Legal 
For large loans, we verify whether the project complies with all 
applicable environmental rules, failing to do so could result in the 
loan becoming a non-performing asset if the project goes into 
litigation. This, however, is not a claim against the Bank. There are 
no other circumstances in which the Bank can be held liable for a 
climate-related lawsuit.
Market 
In the context of climate change, markets could play a key role 
in shifting the demand and supply for certain products like green 
loans or bonds, or in low-carbon digital products. However, we do 
recognise the relevance of change in consumer preferences, and 
hence, the need to evaluate this risk, but do not have the tools 
at present to quantify/include this as part of our risk assessment 
process. 
Reputation
Reputation risk from community/customer perception is a primary 
risk to our business. We thus invest in community and customer 
involvement through surveys to educate and enlighten them 
on our environmental sustainability programmes. Further, ESG 
performance measures are increasingly being used by the global 
investor community, especially sovereign wealth funds and pension 
funds, to assess long-term profitable growth. We strive to implement 
environment-friendly measures throughout our operations. We 
further show our commitment to ESG, particularly climate change, 
by including ESG elements in regulatory reporting such as the 
annual report. In addition, in our annual integrated report, we publish 
details on our carbon emissions and footprint (third-party assured). 
Strategy
The Bank has been reporting to the 
Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) 
on its climate change strategy, 
risks, opportunities, and emissions. 
From the perspective of climate risk 
assessment, we will assess the priority 
of physical and transition risks in the 
near to medium term. Some of the 
critical parameters to consider would 
be GHG emissions, air pollutants and 
climate transition risk pathways both at 
the sector and borrower level. 
There are two main types of climaterelated risks: 
Physical risks (both acute 
and chronic): Economic losses 
(physical damage to property and 
assets) from extreme weather 
events (flood, cyclone, etc) 
attributed to climate change; and 
2) Transition risks: Possible 
process of adjustment to a lowcarbon economy and its effects 
on the value of financial assets 
and liabilities
We are exploring frameworks to model 
and assess climate risks. We also 
continue to acquire granular data 
further corroborated by BRSR data 
(FY23 onwards) and test tools for 
climate risk assessment and conduct 
scenario analysis through suitable 
partnerships – including exploring 
options to tie-up with data providers. 
Given that climate risk is an emerging 
and long-term risk for the Bank, we 
will consider adopting a suitable 
methodology/pathway to analyse the 
Bank's exposures under different 
climate scenarios. 
Environment

Evaluation of environmental & social 
risk is an integral part of our overall 
credit appraisal and approval process. 
Large industrial / infrastructure 
projects where the extension of 
long-term financing (greater than 
`100 million and longer than 5 
years) are covered under the Bank’s 
Social & Environment Monitoring 
System (SEMS) which necessitates 
an assessment of Environmental, 
Health, Social, and Safety risks in 
addition to other risks as part of the 
overall credit appraisal process. This 
comprehensive assessment involves 
evaluation of various environmental 
and social aspects of the project and 
operations of the borrowing entity - 
such as the nature of the borrower's 
operations, as well as any potential 
negative environmental and social 
consequences. We have already 
mapped potential impact categories 
for risk evaluation of specific, capitalintensive industries such as Roads 
and Highways, Thermal Power, Power 
Transmission, Cement, Hydroelectric 
Power, and Manufacturing amongst 
others to guide the assessment 
process. While the bank's lending 
procedures are guided by borrower 
and market demands, the bank's credit 
exposure is well diversified across 
numerous industries, with no single 
industry having a high concentration. 
As a result, the Bank's credit exposure 
to ecologically / socially sensitive 
industry sectors has minimal negative 
consequences. In addition, as part 
of our credit policy, we do not extend 
finance for setting up of new units for 
producing/consuming ozone-depleting 
substances (CFC -11, CFC – 12, CFC 
– 113, Carbon Tetrachloride, Methyl 
Chloroform, Halons – 1211, 1301, 2402) 
and for small & medium scale units 
engaged in the manufacture of aerosol 
units using CFC. 
We recognise the importance of water 
availability affecting our portfolio, 
especially in certain sectors like 
agriculture. As part of our credit due 
diligence, we evaluate loan proposals 
against water availability with an 
assured irrigation facility. In case of 
climate-linked events like droughts, 
we extend crop insurance facility to 
borrowers (who harvest at least two 
cropping cycles).
Metrics and Targets
We are firming up an integrated 
strategy to achieve carbon neutrality 
by 2032, which will set internal 
benchmarks for energy performance 
and targets for phased renewable 
energy integration. We will monitor 
the implementation of interventions 
and emission reduction achievements 
every two years and realign our 
integrated strategy incorporating 
the best available technologies and 
practices. 
We plan to enhance our commitment 
to financing climate change solutions 
such as energy transition, renewables, 
energy efficiency, sustainable 
transportation, green buildings, 
climate smart agriculture, among 
others, besides monitoring the 
implications of our own operations. 
We are working on developing KPIs 
and setting goals to monitor, manage, 
and track the progress. This involves 
a thorough examination of our Scope 
3 emissions and our carbon-related 
asset exposure. Please refer to the 
Environment section of this Report 
for details on our performance on 
emissions and energy-related KPIs.
Acute 
physical 
Acute physical hazards can have a negative influence on our 
credit portfolio by causing bad debts due to damage to property, 
infrastructure, and land. This is also relevant for climate disasters 
destroying assets (that serve as collaterals). We continue to 
measure physical risks from a climate risk assessment perspective 
and will assess the priority of these risks in the near-to-medium 
term. In addition, our Disaster Response and Business Continuity 
teams conduct business impact analyses and have rapid response 
procedures in place in the event of natural disasters such as floods.
Chronic 
physical 
Chronic physical risks are far into the future. Given that climate risk 
is an emerging and long-term risk us, we will consider adopting 
a suitable methodology/pathway to analyse our exposures under 
different climate scenarios.

Customer Centricity
Creating value for our customers
Customer Focus is one of the five core 
values of the Bank. Our customer base 
consists of individuals, corporates, 
MSMEs, farmers and Government 
entities amongst others and our focus is 
to provide them with a seamless banking 
experience. We undertake multiple 
initiatives geared towards serving the 
diverse needs of the customers and our 
efforts are reflected in the strength of 
our brand value and recall.
Service Quality 
Initiatives and 
Grievance Redressal
Driven by the core value of Customer 
Focus, the Bank has always 
endeavoured to improve customer 
experience and has adopted a 
holistic approach for the same 
across multiple channels ranging 
from BranchBanking, PhoneBanking, 
NetBanking, MobilBanking, EVA 
chatbot and the Bank’s social care 
handles. The Bank has also improvised 
on the relationship-based banking 
programmes. In addition to the 
branch-based relationship managers, 
it also has a Virtual Relationship 
Manager (VRM) programme to 
cater to various financial needs in a 
personalized manner. The Bank has 
adopted a three-step strategy with 
regards to Customer Service– Define, 
Measure, and Improve. It invites and 
reviews performance on customer 
service as well as grievance redressal 
at different levels which are Branch 
Level Customer Service Committees 
(BLCSCs), Standing Committee 
on Customer Service (SCCS) and 
Customer Service Committee of the 
Board (CSCB). We have put robust 
processes in place to regularly monitor 
and measure quality of service levels 
not only at various touch points but 
also at a product and process level by 
Quality Initiatives Group.
As part of its continuous efforts to 
enhance quality of service, the Service 
Quality team carries out regular 
reviews across various products/
processes/channels. The effectiveness 
of the quality of service provided 
is also reviewed at different levels, 
including the Customer Service 
Committee of the Board.
One of the basic building blocks of 
providing acceptable level of customer 
service is to have an effective internal 
Grievance Redressal mechanism / 
framework. In this regard, we have 
outlined a framework for redressal of 
customer grievances and documented 
it in the form of a Grievance Redressal 
Policy – duly approved by its Board. 
It has also made this policy available 
in public domain (on the website 
as well as in the branches). The 
Bank has also formulated a Board 
approved Protection Policy, which 
limits the liability of customers in case 
of unauthorized electronic banking 
transactions.
Thanks to these initiatives, the Bank’s 
customer complaints for FY22 
decreased by 21% from 4,67,453* to 
3,68,291.
*Restated complaints number based on re classification of queries into complaints from 3,25,786.

Building a customercentric culture using Net 
Promoter System (NPS) 
- ‘Infinite Smiles’
We, at the Bank, believe that delivering 
an outstanding customer experience 
is a strong differentiator for a great 
product and is key to a sustained 
competitive advantage. The primary 
aim of the Infinite Smiles programme is 
to establish employee behaviour and 
practices which leads to customercentric actions and continuous 
improvements. 
Last year, we initiated measurement 
on key journeys, identified action areas 
to improve customer experience and 
implemented several key initiatives. 
This has led to a steady improvement 
on our NPS over the year. This year, 
we built on our commitment to our 
customers by scaling the coverage 
of our Infinite Smiles program – we 
introduced new journeys, new 
episodes and new products ensuring a 
much wider coverage. Customer focus 
has seen an increased focus - regular 
cadence with key stakeholders and 
rigorous follow-up on actions have 
become the cornerstones of 
Infinite Smiles.
The programme now encompasses 
critical episodes – Digital Journey 
Episodes, Credit Card Episodes, 
Customer Instructions, Tele 
Interactions and Collection Process. 
We now cover 120+ episodes and 
have contacted around 63 Million 
customers in FY22 for their feedback.
Our ‘Infinite Smiles’ program rests 
on three meticulously designed 
pillars – 'Listen', 'Learn' and 'Act' 
which enables us to embed customer 
feedback led transformation as a 
discipline into our systems, challenge 
what is considered as the standard, 
and offer a customer experience 
that places us amongst the best 
service brands.

Guided by our aspiration to move 
from score to systems, we have been 
working to institutionalize the process 
for addressing customer issues that 
transcend beyond measurement and 
create a culture of customer-centricity 
and agility. 
We would not only like to anticipate 
and react to changing customer 
expectations but also like to provide 
a proposition to our customer that 
makes us more attractive than 
competitive alternatives. 
With this in view we subscribed to 
competitive benchmarking of NPS, in 
form of a subscription based product 
NPS Prism®.
HDFC Bank leads the overall brand 
NPS ranking among 20+ competitors 
in the banking category. 
Our commitment to building a 
customer obsessed culture and 
constant effort to include everyone 
in the organisation has ensured 
continuous improvement leading to 
growth in customer advocacy of the 
brand. 
Customer Centricity
Some of our customer-centric initiatives
On Doctors Day - 2021, we presented 
Salaam Dil Sey – a platform for our 
customers to thank doctors and their 
families for their hard work, sacrifice 
and tireless service. As they bravely 
continue to fight the pandemic, we 
tried to put a smile on their faces. 
Customers dedicated a “Salaam 
Dil Sey” (a personalized greeting 
card) to over 1 lac doctors and their 
families. HDFC Bank put all these 
greeting cards in a collage, displayed 
on ‘Wall of dedication’ at its Sandoz 
Bank House and unveiled on 1st July 
2021 virtually by Dr Naresh Trehan 
in presence of prominent media and 
Bank’s Sr. officials. This attempt was 
also recorded in Asia Book of Records 
& India Book of Records for “Largest 
Collage of Thank you messages”. 
The Bank also gave musical tribute to 
the doctor's fraternity by a specially 
curated anthem on the Salaam Dil 
Sey theme. HDFC Bank reached out 
to 23Mn+ people through print, social 
media and email/SMS. Our branch 
staff personally met and greeted 
40,000+ doctors during this campaign.

After the tremendous success of our 
Mooh Band Rakho campaign in 2020, 
we launched the second edition in 
support of the International Fraud 
Awareness Week in November 2021. 
Aimed at increasing awareness on all 
types of financial fraud, the campaign 
underlined the importance of not 
disclosing information, especially 
banking details, and to safeguard 
oneself from digital frauds. 
We launched a series of videos using 
relatable real-life situations to educate 
customers on various types of modus 
operandi. We conducted over 2,000 
workshops over 4 months across 
the country, advocating simple steps 
such as not clicking on unknown links, 
sharing card details, CVV, Expiry Date, 
OTP NetBanking/ MobileBanking Login 
ID & Password over Phone, SMS, 
email and social media. It focused on 
the younger segment targeting Senior 
Secondary Schools & Colleges to 
make safe banking an early habit in 
their financial journey.

Digitisation 
Digital Future-ready Bank 
HDFC Bank has always been 
at the forefront of innovation 
in the Indian financial 
services industry. Under our 
technology transformation 
agenda, we are investing to 
‘Run the Bank’ as well as 
‘Build a Future-ready Bank’. 
We are also strengthening 
our digital backbone to create 
differentiated, secure offerings 
for the tech-savvy customer 
backed by a core technology 
that is always ‘ON’. 
Key initiatives undertaken
Infrastructure scalability
We have invested in a hybrid-cloud 
approach with leading cloud service 
partners such as AWS, Azure and 
GCP. A common landing zone has 
been implemented across these 
partners to create a secure and 
streamlined environment for all cloud 
deployments. We have moved our 
primary data centers to state-of-theart facilities in Mumbai and Bengaluru 
to ensure a robust IT infrastructure to 
back our digital offerings and ensure 
higher uptimes across customer 
touchpoints. 
Capacity upgrades
Capacity management practices 
have been significantly strengthened 
to ensure close monitoring of peak 
volumes across key performance 
parameters. We have established a 
Technology Obsolescence Program 
Management Office to track, manage 
and replace/upgrade obsolete 
components in a timely manner.
Disaster recovery resilience
We are moving to the next level 
of Disaster Recovery (DR) with 
automation and implementation of 
‘Hot DR’/Active – active setup for key 
applications. 
Minimised surface area for 
cyber-attacks
We have made significant 
advancements to further consolidate 
cyber security through initiatives 
such as the foundation of a next-gen 
Security Operations Center (SOC) 
for predictive security and incident 
management, introduction of SOAR 
(Security Orchestration, Automation & 
Response) to reduce incident response 
times, network micro-segmentation 
for better control, visibility and 
preparedness against ransomware, 
and round-the-clock defacement 
monitoring and vulnerability 
management of our internet properties.
Underpinning our technology 
transformation agenda is our vision

Embarking on cultural 
transformation
At HDFC Bank, our culture and people 
are key enablers to continue creating 
value for our stakeholders. We have 
embarked on a conscious Culture 
Transformation journey i.e. “The HDFC 
Bank Way”. It is a key element of the 
3Cs: Culture, Conscience and Customers 
that empower our business. The HDFC 
Bank Way is defined by the six pillars of 
Culture – Integrity, Execution, Innovation, 
Humility, Inclusion and Collaboration. 
With the DNA of a responsible banker, we 
are aligning our businesses objectives 
with the 3Cs of culture, conscience and 
customers. 
Human Capital
Further, we brought in a paradigm shift in our approach 
towards learning and development through the 
establishment of the Learning Partner model. We moved 
ahead on our Diversity and Inclusion agenda with specific 
focus on women and persons with disabilities. Our flagship 
initiative, ‘HDFC Bank Cares’ is designed to enable people 
to take charge of their own wellbeing thereby creating 
an emotionally committed workforce. We are leveraging 
technology in the entire employee journey from talent 
onboarding, virtual learning, wellness initiatives, diversity 
and inclusion programmes to employee performance 
management.

Our Culture
A connected workforce that has 
a deep sense of belonging to the 
organization is imperative to providing 
a differentiated customer experience. 
Our onward journey and continued 
success will come from reinforcing 
our culture ‘The HDFC Bank Way’. 
It is defined by six pillars - Integrity 
|Collaboration | Inclusion |Humility | 
Innovation | Execution 
With a focus to reinforce the HDFC 
Bank Way, a large-scale Culture 
Transformation was conceived and 
deployed across the entire Bank 
through the ’Nurture, Care and 
Collaborate (‘NCC’) intervention. 
A Culture Transformation journey 
spans several years to get ingrained 
as the organizational ethos and as 
a first step towards this, the NCC 
initiative this year focused on our 
12000+ managers as ‘Custodians of 
Culture’. The objective of the program 
was to percolate the essence of the 
HDFC Bank Way by focusing on nine 
key themes over a five-month journey 
delivered through versatile and exciting 
challenges and learning tools. The 
scale was massive: 99,877 learning 
content hours were delivered in 145 
days and an average of 700 hours 
of content consumed daily. We are 
proud that 97% participants gave NCC 
a thumbs-up for its unique design & 
content.

Diversity and Inclusion (D&I)
Inclusion is one of the key culture 
pillars of The HDFC Bank Way. 
We promote a work culture where 
everyone feels included, respected 
and valued, and has access 
to equal opportunity. We have 
branded our inclusion agenda as 
‘Valuing Differences’. We provide 
equal and fair remuneration 
opportunities, irrespective of 
gender. No complaints related to 
incidents of discrimination reported 
during FY22.

Our D&I agenda focuses on two critical 
segments:
 · Gender diversity 
 · Persons with Disabilities (PwD)
Women at our 
Workplace
We work relentlessly to support the 
women at our workplace and provide 
them with an ecosystem that nurture 
their careers while being mindful of 
their unique challenges. Today, 21.7% 
of our workforce consists of women 
and we have set a target to increase 
this to 25% by 2025. 
‘Family reasons’ was revealed as a 
top driver for women attrition in our 
attrition studies. We also understood 
that returning mothers were finding it 
difficult to balance work and personal 
responsibilities. To this effect, we have 
undertaken focused interventions and 
designed programmes that address 
these challenges. 
Bank Again Program: This 
programme enables women to re-start 
their careers after a break. We reached 
out to over 3,000 women employees 
who had left from the bank over the 
past 5 years, out of which over 300 
former colleagues have re-joined the 
Bank. We are also closely monitoring 
our gender hiring with 28% of those 
hired in the year being women. This 
excludes front-line sales hiring. 
‘Pleasant Parenthood Program: 
Under this programme, we have a suite 
of offerings and initiatives to support 
women along their critical milestones 
– pre, during and post maternity leave. 
This programme also enables flexibility 
with respect to work timings, location 
and provides part-time working 
options. All our full-time employees 
are entitled to avail parental leave. In 
FY 22, 1182 female and 3072 male 
employees availed parental leave of 
which 99.75% female (1179) and 100% 
male (3071) returned to work. 6.6% 
women (78) and 5% men (160) who 
returned to work after leave ended, 
were still employed with us after 12 
months.

The Career Accelerator Programme: Our flagship intervention is aimed at building and augmenting the women talent 
pipeline for senior roles. It incorporates unique learning elements like sponsorship, group coaching, virtual learning journey, 
leadership connect and employee resource groups. 
She Inspires: This year we also ran a campaign called ‘She Inspires’ celebrating women leaders at the Bank. A video 
series was created to disseminate, powerful messages of encouragement and leadership journeys by colleagues across 
the organisation.

A different perspective — 
Persons with Disabilities at our 
workplace
We are focused on building a 
workplace wherein every individual has 
an opportunity to do meaningful work, 
irrespective of any disabilities. 
We are taking small but steady steps in 
this direction:
 · Sensitising our people to create an 
environment of inclusion for Persons 
with Disabilities (PwD). Initiated by our 
Board of Directors and Group Heads 
in May 2021, sensitisation workshops 
that dealt with unconscious biases 
were organised for 6,900+ managers 
across the organisation. 
 · The inclusion governance teams work 
in tandem with HR to codify roles for 
integrating PwD seamlessly within the 
organisation. Teams are consciously 
working to improve the infrastructure 
requirements for fair and free access 
and identifying specific barriers for 
inclusion of PwDs.
We are in the process of augmenting 
our internal systems for better 
interconnection for persons with 
disabilities. Currently, we have about 
115 persons with disabilities employed 
with us and have additional hires in the 
pipeline. Furthermore, a programme 
for enabling the certification of team 
leaders on building and managing 
inclusive teams is being initiated in 
FY23.
Learning and Development
Learning initiatives 
In FY22, we brought in a paradigm 
shift in our approach to learning 
and development through the 
establishment of the Learning Partner 
model. This model institutionalises 
performance consulting, which 
consists of identifying a business need, 
its cause(s) and the capability building 
strategy (if applicable) that can meet 
that need. Performance consultants 
are experts in understanding business 
and improving human performance, 
and specialise in enhancing 
employees' performance through a 
collaborative approach.
The intent is to align business 
priorities with learning goals. Further, 
we strengthened our offerings 
on Leadership and Professional 
Development journeys. 
‘Ignite’, a programme aimed at middle 
management levels, focuses on 
collaborative and strategic skills and 
encourages courageous leadership. 
‘Trailblaze’ delivers key competencies 
and management essentials for 
frontline managers to enhance their 
effectiveness. 
Building on the foundation laid last 
year, we are progressing towards 
creating a Virtual University and 
Learning Experience platform (LXP). 
Targeting the next generation of 
employees, LXP facilitates self-paced, 
learner-led modules on the go in a 
virtual setting.

HR Tech
This year saw the Bank’s HR tech 
transformation journey took a decisive 
turn, with most of the HR services 
made available on mobile. The 
interventions were designed to amplify 
a ‘DIY’ approach through new-age 
interfaces, in line with the digital 
vision of the Bank. ‘I-Cube’, an HR 
conversational bot, was introduced 
to enable self-service and easy 
resolution of queries, not just for active 
employees but also for our former 
employees. Time Management piece 
was brought on mobile devices for 
all HDFC banks working in offshore 
locations. Many changes related to 
process governance, reporting, user 
friendliness were incorporated in 
the areas of hiring, employee onboarding and learning. Other hygiene 
HR services were also brought on 
the device and network environment 
agnostic HCM solution.
Talent management
We have a structured, welldocumented Leadership Competency 
Framework. as well as a Functional 
Capability Framework which defines 
key competencies and forms the 
bedrock for various talent processes in 
the Bank. 
We have also institutionalised the 
process of Talent Review Councils, 
wherein a panel of leaders take an indepth understanding of the Talent from 
multiple data points – self view from 
employee (mobility, career aspiration 
etc.), performance track record, Line 
Manager’s feedback on the talent 
and inputs of potential from the 
Development Center Report. This as 
a process, is covered for CX & 3 levels 
down of their leadership hierarchy.
The year also saw the launch of a 
360-degree feedback at apex levels of 
leadership. The intervention covering 
Group Heads, Business Heads and 
senior leaders reporting to the Group 
Heads was launched with credible 
external partners and facilitated the 
gathering of honest feedback by those 
who experience the leaders at work 
every day. This helped creating better 
self-awareness for the leadership 
team.
Succession Planning in the Bank 
is a continuous process that aligns 
with the other talent management 
interventions and endeavours to 
mitigate critical people risks such as 
vacancy fulfilment, and transition risk. 
The process of development involves 
relevant role exposures, specific 
mentoring or coaching exposures and 
any specific learning need identified 
for employees, to assume higher 
responsibilities when the need arises. 
We have a comprehensive, bi-annual 
performance management system 
(PMS) in place. Every employee is 
required to make a self-assessment 
and or her own performance (biannual basis) based on the key result 
areas of his roles and responsibilities. 
The Appraiser and Appraisee have a 
joint performance discussion based 
on the self-evaluation filled by the 
Appraisee. In FY22, the PMS was 
brought on mobile with pleasant and 
easy design, facilitating qualitative 
and quantitative dialogue between 
the supervisor and the supervised. It 
seamlessly encompassed elements of 
competence and Bank values in the 
process.
Talent: acquisition and attrition
Including frontline sales staff, we hired 
57,200 employees. When compared to 
the hiring of FY21, the increase stands 
at 166%. In order to meet the growing 
requirements to outperform the market 
in identification, digital evaluation and 
quick onboarding of the best talent, 
we aim to implement the Applicant 
Tracking System in FY23.

Cares’ aims to provide resources 
and a platform for physical, mental, 
emotional and financial wellness for all 
employees.
Our wellness initiatives are aimed to 
help keep our employees and their 
families healthy and safe in a year 
that saw an unprecedented test of 
human resilience. We also introduced 
a comprehensive ‘Compassion

There is also an employee association 
at the Bank. As of FY22, 0.18% of 
our permanent employees are part 
of this association. The Bank has an 
internal Memorandum of Settlements 
that may be interpreted as a collective 
bargaining agreement, signed 
between the Management and Union 
office bearers. There are periodic 
negotiations with Union Office Bearers 
and the Memorandum of Settlement 
is signed by the Management to

Measuring employee 
engagement 
HDFC Bank continues to be 
certified as a Great Place to Work® 
Organisation. This certification is 
a testimony to the Bank's inherent 
strength as an institution par 
excellence and the efforts to support 
and enable employees through 
best-in-class people practices and 
processes.
The Bank partners with Great Place 
to Work® to conduct their employee 
engagement survey over three cycles 
(18 months per cycle). Organisations 
participating in the survey are 
assessed through two lenses — the 
Trust Index and the Culture Audit. 
Great Place to Work® Institute audits 
the company’s human resource 
practices and policies. On meeting the 
qualifying criteria, the organisation is 
certified as a Great Place to Work for a 
period of one year.
The survey was conducted for a 
second time in November 2021. Over 
94% of the eligible employees (86,506 
employees) participated and scored 
the Bank on five key parameters, 
namely, camaraderie, fairness, 
respect, pride, and credibility, amongst 
its employees.
The important distinction that this 
score brings is as follows:
Employee connect initiatives 
Over the year, we organised several 
initiatives that provide employees 
an opportunity to connect with the 
organisation beyond their work-life. 
These initiatives spanned multiple 
areas including sports, art, music, 
wellness, and photography, ensuring 
there is something in it for everyone. 
We also focused on involving family 
members which was met with 
an enthusiastic response. 43,121

through multi-dimensional interventions 
across livelihood, skill development, 
education, health, and natural resources. 
We seek to bring about a revolution in the

Parivartan – a step towards 
sustainable Sustainable 
progress
Parivartan is the Bank's umbrella 
brand for all social efforts. It 
aims to drive positive change in 
people's lives by empowering 
them, to become self-sufficient and 
integrated with the society through 
direct or indirect interventions. 
Parivartan is also at the forefront 
of natural disaster response, 
successfully restoring infrastructure 
and rehabilitating communities. 
Parivartan works under five thematic 
areas. Based on the identified focus 
areas, we have set seven goals 
and 11 sub-goals that guide our 
community development activities. 
LIVES IMPACTED*
9.6 Cr+
Our Holistic Rural Development 
Programme (HRDP) focuses on 
comprehensive development through 
activities under NRM, Education, 
Skill Development and Livelihood, 
Financial Literacy and Healthcare. 
These activities are based on the 
belief that rural development is key to 
India’s growth. The Natural Resource 
Management theme rests on the 
twin goals of enhancement of natural 
resources and their optimal utilisation 
for the economic development of the 
community. Under this theme, we 
have defined three goals. First, we 
are working to irrigate 2 Lakh acres 
of unirrigated land and cover 1 Lakh 
acres with vegetation, to increase the 
area of land under cultivation, as well 
as to increase the cropping intensity of 
cultivable land.

Second, we aim to reduce the 
carbon and ecological footprint of 
our communities by promoting clean 
and renewable energy solutions. 
This includes undertaking projects 
such as tree plantation for carbon 
sequestration and biodiversity 
conservation. We are targeting 1,000 
villages to have clean and renewable 
energy solutions and a minimum of 10 
solar lights in each village. In addition, 
we are providing solar home lights, 
biomass chulha, biogas plant, solar 
study lamp, and a solar irrigation unit, 
covering 25% of the households in 
each village. The biomass stoves have 
helped improve indoor air quality, 
creating a direct positive impact on 
women’s health. Further, we target to 
plant 2.5 Million trees by FY25.
Third, we have been promoting the use 
of chemical-free farming, to maintain 
the soil, environment, and human 
health by combining tradition, creativity 
and science. We train farmers on 
different agricultural techniques for 
improving productivity and using locally 
produced manure and fertilisers, which 
not only aid in chemical-free farming 
but also help avoid expenditures on 
chemical fertilisers.

Promotion of Education
We are implementing a programme 
to promote education in line with 
India’s Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan. Under 
this theme, we provide multi-faceted 
support to schools, to enhance the 
quality of education – which includes 
training the teachers, providing 
scholarships and career guidance 
to students, as well as infrastructure 
support to schools, such as building 
toilets and improving classrooms. 
We have dedicated programmes for 
improving teachers' skills and scaling 
up no-cost solutions for improving 
existing systems and processes. 
We have also been working towards 
establishing libraries, scientific labs 
and digital classrooms.
Under this theme, we have set the goal 
of enhancing the quality of education in 
government schools through a threedimensional, target-driven approach. 
The first dimension aims to convert 
2,500 traditional schools into smart 
schools, to establish a favourable 
learning environment and enable 
teachers to utilise various efficient 
teaching-learning methods. We have 
identified six building blocks for the 
development of smart schools and 
would be providing targeted support, 
based on a detailed need assessment 
and situational analysis of the 
availability of adequate infrastructure 
such as space and electricity.
The second dimension aims to support 
meritorious yet underprivileged 
students with scholarships, to not 
let the financial crises interrupt the 
development of bright young minds. 
We identify economically backward 
students with an annual family income 
below `2.5 Lakh and a minimum of 
55% marks on their latest available 
marksheet. 
The third dimension targets quality 
of education in schools. We aim to 
achieve 70% of students in all schools 
(those under intervention) at class 
appropriate learning (CAL) levels. The 
CAL levels are assessed as per the 
NCERT defined framework in classes 
3, 5, and 8 through the National 
Achievement Survey in language, 
mathematics, EVS, science, and social 
science.
Digital classrooms
The Smart Classrooms by Parivartan 
in the state-run schools are equipped 
with a pre-loaded projector and 
an interactive board. The in-built 
e-content is aligned with the 
concerned state curriculum, making 
learning fun and engaging for the 
students. For effective implementation 
of the digital classrooms initiative, 
the Bank provides training to the 
teachers making them the experts and 
custodians of the infrastructure.

HDFC Bank Limited Integrated Annual Report 2021-22

Under the Skills Training and Livelihood 
Enhancement theme, we focus on the 
economic development of farmers 
and youth in rural areas by providing 
means of generating income through 
agricultural or non-agricultural 
activities. Since its beginning, this 
initiative has assisted around 2.54 
Lakh+ people. The overarching 
objective is to empower the 
disadvantaged by providing them with 
greater possibilities, assisting them 
in finding local jobs, increasing their 
household income and discouraging 
migration. We also support women 
Self Help Groups (SHGs) or Joint 
Liability Groups (JLGs) by providing 
occupational skills training, financial 
literacy, credit counselling, livelihood 
finance, and market linkage. We have 
started SLI EMI collections through 
Common Service Centre operators 
(CSC VLE) providing convenience to 
customers at the village level.
We have set separate goals for 
individual and institutional capacity 
development under this theme. 
The first goal focuses on increasing 
farmers' income across the country. 
We have defined three distinct subgoals to move forward in a targeted 
and systematic way. Through the 
first sub-goal, we aim to reach 5 
Lakh small and marginal farmers 
(with annual income below `60,000) 
and support them in maximising 
output and reducing input costs. We 
are also enabling farmers to adopt 
modern and innovative farming tools 
and techniques, by providing them 
exposure visits to different fields and 
agricultural institutes, and supporting 
them with seeds, fertilisers, and other 
farm support materials. Additionally, 
we help farmers diversify their income 
by supporting them in allied activities 
such as livestock rearing, timber, 
horticulture, and fishery, among others.
The second sub-goal relates to the 
promotion of 1 Lakh communityled enterprises to boost local 
economic activities, of which ~50% 
would be women-led. Under this, 
we encourage the economically 
deprived communities to engage in 
entrepreneurship on an individual or a 
cluster basis. We support identification 
of prospective economic activities in 
the intervention villages and assist 
the community members in founding 
and operating an enterprise – which 
include beauty parlours, small shops, 
goateries, poultry, tailoring, etc. for 
individual beneficiaries, and processing 
units, packaging units, fisheries, and 
handicrafts, etc. for group enterprises, 
established through FPO, SHG, and 
JLG.
The third sub-goal relates to skill 
development for employment 
generation where we provide 
classroom/online/blended skill 
development training in trades 
that could lead to job placement 
or self-employment opportunity 
for unemployed youth, school 
dropouts and landless farmers. Our 
training programmes typically have 
certifications from the NSDC, the 
Sector Skill Council, or other qualified 
non-government agencies.
The second goal relates to the 
development and sustenance of 
institutions for livelihood enhancement 
– particularly community institutions 
such as village development 
committees, farmers’ groups, self-help 
groups, water user groups, sanitation 
committees, youth groups, and 
adolescent groups. We aim to develop 
and support 1 Lakh community 
institutions. The Bank’s intervention 
could range from a few months to 
three years. The activities are related 
to agriculture, water, sanitation, health, 
livelihood, and other rural development 
work.

Stories of Parivartan
Tehsil: Lalsot, Dausa District, Rajasthan
District: Mandi, Himachal Pradesh
Prem Devi is a small-scale 
farmer who was dealing 
with a variety of challenges, 
including poor tomato quality 
owing to inappropriate 
sapling planting, output 
losses due to numerous 
illnesses, and severe lack 
of water.
We assisted her with a hightech farming system and 
capacitated her to maximise 
profit, while lowering the cost 
of production. Drip systems, 
mulching sheet covering, 
Farmers in the Mandi district 
have become victims to 
exploitation by middlemen. 
In addition, their lack of 
negotiating power over prices 
has aggravated the situation. 
We supported market 
linkages through:
 · Formation of 45 Farmer 
Interest Groups (FIG)
 · Conducted 25 orientation 
trainings on value chain 
and value addition in apple 
production
 · Encouraged farmers to sell 
their harvest in bulk
stands, and water tanks 
were provided as part of the 
initiative to her boost her 
agricultural operations.
Since implementation of the 
intervention, the water usage 
has been reduced due to 
installation of drip systems.
Prem Devi sold roughly 150 
quintals of tomatoes, making 
a profit of `98,000. This has 
not only improved her quality 
of life, but has also motivated 
other farmers in the region.
Constructed a model apple 
processing machine to 
promote apple bi-products
Farmers now have better 
market access, with 27.63 
tonnes of apples sold 
straight from the producer. 
FIG farmers have begun 
selling their products in bulk 
and delivering it straight to 
customers. As a result, their 
negotiating strength and

We reached out to 
Covid-care hospitals in 
several states to learn 
about their needs and 
concerns, with the aim to fix 
infrastructural gaps using 
the lessons learned during 
the second and third wave.
Through the Covid Crisis 
Support Scholarship 
Programme, we are assisting 
4,000+ students who are 
experiencing personal or 
financial hardships, as 
a result of Covid. With 
monetary aid up to `75,000, 
the Bank created a specific 
initiative to help students 
In collaboration with 
the Apparel Made-Ups 
and Home Furnishings 
Sector Skill Council, we 
have trained over 5000 
women across six states in 
apparel-related job areas. 
This included awareness/
counseling sessions, quality 
training sessions, provision 
of learning materials, toolkit 
etc.
We have also set up a team 
to followup and support the 
applicants to get employed 
at top companies.
We aim to place women 
candidates in top national 
and international companies. 
We are setting up a team 
to follow and support the

to those pursuing UG and PG 
programmes.
We are increasing the oxygen 
capacity in 18 hospitals 
around the country to better 
prepare for the approaching

Our 
Targets

We have adopted an integrated 
approach related to healthcare and 
hygiene. We have not only been 
provisioning healthcare services 
to our communities in the form of 
health clinics, nutrition programmes 
and immunisation drives, but have 
also been working on hygiene 
and sanitation in schools and 
communities. To complement our 
community-led sanitation efforts 
directed toward the proper disposal 
of wastewater, we have been 
working on the institutionalisation 
of waste pickers through social and 
financial inclusion for dry waste 
management. 
Under this thematic area, we have set 
the goal to improve sanitation facilities 
– which we are implementing through 
targeted efforts on three distinct subgoals. The three sub-goals are related 
to waste management, clean drinking 
water and household sanitation 
facilities. 
Under the first sub-goal, we are 
developing waste management 
systems in 1,000 settlements. We are 
committed to establishing a long-term 
solid waste management system by 
providing the necessary infrastructure 
and instilling the necessary behavioural 
changes toward responsible 
consumption, source segregation and 
litter prevention. This includes settingup materials recovery facilities (MRF) 
and recycling facilities in 15 ULBs, in 
addition to village-level interventions 
such as residential composting, 
door-to-door garbage collection and 
the related mechanisms for user 
fee collection, compost sales and 
recycling. 
We are targeting 1,000 communities 
for providing access to clean drinking 
water. This would include interventions 
to promote clean drinking water 
availability at both the communitylevel (through Jal-minar or other water 
buildings) as well as at the family-level 
(piped water connection). Through 
these interventions, three litres of 
water per person per day will be 
made available. We are also forming 
and orienting water user groups to 
ensure sustenance of the services who 
would be entrusted with post-project 
maintenance and water quality testing.
The third sub-goal pertains to 
ensuring that 100% of households 
have acceptable sanitation facilities. 
While the Government of India is 
believed to have provided sanitation 
facilities to every household, we are 
supplementing the government’s 
efforts by working towards 
enhancing the usage of such facilities 
by undertaking soft initiatives 
like awareness and motivation, 
infrastructure-based interventions, to 
support the repair and upgradation of 
such facilities, if and where required.

Financial Literacy and Inclusion
The first step towards true financial 
inclusion is financial literacy. Financial 
literacy camps are periodically 
conducted at our branches. In 
addition, we have set up financial 
literacy centres across India. We 
are also working with our non-profit 
partners to enhance financial literacy. 
The camps are designed to provide 
communities with information about 
the fundamentals of saving, investing 
and organised finance, enabling them 
to make informed decisions. Digidhan, 
our flagship plan under this pillar, is a 
mobile financial literacy programme 
that travels the length and breadth of 
the country's hinterland, presenting 
the advantages of digital banking in an 
audio-visual format.

HDFC Bank continued its journey 
to contribute to nation–building 
by digitising payments, collecting 
direct, indirect, and local taxes, 
and facilitating digital commerce by 
integrating with various Government 
owned platforms like e–National 
Agricultural Marketplace, and 
Government e–marketplace and 
offering banking solutions to 
unbanked and underserved sections 
of the society. The focus is to ensure 
the unbanked sections of the society 
are provided relevant financing 
and other banking services. As a 
responsible banker, we aim to deliver 
relevant banking solutions through 
partnerships with Government and 
other entities. The goal is to enable 
easier availability of funds and 
facilitate ease of doing business 
for beneficiaries such as farmers, 
students, teachers, and healthcare 
workers, amongst others.
Nation Building
Contributing to 
India’s development
As a socially responsible citizen, HDFC Bank 
endeavours to contribute to nation-building 
by remaining focused on key areas. These 
include digitising workflows and helping 
build alternate channels for the Government, 
supporting the start-up ecosystem to help 
fuel the economy further and supporting the 
Government’s financial inclusion agenda. 

Helping the Government 
digitise fund distribution 
efficiently
The bank plays a major role in 
distribution of the Government’s funds 
for most major schemes like central 
sponsored schemes, central sector 
schemes and funds from the 15th 
Finance Commission. 
The Bank is one of the top 5 banks 
processing Government pay-outs 
including Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) 
and has also been recognised by the 
Ministries of Finance, Panchayati Raj and

The Bank's integration with various 
platforms demonstrates continued 
contribution to the Government’s ‘Ease

initiatives. The Bank has integrated with 
the following platforms:
 · ‘ICEGATE’ (Indian Customs and 
Central Excise Electronic Commerce/ 
Electronic Data Interchange Gateway)
 · National Agriculture Markets (eNAM)
 · FOIS system (Freight Operations 
Information System) of Indian 
Railways
The Bank’s long association with GeM 
portal, which facilitates procurement

facility to deposit caution money that 
suppliers must deposit with GeM, prior 
to becoming active on the platform.
Improving our foreign ties

Nation Building
Developing our children, 
our future
The Bank recognises the importance 
of today’s youth in shaping the future 
of the nation. Accordingly, it works at 
many levels to support the country’s 
education system.
HDFC Bank has been a key player in 
extending the reach of Government 
schemes that help school children. 
It has enabled state education 
departments to disburse funds to 
Government schools for fulfiling the 
nutritional needs under the Mid-Day 
Meal Scheme. The Bank has also 
helped disburse funds to the last mile 
under the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyaan 
Scheme, a Centrally Sponsored 
Scheme focused on making quality 
education available to students.
Disbursements to 1 
Lakh+ schools benefitting 
1 Cr+ students under 
Mid-day Meal Scheme
Further, the Bank has enhanced its 
education loan offering to students to 
enable larger numbers to avail quality 
education programmes. This has been 
achieved by removing the cap on 
loan values and widening the range of 
courses for which they can be used.
Additionally, the Bank has worked 
with Education Boards to digitise 
the payment of remuneration to 
faculty who offer their services during 
examinations. This has expedited 
the pace of these payments, brought 
transparency to the process, 
and ultimately resulted in higher 
participation rates by faculty members 
to conduct examinations seamlessly. 
Online submission of claims has also 
helped the boards and faculties of 
these institutions overcome logistical 
challenges posed by the pandemic 
in submitting and processing such 
claims. 
The Bank also recognises the critical 
role played by educators and has been 
committed to improving their lives. 
A new initiative under the banner of 
#SalaamDilSey was launched this year 
for Teacher’s Day. Industry leaders 
from across the HDFC Group and 
others spoke at a special webinar 
aimed at helping teachers simplify 
their family finances. Attended by 
1,300+ teachers, the webinar was 
well-received and will now become an 
annual affair given its success.

Boosting and protecting 
farmer incomes
The Bank has been consistently 
assisting the Government focused 
sectors such as agriculture and allied 
industries.
In line with the Central Government’s 
focus on developing Farmer Producer 
Organisations (FPO), the Bank has 
powered the platform created by a 
state agriculture department with 
integrated digital payment channels. 
This has enhanced farmers’ access 
to a common platform for trading and 
buying agri-produce and supplies. 
The platform has also helped revenue 
optimisation on crop yields by farmers. 
The Bank has also helped digitise 
the financial operations for the dairy 
industry by offering an integrated 
solution for the entire ecosystem, thus 
driving transparency in the process and 
improving planning since it provides 
visibility into both the demand and 
supply ends of the business. 
In the current year, your Bank became 
the first private sector Bank to be 
empanelled with the Agriculture 
Insurance Company of India (AIC), for 
marketing their insurance products. 
Through this partnership, the Bank aims 
to provide financial security and income 
stability to farmers, in the event of natural 
calamities that affect their crop yield.

Making India healthy
The Bank extended its focus on 
healthcare during the pandemic. It 
enabled the smooth transfer of funds 
from state apex bodies to primary and 
secondary healthcare centres and 
village level hospitals. Our services 
also included digitisation of processes, 
expenditure reporting, providing digital 
platforms for centralised monitoring of 
fund utilisation, etc. The Bank has also 
enabled state health departments to 
distribute funds in a timely manner to 
ASHA Workers as compensation for 
extending healthcare services to end 
beneficiaries.
The pandemic provided new avenues 
for customising banking solutions 
across various segments. With 
the continued focus on enhancing 
affordability, we have enabled several 
large partner hospitals/clinics/IVF 
centres to provide loans and the ability 
to conveniently convert healthcare 
treatment costs to EMIs. 
These cost-effective solutions will help 
customers avail quality healthcare 
with ease and flexibility. Our SmartBuy

platform provides a large range of

The Bank has alliances with 150+ 
providers including players in 
diagnostic, pharmaceutical and 
hospital care. Attractive membership 
benefit programmes are provided to 
customers as a value-added service 
across segments. 
Two special programmes, providing 
customised banking and financial 
services benefits have also been 
created especially for doctors. 
Digitisation and modernisation 
of citizen services
The Bank continued its participation 
in the digitisation and modernisation 
of Government to Citizen (G2C) 
services. This has not only helped 
optimise resources in Government 
organisations but also helped 
deliver services remotely. It includes 
services like payment of taxes, online 
collections of charges and fees by 
transport authorities as well as online 
tracking of case status with legal 
authorities like Motor Accident Claim 
Tribunals (MACT). This has also helped 
the authorities deliver un-interrupted 
services during the pandemic.
Taking banking to the 
unbanked
The Bank continued to leverage 
Common Service Centres (CSCs) 
to reach the last mile. The Bank 
expanded its product range in the 
last year to include all liability, assets 
and payments products. We also 
initiated the delivery of Government 
sponsored social security schemes 
and enabled Business Correspondents 
to assist in collection of delinquent 
EMIs. Managed by Village Level 
Entrepreneurs (VLEs), the CSCs 
are instrumental in increasing our 
penetration in deeper geographies. 
The distribution network built through 

CSC now includes 4 Lakh+ centres 
across India for banking services. Of 
this, more than 68% are in semi-urban 
and rural areas. We also have 15,000+ 
centres enabled across India for 
conducting banking transactions. 
Social Security Schemes: 
17,500+ enrolled 
for SSL schemes 
across APY, JBY & SBY
EMIs collected: 62,000+ 
transactions across Retail 
and SLI/JLG loans
The approach in deeper geographies 
is based on the ecosystem around 
the distribution network, our 
digital capabilities and rule-based 
underwriting to provide seamless 
service. In the process of training our 
VLEs, which includes women, we 
equip them with digital skills and make 
them self-reliant by enabling them to 
function as a small branch. To scale 
further into deeper geographies by 
replicating our success with CSC, we 
have also signed MOUs with additional 
partners. We are driven by the 
aspiration to provide banking products 
and services to the vast unbanked and 
underserved sections of the society.
Women empowerment is furthered 
by training 1.3 Lakh+ women from 
19,600+ SHGs, making them 
financially self-reliant and positively 
impacting the lives of more than 6 
Lakh fellow countrymen in semi urban 
and rural areas. Under the Stree 
Swabhiman initiative, sanitary napkin 
making units have been provided 
to women VLEs, to manufacture 
economic and hygienic pads. These 
are provided to 12,500 school-going 
girls who have been adopted for a year 
by the Bank, thereby creating an ecosystem of menstrual hygiene access.
10 Lakh citizens in the 
hinterlands were able to 
register for their COVID-19 
vaccinations at CSCs 
with the Bank’s support. 
Registration costs for 
all 10 Lakh citizens was 
funded by the Bank.
Driving digitisation in Rural 
Banking
We have integrated 30+ APIs which 
power the digital delivery of 25+ 
best-in-class financial products and 
services to the last mile customer. 
We have also funded the digital 
infrastructure set-up for 4,000 villages 
supporting the Digi Gaon initiative of 
the Government.

Governance
The DNA of a 
responsible banker 
Our governance framework forms 
the bedrock of our value creation 
process. At HDFC Bank, stringent 
regulatory compliance is a given. 
Beyond compliance, our practices 
aim to embody the principles of 
ethical conduct, independence, 
responsibility, accountability, and 
transparency in true spirit. This is 
reflected in our strategic thinking, 
decision-making, monitoring 
processes and underlines all our 
activities and operations.
We are led by a diverse, experienced and 
competent Board. The Board, along with its 
committees, institutes policies and frameworks 
on ethical conduct, anti-corruption, anti-money 
laundering, compliance, IT, information security, 
ESG, and customer satisfaction, among 
others, and monitors their implementation. We 
strive to adhere to best practices in corporate 
governance, such as alignment of executive 
pay to company performance, disclosure of 
Board evaluation outcomes, and wide scope of 
whistle-blower policy, to name a few.

Board expertise and 
competence
Our Board is diverse and inclusive, 
comprising of members with rich 
experience to fulfil its governance 
role and related responsibilities, 
objectively and effectively. Our 
Board includes members with 
varied skill sets and competencies

such as finance, agriculture, rural 
economy, risk management, small 
scale industries and technology. 
The Board also seeks opinions from 
external experts whenever required. 
Further information on the skills, 
expertise and competence of our 
Board is included in our Corporate 
Governance Report on Page 385.
Beyond compliance
At HDFC Bank, compliance with 
regulatory requirements is just the 
starting point for good governance 
practices. We have consistently 
ensured that the composition of the 
Board and its Committees, in terms 
of independence, diversity in skills, 
expertise and gender, meets and 
at times, exceeds the requirements 
prescribed by regulations.
We ensure a high level of independence in the composition of 
our Board Committees. The below Committees are chaired by an 
independent director.

Board initiatives and 
involvement
The Board provides leadership and 
strategic guidance in shaping our 
procedures and processes for value 
creation. The key focus areas in FY22 
included adherence to regulatory 
compliance, creating a strong 
technological backbone to mitigate IT 
and operational risks, infrastructure 
scalability, talent management and 
ESG commitments.
Culture of transparency and 
accountability
We strive to inculcate global best 
practices in governance, timely 
disclosures and fair presentation 
of information. Transparency and 
accountability are among the key 
expectations of stakeholders. We have 
put in place policies and processes 
that allow for a sufficient and visible 
flow of information with adequate 
safeguards in place. We have also 
formulated a Code of Practices and 
Procedures for Fair Disclosures in 
accordance with the SEBI (Prohibition 
of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2015. 
This Code lays down principles of 
prompt disclosure along with uniform 
and universal dissemination of 
information. Further, the Board has 
also approved the following policies 
which are available on our website: 
https://www.hdfcbank.com/personal/
about-us/corporate-governance/
codes-and-policies for easy reference:
 · Policy on Appointment and Fit and 
Proper criteria for Directors
 · Whistle Blower Policy
 · Compensation Policy
Policies and frameworks for 
ethical conduct
To ensure a pervasive culture of 
ethical behaviour, we have created an 
environment and instituted policies 
and frameworks that encourage 
appropriate business conduct. These 
policies are communicated regularly to 
the management, employees and other 
stakeholders.
Our corporate governance policies 
include: 
 · Code of Ethics/Conduct
 · Policies to prevent insider trading, 
govern related-party transactions
 · Policies around Prevention of Sexual 
Harassment (POSH)
 · Environmental Social & Governance 
(ESG) Policy Framework
Transparency and accountability 
are embedded in our culture. Our 
Code of Ethics/Conduct directs the 
Board and senior management to 
uphold our values and carry out 
business worldwide with integrity 
and highest ethical standards. As 
per our Conduct Philosophy, we 
do not employ child, forced or 
compulsory labour in our operations. 
Our Whistle-blower Policy provides 
a comprehensive framework for 
capturing and addressing stakeholder 
complaints/grievances. In FY22, we 
had 147 whistle-blower complaints 
filed by various stakeholders including 
shareholders, employees, customers 
and value chain partners. The nature 
of complaints varied; while some were 
linked to corruption and improper 
business practices, others pertained to 
behavioural issues. We did not make 
any political contributions. 
Our publicly available Conduct 
Philosophy codifies mechanisms to 
deal with issues related to mental or 
physical coercion or verbal abuse, 
sexual harassment, sexual abuse, 
slavery, of employees. During 
FY22, there were no complaints of 
infringement of human rights. 
We have a ‘Zero Tolerance’ policy on 
sexual harassment and an internal 
complaints committee is in place to 
address such complaints. During 
the year, we received 51 complaints 
pertaining to sexual harassment, 
of which 48 were resolved during 
the year. For more information, please

Act and Bribery Act, Code of Ethics 
and Commitment, Trade-based 
Money Laundering, and KYC and 
AML norms to enable effective training 
on anti-corruption, anti-bribery and 
anti-money laundering. Our operations 
are assessed for corruption and any 
complaints by any stakeholder can 
be raised through our whistle-blower 
mechanism.

Customer satisfaction 
The Customer Service Committee 
of the Board (CSCB) works towards 
continuously improving the quality of 
services rendered to the customer. 
It also ensures the implementation 
of directives received from the RBI in 
this regard. Accordingly, the CSCB 
formulates the Bank’s comprehensive 
deposit policy, incorporating the issues 
arising out of the product approval 
process, annual survey of depositor 
satisfaction, and the triennial audit 
of such services, among others. We 
ensure strict adherence to market 
conduct regulations and have defined 
frameworks in place to maintain 
transparency in communications to our 
customers and clients. During FY22, 
we did not record any new cases of 
non-compliance concerning product 
and service information and labelling, 
or marketing communications.
During the year, we undertook several 
initiatives to strengthen our IT systems, 
augment capabilities and increase 
resiliency. To read more about our 
initiatives, refer Pg. 78 (Digitisation). 
During FY22, we received no 
complaints regarding identified leaks, 
thefts, or losses of customer data 
with respect to data security. During 
the same period, we received 298 
complaints from customers concerning 
breaches of customer privacy, 1 
complaint from an outside party 
and 19 from regulatory bodies. The 
major areas of customer complaints 
in FY22 were related to unauthorised 
transactions done through UPI, 
unauthorised usage through Credit 
Card, unauthorised transactions done 
through NetBanking, unauthorised 
usage through Debit Card online and 
failed transactions at the Bank's ATMs.
We have a transparent Grievance 
Redressal Mechanism that ensures 
quick and effective resolution of 
complaints. Customers can reach 
out to us through multiple channels 
including retail branches, phone 
banking application, website and 
net banking application and retail 
asset customer service centres. Any 
grievance received, either verbally, 
by email or in writing, if not resolved 
and responded to on the same day, 
is logged into CRMnext – a stateof-the-art web-based system or 
Vision Plus (for Credit Card related 
issues). The CRMnext system has the 
capability to record and categorise 
grievances into different types and 
maintain turnaround times (TAT) for 
specific category/sub-category. It also 
has an auto escalation mechanism 
for cases not resolved within the 
defined TAT. This not only ensures 
proper recording and resolution of 
cases, but also provides for effective 
escalation channels in case of delays 
in resolution. Acknowledgement is 
provided for every grievance logged, 
in the form of a Complaint Reference 
Number (CRN), and the customer is 
kept informed in case of any delay 
envisaged by the Bank, in resolution 
of the grievance beyond the stated 
timelines. 
Apart from direct grievances from 
customers, grievances received 
through various regulatory bodies 
including Reserve Bank of India and 
Banking Ombudsman are handled 
by designated Nodal Officers. The 
Bank has also appointed an Internal 
Ombudsman as per the guidelines 
prescribed by the Reserve Bank of 
India. Denial/partial denial cases are 
referred to the Internal Ombudsman for 
guidance. The decision of the Internal 
Ombudsman is binding on the Bank.
ESG governance
ESG matters are a vital component in 
the Bank’s governance framework. The 
CSR and ESG Committee of the Board 
oversees the Bank’s sustainability 
and climate change initiatives. The 
Board level committee is guided by 
the ESG apex committee. The ESG 
apex committee that comprises of 
key representatives from the senior 
management, oversees sustainability 
reporting initiatives, climate change 
disclosures, internal projects to ensure 
reduction of our overall emissions and 
tracks its progress on ESG, to achieve 
industry leadership. This Committee is 
further supported by ESG action subcommittees which includes Product 
Responsibility Sub-committee, which 
looks at ESG risks (including climate 
risks) in the existing portfolio and ESGlinked opportunities; the Environment 
Sub-committee which oversees 
the environmental impact from our 
operations and Social and Governance 
Sub-committee which works on 
workplace policies and governance 
initiatives.

HDFC Bank Limited Integrated Annual Report 2021-22

Directors’ Report
Dear Stakeholders,
Your Directors take great pleasure in presenting the 28th 
Annual Report on the business and financial operations of your 
Bank, together with the audited accounts for the year ended 
March 31, 2022.
Like last year, let me start by wishing all of you health and 
happiness on behalf of the HDFC Bank family. The entire 
world has learnt the importance of this all over again during 
the pandemic.
The good news is that the pandemic more or less appears to be 
behind us, thanks to the pick-up in the vaccination program rolled 
out by the Union Government and the virus mutants being less 
and less dangerous. As the shadow over the health of individuals 
lifts, the health of the economy has been improving too.
India’s GDP grew by 8.7 per cent in FY 2021-22 compared to 
a contraction of 6.6 per cent in FY 2020-21 as per the Central 
Statistical Organisation (CSO), surpassing pre-pandemic 
levels of output. The biggest drivers of growth were pick up 
in investment and exports. Capital expenditure was led by the 
Union Government, with the private sector playing a supporting 
role. The Government and the RBI also announced a host of 
measures to contain the impact of the second wave on domestic 
economic activity. This was followed by stepping up allocation 
on capital expenditure in the Union Budget for FY 2022-23 by 
24.5 per cent to ` 7.5 lakh crore.
The economy now faces headwinds from rising inflationary 
pressures brought about by supply chain disruptions and 
geopolitical tensions, particularly the Ukraine crisis. This can 
affect private consumption, lead to reduced profit margins due 
to rising input costs and slowdown the recovery in the private 
sector capital expenditure cycle. 
In an effort to contain inflation, the RBI on May 4, 2022 in an off 
cycle announcement, hiked the policy rate by 40 basis points 
to 4.4 per cent and increased the Cash Reserve Ratio by 50 
basis points to 4.5 per cent. It further hiked the Repo Rate by 
another 50 points to 4.90 per cent in the June 8, 2022 Monetary 
Policy announcement. 
To sum up, despite the current headwinds, India is expected 
to be the fastest growing economy in the world in FY 202223, clocking a 7.3 per cent growth rate, and is well poised to 
withstand any external volatility and shocks.
(For more details, please refer to the Macroeconomic and 
Industry section on page no. 135)
In spite of the challenges, your Bank continued on its growth 
path by conducting its business responsibly and reinforcing its 
commitment to the environment and community at large.
Financial Parameters
Your Bank recorded an improvement in a majority of its key 
financial parameters, largely due to its prudent credit evaluation 
of targeted customers and diversified loan book across 
customer segments, products, and sectors. Managing riskreturn decisions with discipline was an important element in 
the Bank’s performance. Net Profit at ` 36,961.3 crore went up 
by 18.8 per cent. Net Interest Income at ` 72,009.6 crore rose 
11.0 per cent. Net Interest Margin stood at 4.0 per cent. Gross 
Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) at 1.17 per cent was among the 
lowest in the industry.
GNPA
1.17 per cent
Among the lowest in the industry
Parivartan
Your Bank continued to transform lives through its umbrella CSR 
brand, Parivartan, which denotes change.
The Bank believes that businesses can only prosper if the 
communities in which they operate prosper as well. This belief 
has inspired its social initiatives, which have potentially made a 
difference to the lives of over 9.6 crore people, predominantly 
in rural India. Driving this change is the Sustainable Livelihood 
Initiative (SLI) team, which works on improving livelihood

opportunities. The ‘Teaching-The-Teacher’ initiative has 
impacted over 2 crore students since inception. The Holistic Rural 
Development Programme has touched 9.88 lakh households 
across more than 3,335 villages. Having an umbrella brand 
enables the Bank to lend a sharper focus to these efforts. 
Your Directors are also happy to report that your Bank met the 
mandatory CSR expenditure through a spend of 736.01 crore.

Summary
The economy recovered in FY 2021-22 and India is 
expected to be the fastest growing economy in the world in 
FY 2022-23. There are of course inflationary pressures, but the 
country has the ability to absorb these and the uncertainties 
brought about by geopolitical issues. In the long run, the market 
presents tremendous opportunities given the sheer level of 
under penetration of banking services in the country. Your Bank 
is well positioned to capitalise on these opportunities given the 
strength of its franchise. It has geared up for the years ahead 
through its Future Ready Strategy. This can be envisaged as 10 
strategic pillars backed by key enablers to catalyse, create and 
capture the next wave of growth. (To know more about this 
please refer to page no. 32)
Your Bank is also poised to make a greater contribution to 
bridge the urban-rural divide through both its business and 
social activities and help build a country where more can 
prosper together.
This will, of course, not be possible without the contribution of 
the ever-growing family of over two lakh employees (including 
those of the subsidiaries) across the country, who remain at the 
forefront of taking your Bank forward every day. In the previous 
two financial years, which were characterised by the pandemic, 
our colleagues went beyond the call of duty to keep the bank 
functioning. Many of them soldiered on despite the loss of loved 
ones. We also lost some colleagues during the pandemic.
While we structured and delivered a compassion package to 
the families of the deceased, no word or action can adequately 
convey our sorrow.
Your Directors would also like to place on record that we did 
not reduce salaries during this trying period. Your Bank paid 
bonuses and increments on time in the year under review and 
followed the normal promotion cycle. It is doing the same this 
year as well.
Mission and Strategic Focus
Your Bank’s mission is to be a ‘World-Class Indian Bank’. Its 
business philosophy is based on five core values: Customer 
Focus, Operational Excellence, Product Leadership, People 
and Sustainability. Sustainability should be viewed in unison with 
Environmental, Social and Governance performance. As a part 
of this, your Bank, through its umbrella CSR brand Parivartan, 
seeks to bring about change in the lives of communities mainly 
in rural India.
During the year under review, the Bank did not lose its human 
touch but continued building sound customer franchises across 
distinct businesses to achieve healthy growth in profitability 
consistent with your Bank’s risk appetite.
In line with the above objective, the Bank aims to take digitalisation 
to the next level to:
Deliver superior experience and greater convenience 
to customers
Increase market share in India’s growing banking and 
financial services industry
Expand geographical reach
Cross-sell the broad financial product portfolio
Sustain strong asset quality through disciplined credit 
risk management
Maintain low cost of funds
Your Bank remains committed to the highest levels of ethical 
standards, professional integrity, corporate governance, and 
regulatory compliance, which is articulated in its Code of 
Conduct. Every employee affirms to abide by the Code annually.

Management Discussion and Analysis
Macroeconomic and Industry Developments
The Indian economy expanded in FY 2021-22, surpassing 
pre-pandemic levels of output. As per the Central Statistical 
Organisation, GDP grew by 8.7 per cent compared with a 
contraction of 6.6 per cent in FY 2020-21. Growth was supported 
by reopening of the economy and a pick-up in the vaccination 
rate. Private consumption recovery picked up pace (registered 
a growth of 7.9 per cent in FY 2021-22) and rose above prepandemic levels. The biggest support came from a pick-up 
in investment (supported by Government capital expenditure 
and some revival in private capital expenditure) and strong 
export growth.
In addition, both the Central Government and the RBI announced 
a host of measures to contain the impact of the second wave 
on domestic economic activity. The Government focused on 
providing relief and credit flow to small business, health, tourism 
sectors and other service sectors that were affected by the 
pandemic. On the monetary policy side, the RBI kept its stance 
accommodative and policy rates unchanged at 4.0 per cent 
in FY 2021-22 and announced measures to provide liquidity 
support. Some of the measures included extension of Targeted 
Long Term Repo Operations (TLTRO), providing on-tap liquidity 
window for contact intensive sectors, and extension of priority 
sector lending.
Economic activity is poised to gain further momentum in FY 202223 supported by a recovery in consumption, continued rise in 
exports and a push through Government capital expenditure. In 
the Union Budget for FY 2022-23, the Government increased 
its allocation on capital expenditure by 24.5 per cent (from 
FY 2021- 22 Revised Estimates) to ` 7.5 lakh crore. In addition, 
it announced measures in the Union Budget for FY 2022-23 
such as extension of credit guarantee scheme by a year and 
an increase in guaranteed amount earmarked for the hospitality 
sector. This was to address the sectors worst affected by 
the pandemic.

Directors’ Report
However, recent geopolitical tensions do present some 
headwinds for the growth outlook. Higher crude oil prices and 
resulting higher fuel and transportation costs are likely to weigh 
on private consumption. In addition, higher input costs are likely 
to put stress on profit margins and could slow down the recovery 
in the private capex cycle. Moreover, lower global growth (due 
to a slowdown in China and geopolitical tensions) could have a 
bearing on India’s export demand. The International Monetary 
Fund expects the world economy to grow at a slower pace of 3.6 
per cent in 2022 from 6.1 per cent in 2021. On balance, India’s 
GDP growth is expected to rise by 7.3 per cent in FY 2022-23, 
making it the fastest growing economy in the world. External 
stability related indicators (short-term debt, Forex reserves, FDI 
flows) show that India is better positioned than the 2013 taper 
tantrum episode to withstand shocks.
Besides growth, geopolitical tensions and lingering supply side 
disruptions are likely to weigh on domestic retail inflation as well. 
CPI headline inflation rose to an 8-year high of 7.8 per cent in 
April-22 (vs. 6.95 per cent in March-22) led by a broad-based 
increase in food prices, which rose to a 17-month high, fuel and 
core inflation (CPI excluding food and fuel). Core inflation rose 
to around 8-year high of 7.0 per cent in Apr-22. Going forward, 
CPI inflation is expected to average at 7.3 per cent in H1 FY23 
and ease to 6.2 per cent in H2 FY23 assuming crude oil prices 
average at USD 105 pbl in FY23. For the full FY23, CPI infation 
is expected to average at 6.7 per cent, assuming a normal 
monsoon, some moderation in global commodity prices in H2, 
and elevated services inflation. Support from recently announced 
excise duty cuts on petrol and diesel is likely to be offset by some 
pass through of high crude oil prices to pump prices by Oil 
Marketing Companies to cover up their under recoveries.
To rein in elevated inflation amid Russia-Ukraine crisis, the RBI 
raised rate by 40 bps in an off-cycle meeting on 4th May 2022 
and delivered another rate hike of 50 bps in its June 2022 policy, 
taking the repo rate to 4.9%. The central bank justified its rate 
action as a step to control the second-round impact of inflationary 
pressures and an effort to anchor inflation expectations. The RBI 
raised its inflation forecast by 100 bps to 6.7% for FY23. On the 
liquidity front, the central bank reiterated that it would provide 
enough liquidity in the system --- balancing any change due to 
its FX operations, Government spending or seasonality - in a 
manner that the normalization is non-disruptive for growth. The 
average liquidity in the system as of May 2022 stood at INR 5.2 
lakh crore. The MPC voted to remain focused on withdrawal 
of accommodation in a calibrated fashion to ensure inflation 
remains within the RBI’s upper band while supporting growth. 
The RBI dropped the phrase “remain accommodative” from 
its stance. RBI’s concern about the broad-based nature of the 
increase in inflation and the risk of the second-round impact on 
inflation expectations makes a case for an aggressive path by the 
central bank going forward. The policy rate is likely to be raised 
well beyond the pre-pandemic level, close to 5.75-6% by fiscal 
year-end. (HDFC Bank expectations). 
Overall, the Indian economy recovered from the impact of the 
pandemic in FY 2021-22 and is estimated to be the fastest 
growing economy in the world in FY 2022-23. Though there are 
new headwinds that could cloud the economic outlook, India is 
better positioned (as gauged by external indicators) to withstand 
extreme volatile episodes/shocks.
Financial Performance
The financial performance of your Bank during the year ended 
March 31, 2022, remained healthy with Total Net Revenue 
(Net Interest Income plus Other Income) rising 12.7 per cent 
to ` 101,519.5 crore from ` 90,084.5 crore in the previous year. 
Revenue growth was driven by an increase in both Net Interest 
Income and Other Income. Net Interest Income grew by 11.0 
per cent to ` 72,009.6 crore coupled with a Net Interest Margin 
(NIM) of 4.0 per cent.
Total Net Revenue
12.7 per cent growth
Other Income grew by 17.1 per cent to ` 29,509.9 crore. The 
largest component was Fees and Commissions at ` 19,536.6 
crore. Gain on Revaluation and Sale of Investments was 
` 2,282.6 crore. Foreign Exchange and Derivatives Revenue 
was ` 3,907.9 crore, and recoveries from written-off accounts 
were ` 2,765.1 crore.
The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic had led to a nationwide lockdown in April-May 2020. This was followed by localised 
lockdowns in areas with a significant number of COVID-19 
cases. Following the easing of lockdown measures, there was 
an improvement in economic activity in the second half of fiscal 
2021. Since then, India experienced two waves of the COVID-19 
pandemic following the discovery of mutant coronavirus variants, 
leading to the reimposition of regional lockdowns which were 
subsequently lifted. The impact of COVID-19, including changes 
in customer behaviour and pandemic fears, as well as restrictions 
on business and individual activities, led to significant volatility in 
global and Indian financial markets and a significant decrease in 
global and local economic activities. The disruptions following 
the outbreak impacted loan originations, the sale of third-party 
products, the use of credit and debit cards by customers and the 
efficiency in collection efforts resulting in increase in customer 
defaults and consequent increase in provisions there against. 
India is emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent 
to which any new wave of COVID-19 will impact the Bank's 
results will depend on ongoing as well as future developments, 
including, among other things, any new information concerning 
the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any action to contain 
its spread or mitigate its impact whether Government-mandated 
or elected by us.

Business Review
Your Bank’s operations are split into Domestic and International.
A) Domestic Business comprises the following:
Retail Banking
The Retail Business operated under challenging circumstances 
in the year under review but these were less pronounced 
compared with the previous year. This business is directly 
linked to consumption, which slowed down in general during 
the lockdown. The lockdown was less severe in the year under 
review and as the unlock gathered momentum, the business 
too gained momentum with Domestic Retail Advances rising 
by 13.7 per cent.
Domestic Retail Deposits grew by 18.5 per cent to ` 1,262,093 
crore from ` 1,064,684 crore in the preceding year, while 
Retail Advances rose 13.7 per cent to ` 599,608 crore from 
` 527,586 crore.
Personal Loans continue to exhibit strong growth with overall 
portfolio reaching ` 1,40,000 crore at the end of the year. 
A greater focus on the Government segment as well as top 
corporates resulted in improved portfolio quality.
This year, your Bank maintained leadership position in Auto 
Loan segment, which underwent supply chain constraints, by 
outpacing industry growth, thus increasing marketshare and 
crossing ` 100,000 crore.
There is continued focus on digitalising processes and customer 
touchpoints to better your Bank’s reach. After the great success 
of Personal Loan in 10 Seconds, Digital Loan Against Shares 
and Digital Loan against Mutual Funds, the Bank has recently 
launched an end-to-end digital car loan process (Application 
to Disbursement). This is an industry first car loan process with 
a completely digital, contactless and paperless experience, 
wherein New to the Bank customers can avail disbursement 
within 30 Minutes (which includes Video KYC Process) and 
existing pre-approved customers can get loan disbursement in 
10 seconds.
The Payments Business, where your Bank has a strong 
presence not only acts as a catalyst for cashless transactions 
but also spurs consumption. With 4.30 crore debit cards, 1.65 
crore credit cards and about 28.94 lakh acceptance points, it 
is among the largest facilitators of cashless payments in the 
country. Your Bank’s payments business has launched digital 

Directors’ Report
offerings such as Bharat QR Code, UPI, and SMS pay solutions. 
It has also pioneered products such as the SmartHub app for 
small merchants and DigiPos, which enables traditional PoS 
machines to accept digital payments.
RBI, through its order dated December 2, 2020, advised 
your Bank to immediately (i) stop sourcing of new credit card 
customers and (ii) stop all launches of digital business generating 
activities planned under program Digital 2.0. 
RBI lifted the restrictions on new credit card acquisitions in 
August 2021 followed by the removal of the embargo on the 
Digital 2.0 program in March 2022. 
The Bank has since been working on the following four pillars: 
making credit cards more powerful and customer focused, 
entering into strategic alliances and forging partnerships, 
enhancing focus on customers’ experience and complaints and 
digitalising the user journeys
Credit cards in force

crore
The Virtual Relationship Management practice is an integrated 
customer centric approach covering three pillars - Virtual 
Relationships, Virtual Sales and Virtual Care. A banking 
experience with digital ease and personalised conversations is 
at the core of our VRM strategy. As digital or contactless banking 
became a necessity during the pandemic, this programme gained 
further traction in the year under review. Under VRM, relationship 
managers reach out to customers through remote and digital 
platforms resulting in deeper and cost effective engagement. 
As digital literacy and exposure increases exponentially, VRMs 
are gaining wider acceptance through deeper engagement and 
relationships backed by a strong product offering. 
Meanwhile, your Bank also added 734 branches during the 
year, taking the total to 6,342. As of March 31, 2022, the Bank’s 
distribution network was at 6,342 branches and 18,130 ATMs / 
Cash Deposit & Withdrawal Machines (CDMs) across 3,188 cities 
/ towns as against 5,608 branches and 16,087 ATMs / CDMs 
across 2,902 cities / towns as of March 31, 2021. Fifty per cent of 
our branches are in semi-urban and rural areas. In addition, the 
Bank has 15,341 business correspondents, which are primarily 
manned by Common Service Centres (CSCs). The total number 
of customers your Bank catered to as on March 31, 2022 was 
over 7.10 crore, up from over 6.18 crore in the previous year.
As you are aware, your Bank operates in the Home Loan Business 
in conjunction with HDFC Limited. As per this arrangement, your 
Bank sells HDFC home loans while HDFC Limited approves and 
disburses them. Your Bank receives sourcing fee for these loans 
and as per the arrangement, has the option to purchase up to 70 
per cent of fully disbursed loans either through the issuance of 
mortgage-backed Pass Through Certificates (PTCs) or a direct 
assignment of loans. The balance is retained by HDFC Limited. 
Your Bank originated, on an average ` 3,550 crore of home loans 
every month in the year under review and purchased ` 28,205 
crore as direct assignment of loans.
Third Party Products
Your Bank distributes Life, General and Health Insurance, and 
Mutual Funds (third party products). Income from this business 
grew by 24 per cent to ` 4,422 crore from ` 3,573 crore and 
accounted for 23 per cent of Total Fee Income in the year ended 
March 31, 2022, compared with 22 per cent in the preceding year.
Life Insurance
The open architecture adopted by your Bank for insurance 
distribution with eight insurers was made more robust through 
enhancements in digital journeys and product innovation with all 
the partners. End- to-end solicitation journey for all the products 
offered is now seamlessly integrated between the Bank and 
insurance partners. More than 50 products are available for 
solicitation on HDFC Bank NetBanking platform - which now

Statutory Reports and 
Financial Statements
Corporate Banking, which focuses on large, well-rated 
companies, continued to be the biggest contributor to Wholesale 
Banking in terms of asset size. It was able to do so as it was 
armed with sufficient cash due to its strong capital base and 
balance sheet.
In Corporate banking, your Bank refocused on its engagement 
with MNCs. This business also continued to capitalise on the 
trend of large companies preferring to deal with fewer banks. 
Your Bank deepened its existing relationships as well as 
gained market share by leveraging its wide product offering. 
This business supported customer requirements under 
the Production Linked Incentive Scheme. The Emerging 
Corporates Group, which focuses on the mid- market segment, 
too witnessed significant growth. Your Bank leveraged its 
vast geographical reach, technology backbone, automated 
processes, suite of financial products and quick turnaround 
times to offer a differentiated service, which has resulted in new 
customer acquisitions as well as a higher share of the wallet from 
existing customers. The business continues to have a diversified 
portfolio in terms of both industry and geography.
In the year under review, the Bank continued its focus on the 
MSME sector. There has already been increased formalistion/
digitalisation of the MSME sector due to the adoption of the 
Goods and Service Tax (GST). The COVID-19 pandemic led to 
the sector experiencing substantial stress, prompting the Union 
Government to identify it for special support through various 
schemes like Moratorium, ECLGS, ECLGS Extension and COVID 
support loans. Your Bank supported its customers during this 
period by participating in the Government schemes.
The Investment Banking business further cemented its 
prominent position in the Debt Capital Markets, Equity Capital 
Markets and INR Loan Syndication. Your Bank maintained its 
position amongst the top 3 in the Bloomberg rankings of Rupee 
Bond Book Runners for FY 2021-22, with a market share of 
14.42 per cent. Your Bank is actively assisting clients in equity 
fund raising and was ranked 5th in the PRIME Database League 
Tables for IPOs and Rights Issues for FY 2021-22 for private 
sector issues against 9th for FY 2020-21. Your Bank is ranked 
2nd in the Bloomberg rankings of Syndicated INR term loans 
for FY 2021-22, with a market share of 11.32 per cent against 
ranking of 3rd for FY 2020-21.
In the Government business, your Bank sustained its focus on tax 
collections, collecting direct tax (CBDT) of Rs 4,08,869.61 crore 
and Indirect tax (CBIC+ GST) of over Rs 2,24,712.76 crore during 
FY 2021-22. It continues to enjoy a pre-eminent position among 
the country’s major stock and commodity exchanges in both 
Cash Management Services and Cash Settlement Services.
Your Bank has been a pioneer in providing Digital Banking 
Services to its wholesale banking customers. It was an early 
current setup in metros. In the year under review, the business 
has expanded to 67 new locations and is now catering to 216 
cities with 46 per cent increase in total families managed and total 
Assets under management of Rs. 4.11 lakh crores. Your bank 
is on track to reach 800+ locations by the end of this financial 
year through a hub and spoke model. Your bank is currently 
ranked 2nd amongst distributors in terms of distributor managed 
Mutual Fund Assets under management with market share of 4 
per cent. The business has been ranked No. 1 in Mass Affluent 
(US$100K to US$5m) Category by Euromoney Private Banking 
& Wealth Management Survey 2022 in addition to receiving 
prestigious awards like Best Private Bank in India by Global 
Private Banking Awards 2021 and Best Bank for Succession 
Planning by Asiamoney Asia Private Banking Awards 2021.
Our dedicated service team for Wealth Clients ensures that 
we deliver on our Service First philosophy. Further, to ensure 
transition from transactional approach of wealth management to 
client centric portfolio management approach, your bank tracks 
the Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) of its Wealth business 
as a key metric of client retention. Your bank has an open 
architecture framework across investment products to ensure 
that the recommended investment options are based on robust 
quantitative and qualitative evaluation model re-accentuating 
our customer centricity. Your bank is developing a mobile first 
Wealth application that will leverage on advanced analytics and 
intuitive client experience/ journeys to provide differentiated 
wealth solutions across customer segments. The digital platform 
will focus on agile digital journeys and personalisation to cater 
to customers across the country. The goal is to deliver a highly 
personalised experience that democratises wealth management 
and makes it accessible for all our customers.
Wholesale Banking
The Wholesale Banking business was a key growth engine for 
your Bank in the year under review. This business focuses on 
institutional customers such as the Government, PSUs, large and 
emerging corporates, and SMEs. Your Bank’s strong offerings 
include working capital and term loans, as well as trade credit, 
cash management, supply chain financing, foreign exchange, 
and investment banking services.
The Wholesale Banking business recorded healthy growth, 
ending FY 2021-22 with a domestic loan book size of ` 737,896 
crore, recording a growth of 26.4 per cent over the year earlier. 
This constituted about 55 per cent of your Bank’s domestic 
loans as per Basel II classification. Your Bank was able to 
expand its share of the customer wallet, primarily using sharper 
customisation, cross-selling and expanding into greater 
geographies. And continuing to lend during the pandemic while 
being prudent.

Directors’ Report
adopter of digital technology through the Corporate Net Banking 
Platform, ENet. It has now launched an upgraded Corporate 
Internet Banking Platform CBX which offers a better UI/UX and 
richer dashboard. New customers will be onboarded on this and 
existing customers will be migrated to this platform.
The bank has introduced a unique Supply Chain digital platform 
that allows its corporate clients and their supply chain network 
consisting of dealers, vendors, and corporate customers to 
connect seamlessly with the bank’s system. The platform is 
designed to provide a convenient, easy to use and efficient 
interface across all supply chain products for all members of 
the supply chain thus enhancing customer experience. 
Your Bank offers the entire gamut of financial services, such as 
payments, collection, tax solutions, Government business, trade 
finance services, cash management solutions and corporate 
cards through its flagship platform, besides seamlessly 
connecting its customers through API, S2S (Server to Server) 
and Host-to-Host services.
Treasury
The Treasury is the custodian of your Bank’s cash/liquid assets 
and handles its investments in securities, foreign exchange 
and cash instruments. It manages the liquidity and interest rate 
risks on the balance sheet and is also responsible for meeting 
reserve requirements. The vertical also helps manage the 
treasury needs of customers and earns a fee income generated 
from transactions customers undertake with your Bank while 
managing their foreign exchange and interest rate risks.
Revenue accrues from spreads on customer transactions based 
on trade and remittance flows and demonstrated hedging needs. 
Your Bank recorded revenue of ` 3,907.9 crore from foreign 
exchange and derivative transactions in the year under review. 
While plain vanilla forex products were in demand across all 
customer segments, demand for derivatives products increased 
with the RBI liberalizing regulations and allowing Indian banks to 
participate in Non-Deliverable Offshore markets.
As part of its prudent risk management, your Bank enters into 
foreign exchange and derivatives deals with counterparties after 
it has set up appropriate credit limits based on its evaluation of 
the ability of the counterparty to meet its obligations. Where 
your Bank enters into foreign currency derivatives contracts 
not involving the Indian Rupee with its customers, it typically 
lays them off in the inter-bank market on a matched basis. For 
such foreign currency derivatives, your Bank primarily carries 
the counterparty credit risk (where the customer has crystallised 
payables or mark-to-market losses) and may carry only residual 
market risk, if any. Your Bank also deals in derivatives on its own 
account, including for the purpose of its own Balance Sheet 
risk management.
Your Bank maintains a portfolio of Government Securities in 
line with the regulatory norms governing the Statutory Liquidity 
Ratio (SLR). A significant portion of these SLR securities are in 
‘Held-to- Maturity’ (HTM) category, while some are ‘Available for 
Sale’ (AFS). Your Bank is also a primary dealer for Government 
Securities. As a part of this business, your Bank holds fixed 
income securities as ‘Held for Trading’ (HFT).
In the year under review, your Bank continued to be a significant 
participant in the domestic exchange and interest rate markets. It 
also capitalised on falling bond yields to book profits and is now 
looking at tapping opportunities arising out of the liberalisation 
in the foreign exchange and interest rate markets.
B) International Business
During the year, your Bank stayed on course to cater to NRI 
clients and deepen its product and service proposition. Your 
Bank has global footprints by way of representative offices and 
branches in countries like Bahrain, Hong Kong, the UAE and 
Kenya. It also has a presence in International Financial Service 
Centre (IFSC) at GIFT City in Gandhinagar, Gujarat. 
The Bank’s product strategy in International Markets is customer 
centric and it has products to cater to client needs across asset 
classes. Your Bank now has plans to extend the product offering 
from GIFT City Branch under Liberalized Remittance Scheme to 
Resident and Non Resident clients.
As on March 31, 2022, the Balance Sheet size of International 
Business was US$ 7.66 billion. Advances constituted 3.12% of 
the Bank’s gross advances. The Total Income contributed by 
Overseas Branches constituted 0.55% of Bank’s Total Income 
for the year.

D) Semi-Urban and Rural
The Semi-urban and Rural markets have always been a focus of 
your Bank’s strategy. In the last few years, your Bank has made 
a renewed push into the Semi-urban and rural markets as rising 
income levels and aspirations of rural customers are leading to 
demand for better quality financial products and services. The 
rural groups in every department of your Bank work together to 
tap these opportunities.
Apart from meeting its statutory obligations under PSL (Agri & 
Allied activities, Small and Marginal Farmers and weaker sections 
etc), your Bank has been offering a wide range of products on 
the asset side, such as auto, two-wheeler, personal, gold, Light 
Commercial Vehicle (LCV), small shopkeeper loans in these 
markets. Now it plans to increase its coverage of villages and 
deepen relationships in existing ones. The semi-urban and rural 
push has been backed by the Bank’s digital strategy.

explained below:
Agriculture and Allied Activities
Your Bank’s assets in Agriculture & Allied activities stood at 
`134,487.50 crore as on March 31, 2022.
In general, the key to your Bank’s success in the existing market 
is its ability to tap the opportunities through:
Wide product range
Faster turnaround time
Digital solutions
The Bank’s product range includes pre-and post-harvest 
crop loans, farm development/investment loans, two- wheeler 
loans, auto loans, tractor loans, small agri business loans, loan 
against gold, among others. This has helped the Bank establish 
a strong footprint in the rural hinterland with its asset products. 
Apart from advising farmers on their financial needs, your Bank 
is increasingly focusing on facilitating various Government/
Regulatory schemes and non-crop segment covering agri allied 
and small agri business enterprises including rural MSMEs.
Your Bank has designed a range of crop and geographyspecific products in line with the harvest cycles and the local 
needs of farmers across diverse Agro-climatic zones. It has 
transformed rural banking services from being product centric 
to customer centric.
Products such as post-harvest cash credit and warehouse 
receipt financing enable faster cash flows to farmers. Credit 
is also offered for allied agricultural activities such as dairy, 
pisciculture, and sericulture.
Participation in Government Schemes
As a part of Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan, to give a fillip to the 
Indian economy and to make every Indian citizen self-reliant, the 
Government of India has announced several schemes/enablers 
across several sectors, more particularly in the agriculture sector.
Your Bank is implementing almost all such initiatives/schemes 
targeting multiple stakeholders of the agri ecosystem.
Agricultural Infrastructure Fund (AIF) Scheme: Through 
this scheme the Bank is offering medium to long-term debt 
facility for investment in viable projects pertaining to post harvest 
management, infrastructure development such as construction 
of warehouses/silos.
Your Bank has actively participated in agri infrastructure 
campaigns conducted by PMU, AIF (Ministry of Agriculture) and 
stood #1 amongst private sector Banks. As on March 31, your 
Bank has sanctioned ` 427 crore covering 298 projects.
Farmer Produce Organisations (FPOs): Leveraging the 
Government scheme for formation and promotion of 10k new 
FPOs (Credit guarantee is available from SFAC/NABARD), your 
Bank is funding eligible FPOs for working capital and term loan 
requirements. Through this initiative, your Bank will be able to 
reach a larger number of small and marginal farmers.
Pradhan Mantri Formalisation of Food and Micro 
Enterprises (PMFME): Your Bank is actively implementing the 
scheme and passing the benefits to all eligible borrowers in the 
food processing sector.
Other Agri schemes include Agri Marketing Infrastructure Fund, 
Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Fund, Pradhan Mantri Kisan 
Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan (PMKUSUM), Mission 
for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) as well as 
state specific Government schemes.
Your Bank’s focus in the rural markets has not just been on 
increasing credit offtake, but also on cementing relationships 

Directors’ Report
with customers by empowering them. As part of these efforts, 
farmer centres or Kisan Dhan Vikas Kendras have been rolled 
out in Punjab, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. 
At these centres, farmers access information on soil health, 
mandi prices, and various Government initiatives and also receive 
expert advice. Moreover, these services are also available on 
the Bank’s website in vernacular languages. Kisan Dhan Vikas 
e-Kendra is one of its kind in the Banking Industry to reach out 
to farmers as a one-stop solution for all their requirements viz. 
loan eligibility, online application facility, training though kiosks, 
call an expert facility, soil testing and much more. Your Bank 
also provides advisory on weather, cropping and harvesting 
through SMS.
In line with this, the Bank also launched the e-KISAN Dhan 
app, a unique digital app for the rural/farming community. 
This is an exclusive mobile app for all rural banking and agriculture 
information needs from HDFC Bank.
This app aggregates crucial information required by the farmers. 
There have been about 100,000 downloads of the app.
Multiple needs of the farmers can be serviced such as purchase 
of agri inputs, agro products, information on best practices, 
weather alerts, mandi rates, expert advice, agri news, information 
on Government schemes like debt waiver, interest subvention, 
crop insurance and livestock centre amongst others.
Digital Interventions
Digitising Milk Procurement: This initiative brings 
transparency in the milk procurement and payment process, 
which benefits both farmers and dairy societies. Multi-function 
Terminals (MFTs), popularly known as Milk-to- Money ATMs, are 
deployed in dairy societies. The MFTs link the milk procurement 
system of the dairy society to the farmer’s account to enable 
faster payments. MFTs have cash dispensers that function as 
standard ATMs. Payments are credited without the hassles of 
cash distribution. Further, this process creates a credit history 
which can then be used for accessing bank credit. Apart from 
dairy and cattle loans, customers gain access to all the Bank’s 
products including digital offerings such as 10 Second Personal 
Loans, Kisan Credit Card, Bill Pay, and Missed Call Mobile 
Recharge. So far, your Bank has digitised payments at over 
1,700 milk cooperatives across 21 states, benefiting more than 
5.2 lakh dairy farmers. The Dairy business witnessed 73% per 
cent year-on-year growth in disbursements and 61% in the book.
Substituting Moneylenders:
The bank is making inroads into a market dominated by 
the unorganised sector, moneylenders and pawn brokers. 
The bank is keen on making the gold loan facility available across 
the length and breadth of the country. In FY 2021-22 your bank 
made gold loans available in 351 more branches taking the 
total number of branches where it can be availed of to 1,362. 
The bank has ended the year with a porfolio of ` 8,367 crore. 
The bank is implementing its blueprint for gold loans being made 
available in every branch of the country. The Bank is also 
planning strategically to partner with channels who have the 
solutions available to increase the reach. 
Social initiatives in Farm Sector
Farm yield and income are subject to the vagaries of the 
weather. In addition, factors like soil health, input quality (seeds 
and fertilizers), water availability, and Government policy have 
significant impact, along with price realisations and storage 
facilities. Your Bank has launched a variety of initiatives to ease 
the stress on farm income and rural households.
Over the last few years, several parts of the country have 
been severely impacted by natural calamities such as drought, 
unseasonal rains, hailstorms, floods and the pandemic. Within 
regulatory guidelines, your Bank has been providing relief to the 
impacted farmers. It also has put in place systems designed to 
enable direct benefit transfers in a time-bound manner.
Lending to the agriculture sector, including to small and marginal 
farmers, is a regulatory mandate as part of priority sector lending 
requirements. The Bank has leveraged its extensive knowledge 
of rural customers to create as well as deliver products and 
services at affordable price points and with quick turnaround 
time. This has enabled the Bank to establish a strong footprint 
in the rural geographies, which it has now leveraged to increase 
its penetration of liability products. Further, your Bank is building 
a segment-specific approach like funding to horticulture clusters, 
supply chain finance, agri business, MSMEs and dairy farmers. 
It also continues to engage closely with farmers to mitigate risks 
and protect portfolio quality.
Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME)
The MSME sector serves as an important engine for economic 
growth and is one of the largest employers in the economy. Your 
Bank’s assets in the MSME segment stood at ` 313,919.49 crore 
as on March 31, 2022. Its Micro Enterprises assets alone stood 
at ` 112,564.77 crore as on March 31, 2022.
The MSME sector was one of the sectors identified for special 
support by the Government and the RBI during the pandemic 
through various schemes like Interest Moratorium, ECLGS. 
ECLGS extension, COVID support loans etc.
Your Bank has ensured support for its customers through 
ECLGS and ECLGS extension schemes during the year and has 
also supported the customers through ad hoc enhancements 
as needed by them. Your Bank emerged as a star performer 
under the ECLGS 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and ECLGS extension schemes. 
It disbursed loans amounting to ` 17,100.89 crore to over 0.78

lakh customers in all ELGS schemes. This swift support enabled 
existing customers to meet their operational liabilities and helped 
in the smooth functioning of their businesses.
The silver lining has been that the pace of digitalisation among 
MSMEs has gained further momentum. This will not only help 
the pace of disbursement but also increase transparency in the 
sector. The process started with the Government’s digitalisation 
push and the adoption of GST, which resulted in easy availability 
of data for banks regarding cash flows of these companies. It 
has been further expanded to enable customers to apply online 
by submitting requisite documents online and post sanction 
disbursement execution in digital way.
The SME portal continues to offer ad hoc approvals, preapproved TODs on an STP basis to existing customers. They 
can request top-up of loans and submit the required documents 
online. The SME portal also helps customers access your 
Bank’s services related to sanctioned credit facilities 24/7 
from anywhere.
On the trade side, your Bank’s focus has been on customer 
engagement for increasing the penetration of Trade on Net 
applications. This is a complete enterprise trade solution for 
customers engaged in domestic as well as foreign trade, enabling 
them to initiate online requests and track them seamlessly, 
resulting in reduced time and costs.
Taking Banking to the Unbanked
Your Bank is fully committed to taking banking to the remotest 
parts of the country through a combination of an extensive 
physical network and a robust digital suite of products and 
services. Today, about half of your Bank’s outlets are located 
in rural and semi-urban areas. Your Bank also offers last mile 
access through mobile applications such as BHIM, UPI, USSD, 
Scan and Pay, and RuPay enabled Micro-ATMs.
To bring more under-banked sections of the population into 
formal financial channels, your Bank has opened over 26.02 lakh 
accounts under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) 
and enrolled 38.58 lakh customers in social security schemes 
since inception. We now rank among the leading private sector 
banks in this regard. In the year under review, loans to the tune 
of ` 7,028 crore to 12.76 lakh beneficiaries were extended under 
the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) and nearly ` 216 
crore to 1,014 beneficiaries under the ‘Stand up India’ scheme 
to Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe and women borrowers. 
Your Bank also has actively supported PM Street Vendor’s 
AtmaNirbhar Nidhi (PMSVANIDHI) a special scheme under microcredit facility for street vendors with a collateral free affordable 
term loan of ` 10,000 for 1 year. Your Bank has disbursed 
` 10,000 each to 16,286 street vendors to support them during 
the pandemic and has also educated the street vendors in using 
the digital mode for making financial transactions.

Information Technology 
Summary
The Bank has accelerated the Technology and Digital 
Transformation with a continued focus on creating a seamless 
digital experience for customers. RBI, through its order dated 
December 2, 2020, advised your Bank to immediately (i) stop 
sourcing of new credit card customers and (ii) stop all launches 
of digital business generating activities planned under program 
Digital 2.0. RBI lifted the restrictions on new credit card 
acquisitions in August 2021 followed by the removal of the 
embargo on the Digital 2.0 program in March 2022. The Bank 
is fully geared to launch the next wave of strategic technology 
& digital programs which will pave the way for new customer 
journeys and best-in-class products and services through

Your Bank has taken multiple steps to ensure that its robust, 
scalable and secure technology set-up is strengthened even 
further. The Bank continues to rigorously monitor the progress 
against commitments to the regulator.
To this effect, significant strides were taken in the following 
technology areas:
Implementation of a landing zone for Hyperscalers
Your Bank has invested in a hybrid-cloud approach with the 
leading cloud service partners i.e, AWS, Azure and GCP. A 
common landing zone has been implemented across these 
partners to create a secure and streamlined environment for all 
cloud deployments in the future. The landing zone also enables 
the Bank’s agenda of imbibing agility and DevSecOps in the 
technology and digital transformation journey.
Capacity Upgrades
The capacity management program has made significant 
inroads to ensure capacity planning and management are 
commensurate with the rapid business growth witnessed by 
the Bank. Strengthening of capacity management practices 
has culminated into a threshold of 70 per cent across key 
parameters such as user concurrency, utilisation of database, 
server, storage, network and security devices. This has resulted 
in planned capacity upgrades of critical applications such as:
90,000 concurrent users capacity for using NetBanking 
and MobileBanking.
The foundations of the banking platform being upgraded 
along with modernisation of 300+ services. This enhances 
the Bank’s scalability and capacity to cater to triple the 
load of UPI transactions. Successfully managing over 
45 crore bank customer transactions per month which 
had doubled in the last 12 months. Your Bank has already 
been ranked among the top players as published in NPCI’s 
UPI performance metrics dashboard. Overall, the Bank’s 
average customer uptime was 99.94 per cent.
The senior management and the Board continue to keep strong 
focus on capacity, performance, scalability and availability of the 
Bank’s critical applications.
DR and Resiliency
The Bank has notably intensified the rigour in its DR drills 
for critical applications and will continue to further work on 
strengthening its DR processes and capabilities as outlined and 
communicated in its periodic submissions. The pivotal enablers 
in this journey are:
A rigorous focus on reducing RTO for key applications 
to 40-60 minutes, which has been completed for 56 
key applications
Deep automation to improve configuration drift management 
between primary and DR sites
Enrichment of existing automation tools for DR to cover all 
DR scenarios and reduce the RTO time further
Refactoring key applications into an ‘Hot DR’ / ‘ActiveActive’ design
Migration of the Primary Data Centre
Your Bank embarked on a journey to fully migrate and consolidate 
its primary data centre to state-of-the-art facilities in Mumbai 
and Bengaluru partnering with Sify and NTT. A systematic plan 
helped achieve 100 per cent migration of production applications 
in November 2021 followed by 100 per cent migration of UAT 
applications in March 2022. Further, a phase-wise plan is in 
place to migrate the Bank’s Chandivali, Mumbai data centre to 
the NTT facility over the next 6 months.

pertaining to high-risk applications by June 2022. The Bank 
continues to maintain rigorous monitoring on obsolescence 
through periodic reviews and reporting along with the 
senior management.
Cyber Security
Cyber security is at the heart of the technology transformation 
journey with substantial advancements being made to further 
fortify the Bank’s infrastructure and applications. A few initiatives 
in this regard are:
Foundation of a next-gen Security Operations Centre 
(SOC) with advanced technologies for predictive security 
and incident management - To this effect, the Bank 
has provisioned the Securonix platform on AWS and 
configured more than 10,000 logging sources and devices 
for monitoring

network to allow higher visibility across network flows as 
well as stronger preparedness and management against 
ransomware related events/incidents
24x7 defacement monitoring and vulnerability management 
of the Bank’s internet properties minimise the surface area 
for cyber security attacks.
Technology related challenges over the past few years have 
only made the Bank’s resolve stronger to consolidate and fortify 
its technology environment. Focused technology and digital 
investments and programs in technology are pivotal to the Bank 
to usher in the new age of digital banking and experiences for 
its customers.
Service Quality Initiatives and Grievance Redressal
Customer Focus is one of the five core values of your Bank. 
Driven by this core value, your Bank has always endeavoured 
to improve customer experience and has adopted a holistic 
approach for the same across multiple channels. This is critical 
in a highly competitive business environment, especially since 
it has various lines of businesses. Ensuring product quality and 
service delivery becomes vital for business growth. Your Bank 
desires to achieve this by seeking customer feedback as well 
as benchmarking with best-in-class business entities. Your bank 
has adopted a three-step strategy with regards to Customer 
Service - Define, Measure, and Improve.
Your Bank has adopted a multi-pronged approach to provide 
an omnichannel experience to its customers. On one side, your 
Bank has traditional touch points like Branch, Email Management 
team and Phone banking, and on the other side, it has state- ofthe-art platforms like NetBankinbg, MobileBanking, the chatbot 
Eva and the bank’s exclusive social care handles which offer a 
wide range of channel choice to its customers. Your Bank has 
also improvised on the relationship-based banking programmes. 
In addition to the branch-based relationship managers, it also 
has a Virtual Relationship Manager (VRM) programme to cater 
to various financial needs in a personalized manner. Your Bank 
invites and reviews the performance on customer service as well 
as grievance redressal at different levels which are Branch Level 
Customer Service Committees (BLCSCs), Standing Committee 
on Customer Service (SCCS) and Customer Service Committee 
of the Board (CSCB). Your Bank has put robust processes in 
place to regularly monitor and measure quality of service levels 
not only at various touch points but also at a product and 
process level by Quality Initiatives Group.
As part of its continuous efforts to enhance quality of service, the 
Service Quality team carries out regular reviews across various 
products/processes/channels. The effectiveness of the quality 
of service provided is also reviewed at different levels, including 
the Customer Service Committee of the Board.
One of the basic building blocks of providing acceptable level 
of customer service is to have an effective internal Grievance 
Redressal mechanism / framework. In this regard, the bank has 
outlined a framework for redressal of customer grievances and 
documented it in the form of a Grievance Redressal Policy – duly 
approved by its Board. Bank has also made this policy available 
in public domain (on the website as well as in the branches). 
Your Bank has provided multiple channels to its customers 
to share feedback on its services as well as register their 
grievances. Your Bank is at the forefront of developing innovative 
financial solutions and digital platforms. This, coupled with 
concerted efforts at creating awareness among customers, 
has led to an increase in the use of its digital channels as well 

Directors’ Report
as customer loyalty. Keeping customer interest in focus, your 
Bank has formulated a Board approved Protection Policy, which 
limits the liability of customers in case of unauthorized electronic 
banking transactions
Your Bank is on a journey to measure customer loyalty through 
a high velocity, closed loop customer feedback system. This 
customer experience transformation programme will help 
employees empathize better with customers and improve 
turnaround times. Branded as ‘Infinite Smiles’, the programme 
would help establish behaviours and practices that result in 
customer-centric actions through continuous improvements in 
product, services, process, and policies.
Thanks to these initiatives, your Bank’s customer complaints for 
FY 21-22 decreased by 21 percent from 4,67,453* to 3,68,291. 
*Restated complaints number based on reclassification of 
queries into complaints from 3,25,786.
Risk Management and Portfolio Quality
Risk Management and Portfolio Quality
Traditionally, the key risks that your Bank is exposed to in the 
course of its business have been the Pillar 1 risks - Credit Risk, 
Market Risk and Operational Risk. Given the evolving banking 
environment, Liquidity Risk, Information Technology Risk and 
Information Security Risk have also become vital. These risks 
not only have a bearing on your Bank’s financial strength and 
operations but also on its reputation. Keeping this in mind, 
the Bank has put in place Board-approved risk strategy and 
policies, whose implementation is supervised by the Risk Policy 
and Monitoring Committee (RPMC). The Committee ensures 
that frameworks are established for assessing and managing 
various risks faced by your Bank, systems are developed to 
relate risk to the Bank’s capital level and methods are in place for 
monitoring compliance with internal risk management policies 
and processes. The Committee guides the development 
of policies, procedures and systems for managing risks. It 
ensures that these are adequate and appropriate to changing 
business conditions, the structure and needs of your Bank and 
its risk appetite.
The hallmark of your Bank’s risk management function is that it 
is independent of the business sourcing unit with convergence 
only at the CEO level.
The gamut of key risks faced by the Bank which are dimensioned 
and managed include:
Credit Risk, including Residual Risks
Market Risk
Operational Risk
Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book
Liquidity Risk
Intraday Liquidity Risk
Intra Day Credit Risk
Credit Concentration Risk
Counterparty Credit Risk
Model Risk
Outsourcing Risk
People Risk
Business Risk
Strategic Risk
Compliance Risk
Reputation Risk
Technology Risk
Group Risk
Credit Risk
Credit Risk is defined as the possibility of losses associated with 
diminution in the credit quality of borrowers or counterparties. 
Losses stem from outright default or reduction in portfolio 
value. Your Bank has a distinct credit risk architecture, 
policies, procedures and systems for managing credit risk in 
both its retail and wholesale businesses. Wholesale lending is 
managed on an individual as well as portfolio basis. In contrast, 
retail lending, given the granularity of individual exposures, is 
managed largely on a portfolio basis across various products 
and customer segments. For both categories, there are robust 
front-end and back-end systems in place to ensure credit quality 
and to minimise loss from default. The factors considered while 
sanctioning retail loans include income, demographics, credit 
history, loan tenor and banking behaviour. In addition, there are 
multiple credit risk models developed and used to appraise and 
score different segments of customers on the basis of portfolio 
behaviour. In wholesale loans, credit risk is managed by capping 
exposures on the basis of borrower group, industry, credit rating 
grades and country, among others. This is backed by portfolio 
diversification, stringent credit approval processes and periodic 
post-disbursement monitoring and remedial measures. Your 
Bank has been able to ensure strong asset quality through 
volatile times in the lending environment by stringently adhering 
to prudent norms and institutionalised processes. Your Bank 
also has a robust framework for assessing Counterparty Banks, 
which are reviewed periodically to ensure interbank exposures 
are within approved appetite.

As on March 31, 2022, your Bank’s ratio of Gross Non Performing 
Assets (GNPAs) to Gross Advances was 1.17 per cent. Net Nonperforming Assets (Gross Non-Performing Assets Less Specific 
Loan Loss provisions) was 0.32 per cent of Net Advances.
Your Bank has a conservative and prudent policy for specific 
provisions on NPAs. Its provision for NPAs is higher than the 
minimum regulatory requirements and adheres to the regulatory 
norms for Standard Assets.
Digital and Credit Risk 
Driven by rapid advancements in technology, digitalisation is 
increasingly becoming a key differentiator for customer retention 
and service delivery in the banking sector. Digital lending enables 
customers to secure loans at the click of a button in a matter of 
minutes, if not seconds. However, there are also attendant risks 
associated with it and your Bank has put in place appropriate 
checks and balances to manage these risks. Such loans are 
sanctioned primarily to your Bank’s existing customers. Often, 
they are customers across multiple products, thus enabling the 
Bank ready access to their credit history and risk profile. This 
facilitates evaluation on their loan eligibility. Besides, most of the 
credit checks and scores used by your Bank in process- based 
underwriting are replicated for digital loans. The Bank has an 
independent model validation unit that minutely assesses the 
models used to generate the credit scores for such loans. These 
models are monitored, reviewed periodically, back tested and 
corrective action is taken whenever needed.
Market Risk
Market Risk arises largely from your Bank’s statutory reserve 
management and trading activity in interest rates, equity and 
currency market. These risks are managed through a welldefined Board approved Market Risk Policy, Investment Policy, 
Foreign Exchange Trading Policy and Derivatives Policy that 
caps risk in different trading desks or various securities through 
trading risk limits/triggers. The risk measures include position 
limits, tenor restrictions, sensitivity limits, namely, PV01, Modified 
Duration of Hold to Maturity Portfolio and Option Greeks, Valueat-Risk (VaR) Limit, Stop Loss Trigger Level (SLTL), Scenario 
based P&L Triggers, Potential Loss Trigger Level (PLTL), and 
are monitored on an end-of-day basis. In addition, forex open 
positions, currency option delta and interest rate sensitivity 
limits are computed and monitored on an intraday basis. This 
is supplemented by a Board-approved stress testing policy 
and framework that simulates various market risk scenarios 
to measure losses and initiate remedial measures. The Market 
Risk capital charge of your Bank is computed on a daily basis 
using the Standardised Measurement Method applying the 
regulatory factors.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank may not be able to 
meet its financial obligations as they fall due without incurring 
unacceptable losses. Your Bank’s framework for liquidity and 
interest rate risk management is spelt out through a well-defined 
Board approved Asset Liability Management Policy. As part of 
this process, your Bank has established various Board-approved 
limits, both for liquidity risk and interest rate risk in banking book. 
Implementation of the policy, monitoring of limits is reviewed by 
the Asset Liability Committee (ALCO). While the maturity gap, 
Basel III ratios and stock ratio limits help manage liquidity risk, 
Net Interest Income and market value impacts help mitigate 
interest rate risk. This is reinforced by a comprehensive Boardapproved stress testing programme covering both liquidity and 
interest rate risk.
Your Bank conducts various studies to assess the behavioural 
pattern of non-contractual assets and liabilities and embedded 
options available to customers, which are used while managing 
maturity gaps and repricing risk. Further, your Bank also has the 
necessary framework in place to manage intraday liquidity risk.
The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), a global standard, is also 
used to measure your Bank’s liquidity position. LCR seeks to 
ensure that the Bank has an adequate stock of unencumbered 
High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) that can be converted into 
cash easily and immediately to meet its liquidity needs under 
a 30-day calendar liquidity stress scenario. Based on Basel III 
norms, your Bank’s average LCR stood at 121.16 per cent on 
a consolidated basis for FY 2021-22 as against the regulatory 
threshold at 100 per cent.
Average Liquidity Coverage Ratio
121.16 per cent
on a consolidated basis for FY 2021-22
The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), a key liquidity risk measure 
under BCBS liquidity standards, is also used to measure your 
Bank’s liquidity position. The NSFR seeks to ensure that 
your Bank maintains a stable funding profile in relation to the 
composition of its assets and off-balance sheet activities. The 
RBI guidelines stipulated a minimum NSFR requirement of 100 
per cent at a consolidated level with effect from October 1, 2021. 
Your Bank has maintained the NSFR well above 100 per cent 
since its implementation. Based on guidelines issued by RBI, 
your Bank’s NSFR stood at 124.00 per cent on a consolidated

Operational Risk
This is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal 
processes, people and systems or from external events. It also 
includes risk of loss due to legal risk.

Directors’ Report
Given below is a detailed explanation under four different 
heads: Framework and Process, Internal Control, Information 
Technology and Security Practices and Fraud Monitoring 
and Control.
Framework and Process 
To manage Operational Risks, your Bank has in place a 
comprehensive Operational Risk Management Framework, 
whose implementation is supervised by the Operational Risk 
Management Committee (ORMC) and reviewed by the RPMC 
of the Board. An independent Operational Risk Management 
Department (ORMD) implements the framework. Under the 
framework, the Bank has three lines of defence. The first line of 
defence is the business line (including support and operations).
The first line is primarily responsible for developing risk mitigation 
strategies in managing operational risk for their respective units.
The second line of defence is the ORMD, which is responsible 
for implementing the operational risk management framework 
across the Bank. It designs and develops tools required for 
implementing the framework including policies and processes, 
guidelines towards implementation and maintenance of the 
framework. In order to achieve the aforesaid objective pertaining 
to operational risk management framework, the ORMC guides 
and oversees the functioning, implementation and maintenance 
of operational risk management activities of Bank, with special 
focus on:
Identification and assessment of risks across the Bank 
through the Risk and Control Self-Assessment (RCSA) and 
Scenario analysis
Measurement of Operational Risk based on the actual 
loss data
Monitoring of risk through Key Risk Indicators (KRI)
Management and reporting through KRI, RCSA and loss 
data of the Bank
Internal Audit is the third line of defence. The team reviews the 
effectiveness of governance, risk management and internal 
controls within your Bank.
Internal Control
Your Bank has implemented sound internal control practices 
across all processes, units and functions. It has well laid down 
policies and processes for the management of its day-today activities. Your Bank follows established, well-designed 
controls, which include traditional four eye principles, effective 
segregation of business and support functions, segregation of 
duties, call back processes, reconciliation, exception reporting 
and periodic MIS. Specialised risk control units function in riskprone products/ functions to minimise operational risk. Controls 
are tested as part of the SOX control testing framework.
Information Technology and Information 
Security Practices
Your Bank operates in a highly automated environment and 
makes use of the latest technologies available on cloud or on 
Premises Data centres to support various business segments. 
This results in various risks such as those associated with the 
use, ownership, operation, involvement, influence, and adoption 
of IT within an enterprise, as well as business disruption due 
to technological failures. Additionally, it can lead to risks 
related to information assets, data security, integrity, reliability 
and availability, among others. Your Bank has put in place a 
governance framework, information security practices and 
business continuity plan to mitigate Information Technology & 
Information Security-related risks.
The three lines of defence approach is adopted for enterprisewide Technology Risk management. The first line of defence 
holds primary responsibility of managing the risk and ensuring 
proper controls are in place.
The second line of defence defines policies, frameworks and 
controls. Information Technology Risk and Information Security 
Group addresses technology and information security related 
risks. A well-documented Board-approved information security 
policy and cyber security policy are in place. Your Bank has a 
robust Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery plan that is 
periodically tested to ensure that it can meet any operational 
contingencies. Further, there is a well-documented crisis 
management plan in place to address the strategic issues of 
a crisis impacting the Bank and to direct and communicate 
the corporate response to the crisis including cyber crisis. In 
addition, employees mandatorily and periodically undergo 
information security training and sensitisation exercises.
For details on robust cyber security measures please refer page 
no. 51. 
An independent assurance team within Internal Audit acts as a 
third line of defence that provides assurance on the management 
of IT-related risks.
Fraud Monitoring and Control 
Your Bank has put in place a Whistle Blower and Vigilance Policy 
and a central vigilance team that oversees the implementation 
of fraud prevention measures. Frauds are investigated to 
identify the root cause and relevant corrective steps are taken 
to prevent recurrence.
Fraud Monitoring committees at the senior management and 
Board level also deliberate on material fraud events and advise

preventive actions. Periodic reports are submitted to the Board 
and senior management committees.
Compliance Risk
Compliance Risk is defined as the risk of impairment of your 
Bank’s integrity, leading to damage to its reputation, legal or 
regulatory sanctions, or financial loss, as a result of a failure (or 
perceived failure) to comply with applicable laws, regulations 
and standards. Your Bank has a Compliance Policy to ensure 
the highest standards of compliance. A dedicated team of 
subject matter experts in the Compliance Department works 
with business, support and operations teams to ensure active 
Compliance Risk management and monitoring. The team also 
provides advisory services on regulatory matters. The focus is on 
identifying and reducing risk by rigorously testing products and 
also putting in place robust internal policies. Products that adhere 
to regulatory norms are tested after rollout and shortcomings, 
if any, are fully addressed till the product stabilises on its own. 
Internal policies are reviewed and updated periodically as per 
agreed frequency or based on market actions or regulatory 
guidelines/actions. The compliance team also seeks regular 
feedback on regulatory compliance from product, business and 
operation teams through self-certifications and monitoring.
ICAAP
Your Bank has a structured management framework in the 
Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) to 
identify, assess and manage all risks that may have a material 
adverse impact on its business/financial position/capital 
adequacy. The ICAAP framework is guided by the Board 
approved ICAAP Policy.
Stress Testing Framework
Your Bank has implemented a Board approved Stress Testing 
Policy and Framework which forms an integral part of the Bank’s 
ICAAP. Stress testing involves the use of various techniques to 
assess your Bank’s potential vulnerability to extreme but plausible 
stressed business conditions. The changes in the levels of Pillar 
I risks and select Pillar II risks, along with the changes in the 
on and off Balance Sheet positions of your Bank are assessed 
under assumed ‘stress’ scenarios and sensitivity factors. The 
suite of stress scenarios include topical themes as well as 
prevailing geopolitical / macroeconomic / sectoral and other 
trends. The stress testing outcome may be analysed through 
capital impact and/or identification of vulnerable borrowers 
depending on the scenario.
Group Risk
Your Bank has two subsidiaries, HDB Financial Services Limited 
and HDFC Securities Limited. The Board of each subsidiary is 
responsible for managing their respective material risks (Credit 
Risk, Concentration Risk, Market Risk, Operational Risk, 
Liquidity Risk, Interest Rate Risk on Banking Book, Technology 
Risk, Reputation Risk, Compliance Risk, Business Risk and 
others). The Group Risk Management Committee (GRMC) was 
instituted in your Bank under the ICAAP framework to establish a 
formal and dedicated structure to periodically assess the nature/
quantum of material risks of the subsidiaries and adequacy of 
its risk management processes. Stress testing for the group 
as a whole is carried out by integrating the stress tests of 
the subsidiaries. Similarly, capital adequacy projections are 
formulated for the group after incorporating the business/capital 
plans of the subsidiaries.
Business Continuity Planning (BCP)
Your Bank has an ISO22301:2019 certified Business Continuity 
Program in place to minimise service disruptions and potential 
impact on its employees, customers and business during any 
unforeseen adverse events or circumstances. This program 
is designed in accordance with the guidelines issued by 
regulatory bodies and is subject to regular internal, external and 
regulatory reviews. The central Business Continuity Office works 
towards strengthening the bank’s continuity preparedness. 
The implementation is overseen by the Business Continuity 
Steering Committee which is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer. 
The Business Continuity Procedure has well defined roles and 
responsibilities for Crisis Management, Business Recovery, 
Emergency Response and IT Disaster Recovery Teams. Please 
refer to page no. 52 for more details.
Some of the key aspects of thisprogram include thefollowing:
Presence of a Steering Committee for centralised monitoring 
of your Bank's Business Continuity program implementation
Presence of Crisis Management teams for effective 
management of recovery operations during disruptive events
Presence of a dedicated DR site for recovery of critical core 
and customer facing applications
Decentralised recovery plans at functional and regional 
levels for structured and speedy recovery of operations
Periodic drills are exercises for testing the effectiveness of 
these recovery plans.
These robust practices have enabled your bank to continue 
delivering banking services seamlessly to customers throughout 
the COVID-19 pandemic phases coupled with other major 
disruptive events. Your Bank has successfully emerged from 
all these difficult situations with a hybrid approach comprising 
of well-adopted continuity and recovery strategies like remote 
working (work from home), split operations, work transfer and/
or staff transfer to available sites, in accordance with prevailing 
protocols and norms.

Directors’ Report
7) Internal Controls, Audit and Compliance
Your Bank has put in place extensive internal controls and 
processes to mitigate Operational Risks, including centralised 
operations and ‘segregation of duty’ between the front office 
and back office. The front-office units usually act as customer 
touch-points and sales and service outlets while the back-office 
carries out the entire processing, accounting and settlement 
of transactions in the Bank’s core banking system. The policy 
framework, definition and monitoring of limits is carried out by 
various mid-office and risk management functions. The credit 
sanctioning and debt management units are also segregated 
and do not have any sales and operations responsibilities.
Your Bank has set up various executive-level committees, with 
participation from various business and control functions, that 
are designed to review and oversee matters pertaining to capital, 
assets and liabilities, business practices and customer service, 
Operational Risk, information security, business continuity 
planning and internal risk-based supervision among others. The 
second line of defense functions set standards and lay down 
policies and procedures by which the business functions manage 
risks, including compliance with applicable laws, compliance 
with regulatory guidelines, adherence to operational controls and 
relevant standards of conduct. At the ground level, your Bank has 
a mix of preventive and detective controls implemented through 
systems and processes, ensuring a robust framework in your 
Bank to enable correct and complete accounting, identification 
of outliers (if any) by the Management on a timely basis for 
corrective action and mitigating Operational Risks.
Your Bank has put in place various preventive controls:
(a) 
Limited and need-based access to systems by users
(b) 
Dual custody over cash and near-cash items
(c) 
Segregation of duty in processing of transactions vis-à-vis 
creation of user IDs
(d) 
Segregation of duty in processing of transactions vis-à-vis 
monitoring and review of transactions/reconciliation
(e) 
Four eye principle (maker-checker control) for processing 
of transactions
(f) 
Stringent password policy
(g) 
Booking of transactions in core banking system mandates 
the earmarking of line/limit (fund as well as non-fund based) 
assigned to the customer
(h) 
STP processes between core banking system and payment 
interface systems for transmission of messages
(i) 
Additional authorisation leg in payment interface systems 
in applicable cases
(j) 
Audit logs directly extracted from systems
(k) 
Empowerment grid
Your Bank also has detective controls in place:
(a) 
Periodic review of user IDs
(b) 
Post-transaction monitoring at the back-end by way of call 
back process (through daily log reports) by an independent 
person, i.e., to ascertain that entries in the core banking 
system/messages in payment interface systems are based 
on valid/authorised transactions and customer requests
(i) 
Daily tally of cash and near-cash items at end of day
(ii) 
Reconciliation of Nostro accounts (by an independent 
team) to ascertain and match-off the Nostro credits 
and debits (External or Internal) regularly to avoid / 
identify any unreconciled/unmatched entries passing 
through the system
(c) 
Reconciliation of all Suspense Accounts and establishment 
of responsibility in case of outstanding
(d) 
Independent and surprise checks periodically by supervisors
Your Bank has an Internal Audit Department which is responsible 
for independently evaluating the adequacy and effectiveness of 
all internal controls, risk management, governance systems and 
processes and is manned by appropriately qualified personnel.
This department adopts a risk-based audit approach and carries 
out audits across various businesses i.e. Retail, Wholesale and 
Treasury (for India and Overseas books), audit of Operations units, 
Management and Thematic audits, Information Security audit, 
Revenue audit and Concurrent audit in order to independently 
evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls on 
an ongoing basis and pro-actively recommending enhancements 
thereof. The Internal Audit Department, during the course of audit, 
also ascertains the extent of adherence to regulatory guidelines, 
legal requirements and operational processes and provides 
timely feedback to the Management for corrective actions. A 
strong oversight on the operations is also kept through off-site 
monitoring by use of data analytics to study trends/patterns to 
detect outliers (if any) and alert the Management.
The Internal Audit Department also independently reviews 
your Bank’s implementation of Internal Rating Based (IRB)- 
approach for calculation of capital charge for Credit Risk, the 
appropriateness of your Bank’s ICAAP, as well as evaluates the 
quality and comprehensiveness of your Bank’s disaster recovery 
and business continuity plans and also carries out management 
self-assessment of adequacy of the Bank’s internal financial 
controls and operating effectiveness of such controls in terms of 
Sarbanes Oxley (SOX) Act and Companies Act, 2013. The Internal 
Audit Department plays an important role in strengthening of the

Control functions by periodically reviewing their practices and 
processes as well as recommending enhancements thereof. 
Additionally, oversight is also kept on the functioning of the 
subsidiaries, related party transactions and extent of adherence 
to the licensing conditions of the RBI.
Any new product/process introduced in your Bank is reviewed by 
Compliance function in order to ensure adherence to regulatory 
guidelines and also by Internal Audit from the perspective of 
existence of internal controls. The Audit function also proactively 
recommends improvements in operational processes and 
service quality, wherever deemed fit.
To ensure independence, the Internal Audit Function has a 
reporting line to the Audit Committee of the Board and a dotted line 
reporting to the Managing Director for administrative purposes.
The Compliance function independently tracks, reviews and 
ensures compliance with regulatory guidelines and promotes a 
compliance culture in the Bank.
Your Bank has a comprehensive Know Your Customer, 
Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Combating Financing of 
Terrorism (CFT) policy (based on the RBI guidelines/provisions 
of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002) incorporating 
the key elements of Customer Acceptance Policy, Customer 
Identification Procedures, Risk Management and Monitoring of 
Transactions. The policy is subjected to an annual review and is 
duly approved by the Board.
Your Bank besides having robust controls in place to ensure 
adherence to the KYC guidelines at the time of account opening 
also has monitoring process at various stages of the customer 
lifecycle including a continuous review process in the form of 
transaction monitoring carried out by a dedicated AML CFT 
monitoring team, which carries out transaction reviews for 
identification of suspicious patterns/trends that enables your 
Bank to further carry out enhanced due diligence (wherever 
required) and appropriate actions thereafter. The status of 
adherence to the KYC, AML and CFT guidelines is also placed 
before the Audit Committee of the Board for their review at 
quarterly intervals.
The Audit team and the Compliance team undergo regular 
training both in-house and external to equip them with the 
necessary knowhow and expertise to carry out the function.
The Audit Committee of the Board reviews the effectiveness 
of controls, compliance with regulatory guidelines as also the 
performance of the Audit and Compliance functions in your Bank 
and provides direction, wherever deemed fit. Your Bank has 
always adhered to the highest standards of compliance and 
has put in place appropriate controls and risk measurement 
and risk management tools to ensure a robust compliance and 
governance structure.

Material Developments: Proposed Scheme of 
Amalgamation 
The Board of Directors of HDFC Bank Limited (‘HDFC Bank’) at 
its meeting held on April 4, 2022, approved a composite scheme 
of amalgamation (‘Scheme’) for the amalgamation of: (i) HDFC 
Investments Limited and HDFC Holdings Limited, wholly-owned 
subsidiaries of the Housing Development Finance Corporation 
Limited (‘HDFC Limited’), with and into HDFC Limited and (ii) 
HDFC Limited with and into HDFC Bank and matters related 
thereto. 
With effect from the appointed date and upon the amalgamation 
of HDFC Limited with and into HDFC Bank becoming effective, 
HDFC Limited along with all its assets, liabilities, contracts, 
employees, licenses, records and approvals being their 
respective integral parts shall stand transferred to and vest in 
or shall be deemed to have been transferred to and vested in 
HDFC Bank, as a going concern. 
Upon the Scheme becoming effective and in consideration of the 
proposed amalgamation of HDFC Limited with and into HDFC 
Bank, HDFC Limited will stand dissolved without being wound 
up and the shareholders of HDFC Limited as on the record 
date will receive 42 shares of HDFC Bank (each of face value of 
` 1), for 25 shares held in HDFC Limited (each of face value of 
` 2). This share exchange ratio has been arrived at based on a 
joint valuation report submitted by two Registered Valuers and 
independent Chartered Accountancy firms appointed by HDFC 
Bank and HDFC Limited, which was supported by a Fairness 
Opinion provided by two SEBI registered merchant bankers. 
During the period between the approval of the Scheme by the 
respective boards of HDFC Bank and HDFC Limited and up to 
the effectiveness of the Scheme, the business of HDFC Bank 
and HDFC Limited shall be carried out with reasonable diligence 
and business prudence in the ordinary course, consistent with 
past practice, in accordance with the applicable laws and as 
mutually agreed. 
The Board of Directors of HDFC Bank and HDFC Limited 
have opined that the proposed amalgamation would be in the 
best interest of the respective companies, their shareholders, 
employees, creditors and other stakeholders, since the proposed 
amalgamation will yield advantages as set out, inter alia, below: 
(a) 
the amalgamation, through the Scheme, shall enable HDFC 
Bank to build its housing loan portfolio and enhance its 
existing customer base;
(b) 
The amalgamation is based on leveraging the significant 
complementarities that exist amongst the parties to the 
Scheme. It would create meaningful value for various 
stakeholders including respective shareholders, customers, 
employees, as the combined business would benefit 
from increased scale, comprehensive product offering, 
balance sheet resiliency and the ability to drive synergies 
across revenue opportunities, operating efficiencies and 
underwriting efficiencies, amongst others; 
(c) 
HDFC Bank is a private sector bank and has a large base of 
over 6.8 Crore customers. The Bank platform will provide a 
well-diversified low cost funding base for growing the long 
tenor loan book acquired by the HDFC Bank pursuant to 
the amalgamation; 
(d) 
HDFC Bank is a banking company with a large distribution 
network that offers product offerings in the retail and 
wholesale segments. HDFC Limited is a premier housing 
finance company in India and provides housing loans to 
individuals as well as loans to corporates, undertakes lease 
rental discounting and construction finance apart from 
being a financial conglomerate. A combination of HDFC 
Limited and HDFC Bank is entirely complementary to, and 
enhances the value proposition of, HDFC Bank;
(e) 
HDFC Bank would benefit from a larger balance sheet and 
networth which would allow underwriting of larger ticket 
loans and also enable a greater flow of credit into the 
Indian economy; 
 
HDFC Limited has invested capital and developed skills 
and has set up approximately 464 (Four Hundred and Sixty 
Four) offices across the country. These offices can be used 
to sell the entire product suite of both HDFC Bank and 
HDFC Limited;
(f) 
The loan book of HDFC Limited is diversified having 
cumulatively financed over 9 million dwelling units. With 
HDFC Limited’s leadership in the home loan arena, 
developed over the past 45 years, HDFC Bank would be 
able to provide to customers flexible mortgage offerings in 
a cost-effective and efficient manner;
(g) 
HDFC Bank has access to funds at lower costs due to 
its high level of current and savings accounts deposits 
(CASA). With the amalgamation of HDFC Limited with and 
into HDFC Bank, HDFC Bank will be able to offer more 
competitive housing products; 

Directors’ Report
(h) 
HDFC Limited’s rural housing network and affordable 
housing lending is likely to qualify for HDFC Bank as priority 
sector lending and will also enable a higher flow of credit 
into priority sector lending, including agriculture; 
(i) 
the amalgamation will result in reducing HDFC Bank’s 
proportion of exposure to unsecured loans;
(j) 
HDFC Limited has built technological capabilities to 
evaluate the credit worthiness of customers using 
analytical models, and has developed unique skills in 
financing various customer segments. The models have 
been tested and refined over the years at scale and HDFC 
Bank will benefit from such expertise in underwriting and 
financing of mortgage offerings;
(k) 
HDFC Bank can leverage on the loan management 
system, comprising rule engines, IT tools and rules, agents 
connected through a central system;
(l) 
The amalgamation is expected to result in bolstering the 
capital base and bringing in resiliency in the balance sheet 
of HDFC Bank. 
(m) HDFC Investments Limited and HDFC Holdings Limited 
are Systemically Important Non - Deposit Taking Non - 
Banking Financial Companies and are also wholly owned 
subsidiaries of HDFC Limited. The proposed amalgamation 
shall result in simplified corporate structure.
The Scheme is subject to receipt of requisite approvals, including 
from statutory and regulatory authorities, as required under 
applicable laws. The scheme has been filed with BSE Limited, 
National Stock Exchange of India Limited and Reserve Bank 
of India.

Board Performance Evaluation
The performance evaluation of the Board, Committees of the 
Board and the individual members of the Board (including the 
Chairman) for FY 2021-22, was carried out internally pursuant to 
the framework laid down by the Nomination and Remuneration 
Committee (NRC). A questionnaire for the evaluation of the 
Board, its Committees and the individual members of the Board 
(including the Chairman), designed in accordance with the said 
framework and covering various aspects of the performance 
of the Board and its Committees, including composition, roles 
and responsibilities, Board processes, Boardroom culture, 
adherence to Code of Conduct and Ethics, quality and flow of 
information, as well as measurement of performance in the areas 
of strength and areas of focus, as identified in the previous year's 
evaluation, was sent out to the Directors. The Committees were 
evaluated inter alia on parameters such as composition, terms of 
reference, quality of discussions, contribution to Board decisions 
and balance of agenda between the Committee and the Board. 
The responses received to the questionnaires on evaluation of 
the Board and its Committees were placed before the meeting 
of the Independent Directors for consideration. The assessment 
of performance of Non-Independent Directors on key personal 
and professional attributes was also carried out at the meeting 
of Independent Directors. The assessment of performance of 
the Independent Directors on the Board (including Chairman) 
was subsequently discussed by the Board. In addition to the 
above parameters, the Board also evaluated fulfillment of the 
independence criteria as specified in SEBI (Listing Obligations 
and Disclosure Requirement) Regulations, 2015 by the 
Independent Directors of the Bank and their independence from 
the management. 
The evaluation brought out the cohesiveness of the Board, a 
Boardroom culture of trust and cooperation, and Boardroom 
discussions which are open, transparent and encourage diverse 
viewpoints. Other areas of strength included effective discharge 
of Board's roles and responsibilities. Some of the areas of focus 
for the Board going forward included increasing time dedicated 
to strategy- competitive positioning and benchmark, long term 
succession planning and talent management, improvement in 
Board processes and quality of information. The Board also 
noted that while there has been positive development in the 
areas of focus identified in the previous year's evaluation, efforts 
need to continue in that direction. The appropriate feedback 
was conveyed to the Board members and other concerned 
stakeholders, for suitable action.

the criteria for identification of persons who are qualified and 
‘fit and proper’ to become Directors on the Board- such as 
academic qualifications, competence, track record, integrity, etc. 
which shall be considered by the NRC while recommending 
appointment of Directors. The Policy is available on the website 
of the Bank at the link https://www.hdfcbank.com/personal/
about-us/corporate-governance/codes-and-policies.
The remuneration of all employees of the Bank, including Whole

characteristics and complexities within the Bank. The ultimate 
objective is to provide a fair and transparent structure that helps

culture based on the belief that the Performance Management 
System provides a sound basis for assessing performance 
holistically. The compensation system should also take into 
account factors such as roles, skills / competencies, experience 
and grade / seniority to differentiate pay appropriately on the 
basis of contribution, skill and availability of talent on account 
of competitive market forces. The details of the Compensation 
Policy are also included in Note No. 25 of Schedule 18 forming

and transitions at the Board and Senior Management levels. The

any, are reviewed in advance through a systematic due diligence 
process. The recent appointment on the Board of Mrs. Lily 
Vadera as an Independent Director was done taking into account 
her skill sets/areas of expertise in the banking industry.

business and assurance functions, is continuously reviewed to 
ensure continuity and depth of leadership at two levels below the

Conclusion
The year started in the shadow of the pandemic. The good news 
is that it more or less appears to be behind us. In no small 
measure due to the roll out of the vaccination programme. 
The recovery in health has been followed by clear signs of 
economic recovery with the country's GDP growing by 8.7 per 
cent in 2021-22 against a contraction of 6.6 per cent in the 
previous year. 
Headwinds have now appeared in the form of inflationary 
pressures due to a combination of supply chain disruptions 
and geopolitical tensions particularly the Ukraine crisis. In an 
effort to contain inflation the RBI has hiked the Repo Rate by 90 
basis points in two announcements - an off cycle one on May 
4 and the June Policy- to 4.90 per cent. Notwithstanding these 
challenges the Indian economy is expected to be the fastest 
growing one in the world. That is clearly good news. 
Going forward, the Bank has a huge opportunity as India is 
still under penetrated when it comes to banking services. 
Your Bank clearly has certain factors in its favour : A strong 
balance sheet with among the lowest NPA levels in the industry 
and a trusted franchise. The regulators too have been kind. 
Our progress against our regulatory commitments over the past 
year has resulted in the lifting of the restrictions placed on new 
card acquisitions in August 2021, followed by the removal of the 
embargo on the Digital 2.0 program in March 2022. The Bank 
has also rolled out the Future Ready Strategy. All this will help 
the Bank move forward in the next level of its growth journey. 
It will do this by focusing on its five core values: Customer 
Focus, Operational Excellence, Product Leadership, People and 
Sustainability. And adhere to the highest standards of corporate 
governance as we continue to ‘Lead Responsibly’.

given financial year can only be made in the subsequent financial year 
post assessment of performance for the reference financial year. For 
e.g. salary increment proposal to be made to the RBI effective April 
01, 2020 can only be made post assessment of performance for the 
financial year 2020 – 2021. The approval received from the RBI will 
therefore be retrospectively applied from April 01, 2020. Therefore, 
due to this process, the salary increase given in the particular year will 
always be reported as zero.

HDFC Bank Limited Integrated Annual Report 2021-22

Independent Auditor's Report
To the Members of HDFC Bank Limited
Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Opinion 
We have audited the standalone financial statements of HDFC Bank Limited (“the Bank”), which comprise the Balance Sheet as at 
March 31, 2022, the Profit and Loss Account, the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended, and notes to the standalone 
financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. 
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial 
statements give the information required by the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 as well as the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in the 
manner so required for Banking Companies and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Accounting Standards prescribed 
under section 133 of the Act read with Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 as amended and other accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Bank as at March 31, 2022 and its profit and its cash flows for the year ended on 
that date.
Basis for Opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. 
Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Bank in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“the ICAI”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
Key Audit Matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone 
financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2022. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone 
financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 

Independent Auditor's Report
Identification of Non-performing advances (NPA) and provisioning on advances:
Total Loans and Advances (Net of Provision) as at March 31, 2022: ` 1,368,821 Crores
Provision for NPA as at March 31, 2022: ` 11,733 Crores 
(Refer Schedule 9, Schedule 17(C)(2), Schedule 18(13))
Key Audit Matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
The Reserve Bank of India’s (“RBI”) guidelines on Income recognition, 
asset classification and provisioning (“IRACP”) prescribe the prudential 
norms for the identification and classification of non-performing assets 
(“NPA”) and the minimum provision required for such assets.
The Bank is required to have Board approved policy as per IRACP 
guidelines for NPA identification and provision. 
The Bank is also required to apply its judgment to determine the 
identification and provision required against NPAs by applying 
quantitative as well as qualitative factors. The risk of identification of 
NPAs is affected by factors like stress and liquidity concerns in certain 
sectors. 
The provision on NPA is estimated based on ageing and classification 
of NPAs, recovery estimates, nature of loan product, value of security 
and other qualitative factors and is subject to the minimum provisioning 
norms specified by RBI and approved policy of the Bank in this regard. 
Additionally, the Bank makes provisions on exposures that are not 
classified as NPAs including advances to certain sectors and identified 
advances or group advances that can potentially slip into NPA. These 
are classiﬁed as contingency provisions.
The Management of the Bank also makes an assessment of the impact 
on borrowers’ accounts which were restructured as per RBI Circulars 
issued to provide relief to the borrowers. 
Since the identification of NPAs and provisioning for advances require 
a significant level of estimation and given its significance to the overall 
audit including possible observation by RBI which could result into 
disclosure in the financial statements, we have ascertained identification 
and provisioning for NPAs as a key audit matter.
Tested the design and operating effectiveness of key controls (including 
application controls) over approval, recording, monitoring, and recovery 
of loans, monitoring overdue / stressed accounts, identification of NPA, 
provision for NPA, and valuation of security including collateral. 
Testing of Application controls includes testing of automated controls, 
reports and system reconciliations.
Evaluated the governance process and tested controls over calculations 
of provision on non-performing advances, basis of provisioning in 
accordance with the Board approved policy.
Selected the borrowers based on quantitative and qualitative risk factors 
for their assessment of appropriate classification as NPA including 
computation of overdue ageing to assess its correct classification and 
provision amount as per extant IRACP norms and Bank policy. 
Performed other substantive procedures including but not limited to 
the following:
• Selected samples of performing loans and assessed independently 
as to whether those should be classified as NPA;
• For samples selected examined the security valuation, financial 
statements and other qualitative information of the borrowers;
• Considered the accounts reported by the Bank and other Banks as 
Special Mention Accounts (“SMA”) in RBI’s Central Repository of 
Information on Large Credits (CRILC) to identify stress;
• For selected samples assessed independently accounts that can 
potentially be classified as NPA and Red Flagged Accounts;
• Performed inquiries with the credit and risk departments to ascertain 
if there were indicators of stress or an occurrence of an event of 
default in a particular loan account or any product category which 
needed to be considered as NPA;
• Held specific discussions with the management of the Bank on 
sectors where there is perceived credit risk and the steps taken to 
mitigate the risks to identified sectors;
• Selected and tested samples of accounts which were restructured 
under MSME restructuring circular and Resolution Framework for 
COVID-19 related stress circular for their compliance with the RBI 
directions; and
• Assessed the adequacy of disclosures against the relevant 
accounting standards and RBI requirements relating to NPAs.

Key Audit Matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
The Bank has material open tax litigations which involve significant 
judgement to determine the possible outcome of these disputes.
Significant management judgement is needed in determining whether 
an obligation exists and whether a provision should be recognised as 
at the reporting date, in accordance with the accounting criteria set 
under Accounting Standard 29 - Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and 
Contingent Assets (‘AS 29’), or whether it needs to be disclosed as a 
contingent liability. Further significant judgements are also involved in 
measuring such obligations, the most significant of which are:
• Assessment of liability: Judgement is involved in the determination 
of whether an outflow in respect of identified material matters are 
probable and can be estimated reliably;
• Adequacy of provisions: The appropriateness of assumptions and 
judgements used in the estimation of significant provisions; and
• Adequacy of disclosures of provision for liabilities and charges, and 
contingent liabilities.
The Bank’s assessment is supported by the facts of matter, their own 
judgement, experience, and advises from legal and independent tax 
consultants wherever considered necessary. 
Since the assessment of these open litigations requires significant level 
of judgement in interpretation of law, we have included this as a key 
audit matter.
Our Audit procedures with respect to this matter included:
Testing the design and operating effectiveness of the Bank’s key 
controls over the estimation, monitoring and disclosure of provisions 
and contingent liabilities.
Our substantive audit procedures included and were not limited to the 
following: 
• Obtained an understanding of the Bank’s process for determining 
tax liabilities, tax provisions and contingent liabilities pertaining to 
legal matters and taxation matters;
• Obtained list of cases / matters in respect of which litigations were 
outstanding as at reporting date:
Ø For significant legal matters, we sought external confirmations 
and also corroborated with management’s documented 
conclusions on the assessment of outstanding litigations against 
the Bank;
Ø For significant taxation matters, we involved our tax specialist 
to gain an understanding of the current status of the litigations, 
including understanding of various orders / notices received by 
the Bank and the management’s grounds of appeals before the 
relevant appellate authorities.
• Evaluated the merit of the subject matter under consideration 
with reference to the grounds presented therein and available 
independent legal / tax advice; and 
• Agreed underlying tax balances to supporting documentation, 
including correspondence with tax authorities.
• Assessed the disclosures in the standalone financial statements.

Independent Auditor's Report
Information Technology (“IT”) Systems and Controls 
Key Audit Matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
The Bank has a complex IT architecture to support its day-to-day 
business operations. High volume of transactions are processed and 
recorded on single or multiple applications. 
The reliability and security of IT systems plays a key role in the business 
operations of the Bank. Since large volume of transactions are 
processed daily, the IT controls are required to ensure that applications 
process data as expected and that changes are made in an appropriate 
manner. 
Appropriate IT general controls and application controls are required to 
ensure that such IT systems are able to process the data, as required, 
completely, accurately and consistently for reliable financial reporting. 
We have identified ‘IT systems and controls’ as key audit matter because 
of the high level automation, significant number of systems being used 
by the management and the complexity of the IT architecture and its 
impact on the financial reporting system. 
Our Audit procedures with respect to this matter included:
For testing the IT general controls, application controls and IT dependent 
manual controls, we involved specialists as part of the audit. The team 
also assisted in testing the accuracy of the information produced by the 
Bank’s IT systems. 
Obtained 
comprehensive 
understanding 
applications 
implemented at the Bank. It was followed by process understanding, 
mapping of applications to the same and understanding financial risks 
posed by people-process and technology. 
Key IT audit procedures includes testing design and operating 
effectiveness of  key controls operating over user access management 
(which includes user access provisioning, de-provisioning, access 
review, password configuration review, segregation of duties and 
privilege access), change management (which include change release 
in production environment are compliant to the defined procedures 
and segregation of environment is ensured), program development 
(which include review of data migration activity), computer operations 
(which includes testing of key controls pertaining to, backup, Batch 
processing (including interface testing), incident management and data 
centre security), System interface controls. This included testing that 
requests for access to systems were appropriately logged, reviewed 
and authorized.
In addition to the above, the design and operating effectiveness of 
certain automated controls, that were considered as key internal system 
controls over financial reporting were tested. Using various techniques 
such as inquiry, review of documentation / record / reports, observation 
and re-performance. We also tested few controls using negative testing 
technique. We had taken adequate samples of instances for our test. 
Tested compensating controls and performed alternate procedures, 
where necessary. In addition, understood where relevant, changes 
made to the IT landscape during the audit period. 
Information Other than the Standalone Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Bank’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information in the Basel 
III - Pillar 3 disclosures and graphical representation of financial highlights but does not include the financial statements and our 
auditor’s reports thereon, which we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, and the Annual Report, which is expected to 
be made available to us after that date. 
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or our knowledge obtained 
in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that 
we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, 
we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
When we read the Annual Report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate 
the matter to Those Charged with Governance.

Statutory Reports and 
Financial Statements
Responsibilities of Management and Those charged with Governance for Standalone Financial 
Statements 
The Bank’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation 
of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance and cash 
flows of the Bank in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Accounting Standards 
specified under Section 133 of the Act and the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and circulars, guidelines and directions issued by the 
RBI from time to time (the “RBI Guidelines”) as applicable to the Bank. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the RBI Guidelines for safeguarding of the assets of the Bank 
and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making 
judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant 
to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the standalone financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Bank’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 
Those Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Bank’s financial reporting process. 
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect 
a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or 
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
standalone financial statements. 
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout 
the audit. We also:
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting 
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Bank 
has internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of 
such controls.
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by the Management of the Bank.
Conclude on the appropriateness of Management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit 
evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention 
in our Auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to 
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, 
future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern.
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone financial statements, including the disclosures, 
and whether the standalone financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves 
fair presentation. 

Independent Auditor's Report
We communicate with Those Charged with Governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit 
and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide Those Charged with Governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with Those Charged with Governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance 
in the audit of the standalone financial statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2022 and are therefore the key audit 
matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter 
or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the 
adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 read with Section 133 of the Act and relevant rules issued thereunder.

Independent Auditor's Report
Annexure A to the Independent Auditor’s Report of even date on the Standalone 
Financial Statements of HDFC Bank Limited
[Referred to in paragraph 3(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ in the Independent Auditor’s Report of 
even date to the Members of HDFC Bank Limited on the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2022] 
Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies 
Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements of HDFC Bank Limited (“the Bank”) as of March 
31, 2022 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial statements of the Bank for the year ended on that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The Bank’s Board of Directors is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control 
with reference to financial statements criteria established by the Bank considering the essential components of internal control 
stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (ICAI) (the “Guidance Note”). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of 
internal financial controls with reference to financial statements that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient 
conduct of its business, including adherence to Bank’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds 
and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, 
as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bank's internal financial controls with reference to financial statements based on our 
audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, issued by ICAI and deemed 
to be prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls. Those Standards 
and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether internal financial controls with reference to financial statements was established and maintained and if 
such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, assessing the 
risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on 
the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the 
Bank’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With reference to Financial Statements
A Bank’s internal financial control with reference to financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles. A Bank's internal financial control with reference to financial statements includes 
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect 
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Bank; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as 
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that 
receipts and expenditures of the Bank are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls With reference to financial statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, including the possibility of 
collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements to future periods are subject 
to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Bank has, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and 
such internal financial controls with reference to financial statements were operating effectively as at March 31, 2022, based on 
the internal control with reference to financial statements criteria established by the Bank considering the essential components of 
internal control stated in the Guidance Note.

Schedules to the Financial Statements
As at March 31, 2022
Schedule 17 - Significant accounting policies 
appended to and forming part of the financial 
statements for the year ended March 31, 2022
Background
 
HDFC Bank Limited (‘HDFC Bank’ or ‘the Bank’), 
incorporated in Mumbai, India is a publicly held banking 
company engaged in providing a range of banking and 
financial services including retail banking, wholesale 
banking and treasury operations. The Bank is governed 
by the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and the Companies 
Act, 2013. The Bank has overseas branch operations in 
Bahrain, Hong Kong, Dubai and Offshore Banking Unit at 
International Financial Service Centre (IFSC), GIFT City, 
India. The financial accounting systems of the Bank are 
centralised and, therefore, accounting returns are not 
required to be submitted by branches of the Bank.
Basis of Preparation
 
The financial statements have been prepared and presented 
under the historical cost convention and accrual basis of 
accounting, unless otherwise stated and are in accordance 
with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in India 
(‘GAAP’), statutory requirements prescribed under the Third 
Schedule of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, circulars 
and guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India (‘RBI’) 
from time to time (RBI guidelines), Accounting Standards 
(‘AS’) specified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 
2013 read together with the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 
2014 and the Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 
2021, in so far as they apply to banks.
 
Use of estimates
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity 
with GAAP requires the management to make estimates 
and necessary assumptions in the reported amounts of 
assets and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) as 
of the date of the financial statements and the reported 
income and expenses for the reporting year. Management 
believes that the estimates used in the preparation of the 
financial statements are prudent and reasonable. Actual 
results could differ from these estimates. Any revision in 
the accounting estimates is recognised prospectively in the 
current and future periods.
Principal Accounting Policies 

Investments 
 
Classification:
 
In accordance with the RBI guidelines, investments are 
classified on the date of purchase into “Held for Trading” 
(‘HFT’), “Available for Sale” (‘AFS’) and “Held to Maturity” 
(‘HTM’) categories (hereinafter called “categories”). 
Subsequent shifting amongst the categories is done 
in accordance with the RBI guidelines. Under each of 
these categories, investments are further classified under 
six groups (hereinafter called “groups”) - Government 
Securities, Other Approved Securities, Shares, Debentures 
and Bonds, Investments in Subsidiaries / Joint Ventures 
and Other Investments. 
 
Purchase and sale transactions in securities are accounted 
on settlement date except in the case of equity shares 
which are accounted on trade date.
 
Basis of classification:
 
Investments that are held for resale within 90 days from 
the date of purchase are classified under HFT category. 
Investments which the Bank intends to hold till maturity are 
classified under HTM category. Investments in the equity 
of subsidiaries / joint ventures are categorised as HTM. 
Investments which are not classified in either of the above 
categories are classified under AFS category.
 
Acquisition cost: 
 
Brokerage, commission, etc. and broken period interest 
on debt instruments are recognised in the Profit and Loss 
Account and are not included in the cost of acquisition.
 
Disposal of investments:
 
Profit / Loss on sale of investments under the aforesaid 
three categories is recognised in the Profit and Loss 
Account. Cost of investments is based on the weighted 
average cost method. The profit from sale of investment 
under HTM category, net of taxes and transfer to statutory 
reserve is appropriated from the Profit and Loss Account 
to “Capital Reserve”.
 
Short sale:
 
The Bank undertakes short sale transactions in Central 
Government dated securities. The short position is 
categorised under HFT category and netted off from 
investments. The short position is marked to market and 
loss, if any, is charged to the Profit and Loss Account 
while gain, if any, is ignored. Profit / Loss on short sale is 
recognised on settlement date.
 
Valuation:
 
Investments classified under AFS and HFT categories are 
marked to market individually and depreciation / appreciation 
is aggregated for each group and net depreciation in each 
group is provided and net appreciation is ignored. 
 
Traded investments are valued based on the trades / 
quotes on the recognised stock exchanges or prices 
published by Financial Benchmarks India Pvt Ltd.

(FBIL) with Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives 
Association (FIMMDA) as the calculating agent. Investments 
denominated in foreign currencies are valued based on the 
prices provided by market information providers such as 
Bloomberg, Refinitiv, etc.
 
The market value of unquoted government of India securities, 
state government securities and special bonds such as oil 
bonds, fertilizer bonds, etc. issued by the government of 
India is computed as per the prices published by FBIL with 
FIMMDA as the calculating agent. 
 
The valuation of other unquoted fixed income securities (viz. 
other approved securities and bonds and debentures), and 
preference shares, is done with appropriate mark-up, i.e. 
applicable FIMMDA published credit spread over the Yield 
to Maturity (YTM) rates for government of India securities as 
published by FBIL with FIMMDA as the calculating agent.
 
Unquoted equity shares are valued at the break-up 
value, if the latest Balance Sheet is available or at ` 1 for 
each company.
 
Units of mutual funds are valued at the latest net asset value 
declared by the respective schemes of the mutual fund. 
 
Treasury bills, commercial papers and certificate of deposits 
being discounted instruments, are valued at carrying cost. 
 
Investments in Security receipts (SR) and unquoted units 
of Infrastructure Investment Trust (InvIT) are valued as 
per the net asset value provided by the issuing Asset 
Reconstruction Company and InvIT trust respectively. 
 
Investments in unquoted Venture Capital Fund (VCF) are 
categorised, at the discretion of the Bank, under HTM 
category for an initial period of three years and valued at 
cost during this period. Such investments are transferred 
to the AFS category after the said period of three years. 
Investments in AFS category are valued at NAV shown by 
the VCF in its financial statements. Units are valued based 
on the latest audited financials of the VCF, if available or at 
` 1 per VCF as per the RBI guidelines.
 Pass Through Certificates (PTC) including Priority SectorPTCs are valued by using FIMMDA credit spread as 
applicable for the NBFC category, based on the credit rating 
of the respective PTC over the YTM rates for government 
of India securities published by FBIL with FIMMDA as the 
calculating agent. 
 Net depreciation, if any, compared to the acquisition cost, 
in any of the six groups, is charged to the Profit and Loss 
Account. The net appreciation, if any, in any of the six groups 
is not recognised except to the extent of depreciation 
provided earlier. The book value of individual securities is 
not changed on such revaluation of investments.
 
Investments classified under HTM category are carried 
at their acquisition cost and not marked to market. Any 
premium on acquisition is amortised over the remaining 
maturity period of the security on a constant yield-tomaturity basis. Such amortisation of premium is adjusted 
against interest income from investments. Any diminution, 
other than temporary, in the value of investments in HTM 
category is provided for.
 
Non-performing investments are identified and provision 
are made thereon based on the RBI guidelines. The 
provision on such non-performing investments are not set 
off against the appreciation in respect of other performing 
investments. Interest on non-performing investments is not 
recognised until received.
 
Repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions:
 
Repurchase (Repo) and reverse repurchase (Reverse 
Repo) transactions are reflected as borrowing and lending 
transactions respectively. 
 
Borrowing cost on repo transactions is accounted as 
interest expense and revenue on reverse repo transactions 
is accounted as interest income.

Advances 
 
Classification:
 
Advances are classified as performing and non-performing 
based on the RBI guidelines and are stated net of bills 
rediscounted, inter-bank participation with risk, specific 
provisions, interest in suspense for non-performing 
advances, claims received from Credit Guarantors, 
provisions for funded interest term loan and provision for 
diminution in the fair value of restructured assets. 
 
Provisioning:
 
Specific loan loss provisions in respect of non-performing 
advances are made based on management’s assessment 
of the degree of impairment of advances, subject to the 
minimum provisioning prescribed by the RBI. 
 
The specific provision for retail non-performing assets are 
also based on the nature of product and delinquency levels. 
Specific loan loss provisions in respect of non-performing 
advances are included under Provisions and Contingencies.
 
Non-performing advances are written-off in accordance 
with the Bank’s policy. Recoveries from bad debts writtenoff are included under other income. 
 
In relation to derivative contracts with non-performing 
borrowers, the Bank makes provision for the entire amount 

Schedules to the Financial Statements
As at March 31, 2022
of overdue and future receivables relating to positive 
marked to market value of the said derivative contracts.
 
The Bank maintains general provision for standard assets 
including credit exposures computed as per the current 
marked to market values of interest rate and foreign 
exchange derivative contracts and gold. In the case of 
overseas branches, general provision on standard assets 
is maintained at the higher of the levels stipulated by the 
respective overseas regulator or RBI. Provision for standard 
assets is included under other liabilities.
 
In addition to the above, the Bank on a prudent basis 
makes provisions on advances or exposures which are not 
NPAs, but has reasons to believe on the basis of the extant 
environment or specific information or basis regulatory 
guidance / instructions, of a possible slippage of a specific 
advance or a group of advances or exposures or potential 
exposures. These are classified as contingent provisions 
and included under other liabilities.
 
Provisions made in addition to the Bank’s policy for specific 
loan loss provisions for non-performing assets, possible 
slippage of specific exposures and regulatory general 
provisions are categorised as floating provisions. Creation 
of floating provisions is considered by the Bank up to a level 
approved by the Board of Directors. Floating provisions 
are used only for contingencies under extraordinary 
circumstances and for making specific provisions for nonperforming accounts. Floating provisions are included 
under other liabilities.
 
Further to the provisions required to be held according 
to the asset classification status, provisions are held for 
individual country exposures (other than for home country 
exposure). Countries are categorised into risk categories 
as per Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd. 
(‘ECGC’) guidelines and provisioning is done in respect of 
that country where the net funded exposure is one percent 
or more of the Bank’s total assets. Provision for country risk 
is included under other liabilities.
 
In accordance with the RBI guidelines on the prudential 
framework for resolution of stressed assets and the 
resolution frameworks for COVID-19 related stress and 
its Board approved policy, the Bank has implemented 
resolution plans for eligible borrowers. The asset 
classification and necessary provisions thereon are done 
in accordance with the said RBI guidelines.

Securitisation and transfer of assets
 
Assets transferred through securitisation and direct 
assignment of cash flows are de-recognised in the Balance 
Sheet when they are sold (true sale criteria being fully met 
with) and consideration is received. Sales / transfers that do 
not meet true sale criteria are accounted for as borrowings. 
For a securitisation or direct assignment transaction, the 
Bank recognises profit upon receipt of the funds and loss 
is recognised at the time of sale.
 
On sale of stressed assets, if the sale is at a price below 
the net book value (i.e., funded outstanding less specific 
provisions held), the shortfall is charged to the Profit and 
Loss Account and if the sale is for a value higher than the 
net book value, the excess provision is credited to the 
Profit and Loss Account in the year when the sum of cash 
received by way of initial consideration and / or redemption 
or transfer of security receipts issued by SC / RC exceeds 
the net book value of the loan at the time of transfer.
 
In respect of stressed assets sold under an asset 
securitisation, where the investment by the bank in security 
receipts (SRs) backed by the assets sold by it is more than 
10 percent of such SRs, provisions held are higher of the 
provisions required in terms of net asset value declared by the 
Securitisation Company (‘SC’) / Reconstruction Company 
(‘RC’) and provisions as per the extant norms applicable to 
the underlying loans, notionally treating the book value of 
these SRs as the corresponding stressed loans assuming 
the loans remained in the books of the Bank.
 
The Bank invests in Pass Through Certificates (PTCs) 
issued by other Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs). These 
are accounted at acquisition cost and are classified as 
investments. The Bank also buys loans through the direct 
assignment route which are classified as advances. These 
are carried at acquisition cost unless it is more than the 
face value, in which case the premium is amortised based 
on effective interest rate method.
 
The Bank transfers advances through inter-bank 
participation with and without risk. In the case of participation 
with risk, the aggregate amount of the participation issued 
by the Bank is reduced from advances. In case where 
the Bank is assuming risk by participation, the aggregate 
amount of the participation is classified under advances. 
In the case of issue of participation certificate without 
risk, the aggregate amount of participation issued by the 
Bank is classified under borrowings and where the Bank 
is acquiring participation certificate, the aggregate amount 
of participation acquired is shown as due from banks 
under advances.

Fixed assets and depreciation
 
Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation as adjusted for impairment, if any. Cost 
includes cost of purchase and all expenditure like site 
preparation, installation costs and professional fees

incurred on the asset before it is ready to use. Subsequent 
expenditure incurred on assets put to use is capitalised only 
when it increases the future benefit / functioning capability 
from / of such assets. 
 
Depreciation is charged over the estimated useful life of 
the fixed asset on a straight-line basis. The management 
believes that the useful life of assets assessed by the 
Bank, pursuant to Part C of Schedule II to the Companies 
Act, 2013, taking into account changes in environment, 
changes in technology, the utility and efficacy of the asset 
in use, fairly reflects its estimate of useful lives of the fixed 
assets. The estimated useful lives of key fixed assets are

depreciated over a period of 5 years.
 Point of sales terminals are depreciated over a period 
of 4 years.
For assets purchased and sold during the year,

transfer to statutory reserve, are transferred to capital 
reserve account.
Assets (other than POS terminals) costing less than 
` 5,000 individually, are fully depreciated in the year

Impairment of assets
 
The Bank assesses at each Balance Sheet date whether 
there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. 
Impairment loss, if any, is provided to the extent the 
carrying amount of assets exceeds their estimated 
recoverable amount.

Translation of foreign currency items
 
Foreign currency income and expenditure items of domestic 
operations are translated at the exchange rates prevailing 
on the date of the transaction. Income and expenditure 
items of integral foreign operations (representative offices) 
are translated at the weekly average closing rates and 
of non-integral foreign operations (foreign branches and 
offshore banking units) at the monthly average closing rates.
 
Foreign currency monetary items of domestic and integral 
foreign operations are translated at the closing exchange 
rates notified by Foreign Exchange Dealers’ Association 
of India (FEDAI) as at the Balance Sheet date and the 
resulting net revaluation profit or loss arising due to a net 
open position in any foreign currency is recognised in the 
Profit and Loss Account.
 
Both monetary and non-monetary foreign currency 
assets and liabilities of non-integral foreign operations 
are translated at closing exchange rates notified by FEDAI 
at the Balance Sheet date and the resulting profit / loss 
arising from exchange differences are accumulated in the 
Foreign Currency Translation Account until disposal of the 
non-integral foreign operations in accordance with AS - 11, 
The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates and the 
extant RBI guidelines. 
 
Foreign currency denominated contingent liabilities on 
account of foreign exchange and derivative contracts, 
guarantees, letters of credit, acceptances and 
endorsements are reported at closing rates of exchange 
notified by FEDAI as at the Balance Sheet date.

Foreign exchange and derivative contracts
 
Foreign exchange spot and forward contracts, both 
deliverable and non-deliverable, outstanding as at the 
Balance Sheet date and held for trading, are revalued at 
the closing spot and forward rates respectively as notified 
by FEDAI and at interpolated rates for contracts of interim 
maturities. The USD-INR exchange rate for valuation of 
contracts having longer maturities i.e. greater than one year, 
is derived using the USD-INR spot rate as well as relevant 
INR yield curve and USD yield curve. For other currency 
pairs, the forward points (for rates / tenors not published 
by FEDAI) are obtained from Refinitiv or Bloomberg for 
valuation of the forex deals. Valuation is considered on 

Schedules to the Financial Statements
As at March 31, 2022
present value basis. For this purpose, the forward profit 
or loss on the deals are discounted till the valuation date 
using the discounting yields. The resulting profit or loss 
on valuation is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account. 
Foreign exchange contracts are classified as assets when 
the fair value is positive (positive marked to market value) or 
as liabilities when the fair value is negative (negative marked 
to market value).
 
Foreign exchange forward contracts not intended for 
trading, that are entered into to establish the amount of 
reporting currency required or available at the settlement 
date of a transaction, and are outstanding at the Balance 
Sheet date, are effectively valued at the closing spot rate. 
The premium or discount arising at the inception of such 
forward exchange contract is amortised as expense or 
income over the life of the contract. 
 
The Bank recognises all derivative contracts at fair value, on 
the date on which the derivative contracts are entered into 
and are re-measured at fair value as at the Balance Sheet 
date. Derivatives are classified as assets when the fair value 
is positive (positive marked to market value) or as liabilities 
when the fair value is negative (negative marked to market 
value).
 
The Bank as part of its risk management strategy, makes 
use of financial derivative instruments, including foreign 
exchange forward contracts, for hedging the risk embedded 
in some of its financial assets or liabilities recognised on the 
balance sheet. The Bank identifies the hedged item (asset 
or liability) at the inception of the transaction itself. Hedge 
effectiveness is ascertained at the time of the inception of 
the hedge and at the reporting date thereafter.
 
In case of a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of 
the hedging instruments and hedged items are recognised 
in the Profit and Loss Account and in case of cash flow 
hedges, the changes in fair value of effective portion are 
recognised in Reserves and Surplus under ‘Cash flow 
hedge reserve’ and ineffective portion of an effective 
hedging relationship, if any, is recognised in the Profit 
and Loss Account. The accumulated balance in the cash 
flow hedge reserve, in an effective hedging relationship, is 
recycled in the Profit and Loss Account at the same time 
that the impact from the hedged item is recognised in the 
Profit and Loss Account.

Revenue recognition
 
Interest income is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account 
on an accrual basis, except in the case of non-performing 
assets and overdue interest on retail EMI based performing 
advances, which are recognised when realised. In case 
of domestic advances, where interest is collected on rear 
end basis, such interest is accounted on receipt basis in 
accordance with the RBI communication.
 
Interest income on investments in PTCs and loans bought 
out through the direct assignment route is recognised at 
their effective interest rate.
 
Income on non-coupon bearing discounted instruments is 
recognised over the tenor of the instrument on a constant 
yield basis.
 
Loan processing fee is recognised as income when due. 
Syndication / Arranger fee is recognised as income when 
a significant act / milestone is completed.
 
Gain / loss on sell down of loans is recognised in line with 
the extant RBI guidelines.
 
Dividend on equity shares, preference shares and on 
mutual fund units is recognised as income when the right 
to receive the dividend is established.
 
Guarantee commission, commission on letter of credit, 
annual locker rent fees and annual fees for credit cards 
are recognised on a straight-line basis over the period 
of contract. Other fees and commission income are 
recognised when due, where the Bank is reasonably 
certain of ultimate collection.
 
Fees paid / received for priority sector lending certificates 
(PSLC) is recognised on straight-line basis over the period 
of the certificate.

Employee benefits
 
Employee Stock Option Scheme (ESOS):
 
The Employee Stock Option Scheme (‘the Scheme’) 
provides for the grant of options to acquire equity shares 
of the Bank to its employees and whole time directors. 
The options granted to employees vest as per their vesting 
schedule and these may be exercised by the employees 
within a specified period. 
 
The Bank follows the intrinsic value method to account for 
its stock-based employee compensation plans in respect of 
options granted up to March 31, 2021. Compensation cost 
is measured by the excess, if any, of the market price of 
the underlying stock over the exercise price as determined 
under the option plan. The market price is the closing 
price on the stock exchange where there is highest trading 
volume on the working day immediately preceding the date 
of grant. Compensation cost, if any is amortised over the 
vesting period.
 
Effective April 01, 2021, the fair value of share-linked 
instruments on the date of grant for all instruments granted 
after March 31, 2021 is recognised as an expense in

accordance with the RBI guidelines on Compensation of 
Whole Time Directors/ Chief Executive Officers/ Material 
Risk Takers and Control Function staff. The fair value of the 
stock-based employee compensation is estimated using 
Black-Scholes model. The compensation cost is amortised 
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the option 
with a corresponding credit to Employee Stock Options 
Reserve. On exercise of the stock options, corresponding 
balance in Employee Stock Options Reserve is transferred 
to Share Premium. In respect of the options which expire 
unexercised, the balance standing to the credit of Employee 
Stock Options Reserve is transferred to General Reserve.
 
Gratuity:
 
The Bank has an obligation towards gratuity, a defined 
benefit retirement plan covering all eligible employees. 
The plan benefit vests upon completion of five years of 
service and is in the form of lump sum amount, without an 
upper limit, equivalent to 15 days’ basic salary payable for 
each completed year of service to all eligible employees on 
resignation, retirement, death while in employment or on 
termination of employment. The Bank makes contributions 
to a recognised Gratuity Trust administered by trustees and 
whose funds are managed by insurance companies. In 
respect of erstwhile Lord Krishna Bank (eLKB) employees, 
the Bank makes contribution to a fund set up by eLKB and 
administered by the Board of Trustees. 
 
The defined gratuity benefit plans are valued by an 
independent actuary as at the Balance Sheet date using 
the projected unit credit method as per the requirement of 
AS-15, Employee Benefits, to determine the present value 
of the defined benefit obligation and the related service 
costs. The actuarial calculations entails assumptions about 
demographics, early retirement, salary increases and 
interest rates. Actuarial gain or loss is recognised in the 
Profit and Loss Account.
 
Superannuation:
 
The Bank has a Superannuation Plan under which 
employees of the Bank, above a prescribed grade, are 
entitled to receive retirement benefits either through salary 
or under a defined contribution plan. For those opting for 
a defined contribution plan, the Bank contributes a sum 
equivalent to 13% of the employee’s eligible annual basic 
salary (15% for the whole time directors and for certain 
eligible employees of the erstwhile Centurion Bank of 
Punjab (eCBoP) staff) to a Trust administered by trustees 
and whose funds are managed by insurance companies. 
The Bank has no liability towards future superannuation 
fund benefits other than its contribution and recognises 
such contribution as an expense in the year incurred.
 
Provident fund:
 
The Bank is covered under the Employees Provident Fund 
and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 and accordingly 
all employees of the Bank are entitled to receive benefits 
under the provident fund. The Bank contributes an amount, 
on a monthly basis, at a determined rate (currently 12% 
of employee’s basic salary). Of this, the Bank contributes 
an amount equal to 8.33% of employee’s basic salary up 
to a maximum salary level of ` 15,000/- per month, to the 
Pension Scheme administered by the Regional Provident 
Fund Office. The balance amount of the 12% employer’s 
share is contributed to an exempted Trust set up by the 
Bank and administered by a Board of Trustees. The Bank 
recognises such contributions as an expense in the year in 
which it is incurred. 
 
Interest payable to the members of the exempted trust shall 
not be lower than the statutory rate of interest declared by 
the Central Government under the Employees Provident 
Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 and 
shortfall, if any, shall be made good by the Bank.
 
The guidance note on implementing AS-15, Employee 
Benefits, states that benefits involving employer established 
provident funds, which require interest shortfalls to be 
provided, are to be considered as defined benefit plans. 
Actuarial valuation of this Provident Fund interest shortfall 
is done as per the guidance note issued in this respect by 
The Institute of Actuaries of India (IAI) and provision towards 
this liability is made.
 
The overseas branches of the Bank make contribution to the 
respective applicable government social security scheme 
calculated as a percentage of the employees’ salaries. 
The Bank’s obligations are limited to these contributions, 
which are expensed when due, as such contribution is in 
the nature of defined contribution.
 
Pension:
 
In respect of pension payable to certain eLKB employees 
under the Lord Krishna Bank (Employees) Pension 
Scheme, which is a defined benefit scheme, the Bank 
contributes 10% of basic salary to a pension trust set up 
by the Bank and administered by the Board of Trustees and 
an additional amount towards the liability shortfall based on 
an independent actuarial valuation as at the Balance Sheet 
date, which includes assumptions about demographics, 
early retirement, salary increases and interest rates.
 
In respect of certain eLKB employees who had moved to 
a Cost to Company (CTC) based compensation structure 
and had completed less than 15 years of service, the 
contribution which was made until then, is maintained as a 
fund and will be converted into annuity on separation after a

lock-in-period of two years. For this category of employees, 
liability stands frozen and no additional provision is required 
except for interest as applicable to Provident Fund, which 
is provided for.
 
In respect of certain eLKB employees who moved to a CTC 
structure and had completed service of more than 15 years, 
pension would be paid on separation based on salary 
applicable as on the date of movement to CTC structure. 
Provision thereto is made based on an independent 
actuarial valuation as at the Balance Sheet date.
 
National Pension Scheme (NPS):
 
In respect of employees who opt for contribution to the 
NPS, the Bank contributes certain percentage of the basic 
salary of employees to the aforesaid scheme, a defined 
contribution plan, which is managed and administered by 
pension fund management companies. The Bank has no 
liability other than its contribution and recognises such 
contributions as an expense in the year incurred.
10 Debit and credit card reward points
 
The Bank estimates the probable redemption of debit 
and credit card reward points and cost per point using an 
actuarial method by employing an independent actuary, 
which includes assumptions such as mortality, redemption 
and spends. Provisions for liabilities on the outstanding 
reward points are made based on an independent actuarial 
valuation as at the Balance Sheet date and included in 
other liabilities and provisions.
11 Bullion
 
The Bank imports bullion including precious metal bars on 
a consignment basis. The imports are typically on a backto-back basis and are priced to the customer based on 
the price quoted by the supplier. The difference between 
the price recovered from customers and cost of bullion 
is accounted at the time of sale to the customers and 
reported as ‘‘Other Income’’.
 
The Bank also deals in bullion on a borrowing and lending 
basis and the interest thereon is accounted as interest 
expense / income respectively.
12 Lease accounting
 
Lease payments including cost escalation for assets taken 
on operating lease are recognised in the Profit and Loss 
Account over the lease term on a straight-line basis in 
accordance with the AS-19, Leases. 
13 Income tax
 
Income tax expense comprises current tax provision (i.e. 
the amount of tax for the period determined in accordance 
with the Income Tax Act, 1961, the rules framed there 
under and considering the material principles set out in 
Income Computation and Disclosure Standards) and the 
net change in the deferred tax asset or liability during the 
year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for 
the future tax consequences of timing differences between 
the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their 
respective tax bases, and operating loss carried forward, 
if any. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using 
the enacted or substantively enacted tax rates as at the 
Balance Sheet date. 
 
Current tax assets and liabilities and deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are off-set when they relate to income taxes 
levied by the same taxation authority, when the Bank has 
a legal right to off-set and when the Bank intends to settle 
on a net basis.
 
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent there 
is reasonable certainty that the assets can be realised 
in future. In case of unabsorbed depreciation or carried 
forward loss under taxation laws, deferred tax assets are 
recognised only if there is virtual certainty of realisation 
of such assets. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each 
Balance Sheet date and appropriately adjusted to reflect the 
amount that is reasonably / virtually certain to be realised.
14 Earnings per share
 
The Bank reports basic and diluted earnings per equity 
share in accordance with AS-20, Earnings per Share. Basic 
earnings per equity share has been computed by dividing 
net profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders by 
the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding 
for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential 
dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to 
issue equity shares were exercised or converted to equity 
during the year. Diluted earnings per equity share are 
computed using the weighted average number of equity 
shares and the dilutive potential equity shares outstanding 
during the period except where the results are anti-dilutive. 
15 Share issue expenses
 
Share issue expenses are adjusted against Share Premium 
Account in terms of Section 52 of the Companies Act, 2013.
16 Segment information 
 
The disclosure relating to segment information is in 
accordance with AS-17, Segment Reporting and as per 
guidelines issued by RBI.

17 Accounting for provisions, contingent liabilities 
and contingent assets
 
In accordance with AS-29, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities 
and Contingent Assets, the Bank recognises provisions 
when it has a present obligation as a result of a past event, 
it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation 
and when a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation 
can be made. 
 
Provisions are determined based on management estimate 
required to settle the obligation at the Balance Sheet date, 
supplemented by experience of similar transactions. These 
are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and adjusted to 
reflect the current management estimates.
 
A disclosure of contingent liability is made when there is:
a possible obligation arising from a past event, the 
existence of which will be confirmed by the occurrence 
or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future 
events not within the control of the Bank; or
a present obligation arising from a past event which 
is not recognised as it is not probable that an outflow 
of resources will be required to settle the obligation 
or a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation 
cannot be made.
 
When there is a possible obligation or a present obligation 
in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is 
remote, no provision or disclosure is made.
 
Contingent assets, if any, are not recognised in the financial 
statements since this may result in the recognition of 
income that may never be realised.
18 Cash and cash equivalents
 
Cash and cash equivalents include cash including 
foreign currency notes and gold in hand, balances with 
RBI, balances with other banks and money at call and 
short notice.
19 Corporate social responsibility
 
Expenditure towards corporate social responsibility, in 
accordance with Companies Act, 2013, is recognised in 
the Profit and Loss Account.

Schedules to the Financial Statements
For the year ended March 31, 2022
Schedule 18 - Notes forming part of the financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2022
Amounts in notes forming part of the financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2022 are denominated in rupee crore to 
conform to extant RBI guidelines, except where stated otherwise.
Dividend
 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), vide its notification dated April 22, 2021 mentioned that banks may pay dividend on equity 
shares from the profits for the financial year ended March 31, 2021, subject to the quantum of dividend being not more than 
fifty per cent of the amount determined as per the dividend payout ratio prescribed by RBI. Accordingly, the Bank has paid 
dividend of ` 6.50 per equity share of ` 1/- each aggregating to ` 3,592.40 crore, for the financial year ended March 31, 2021.
2. Proposed scheme of amalgamation
 
The Board of Directors at its meeting held on April 04, 2022, approved a composite Scheme of amalgamation ("Scheme"), 
for the amalgamation of: (i) HDFC Investments Limited and HDFC Holdings Limited, into and with Housing Development 
Finance Corporation Limited ("HDFC Limited"); and thereafter (ii) HDFC Limited into HDFC Bank Limited, and their respective 
shareholders and creditors, under Sections 230 to 232 of the Companies Act, 2013 and other applicable laws including the 
rules and regulations. The share exchange ratio shall be 42 equity shares of face value of ` 1/- each of the Bank for every 25 
equity shares of face value of ` 2/- each of HDFC Limited. The Scheme is subject to the receipt of requisite approvals from 
statutory and regulatory authorities, and the respective shareholders and creditors, under applicable law.
 
As per the scheme, the appointed date for the amalgamation of HDFC Limited with and into the Bank shall be the effective 
date of the scheme. Upon the scheme becoming effective, the Bank will issue equity shares to the shareholders of HDFC 
Limited as on the record date. The equity shares held by HDFC Limited in the Bank will be extinguished as per the scheme.
3. Change in accounting policy
 
The RBI, vide its clarification dated August 30, 2021 on Guidelines on Compensation of Whole Time Directors / Chief Executive 
Officers / Material Risk Takers and Control Function Staff, advised Banks that the fair value of share-linked instruments on the 
date of grant should be recognised as an expense for all instruments granted after the accounting period ending March 31, 
2021. Accordingly, the Bank has changed its accounting policy from the intrinsic value method to the fair value method for all 
employee stock options granted after March 31, 2021. The fair value is estimated on the date of grant using Black-Scholes 
model and is recognised as compensation expense over the vesting period. As a result, ‘Employees cost’ for the year ended 
March 31, 2022 is higher by ` 325.97 crore with a consequent reduction in profit after tax by the said amount.
4. Capital adequacy
 
The Bank’s capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (‘Capital Adequacy Ratio’) is calculated in accordance with the RBI guidelines 
on Basel III capital regulations (‘Basel III’). The phasing in of the minimum capital ratio requirement under Basel III is as follows:

shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per equity share 
has been computed by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to the equity shareholders by the weighted average 
number of equity shares and dilutive potential equity shares outstanding during the year, except where the results are antidilutive. The dilutive impact is on account of stock options granted to employees by the Bank. There is no impact of dilution 
on the profits in the current year and previous year.

Reserve on derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedge.
 
Employee Stock Option Reserve
 
During the year ended March 31, 2022, the Bank has recognised ` 325.97 crore (previous year: Nil) as Employee Stock Option 
Reserve on account of fair valuation of share-linked instruments.
 
Draw down from Reserves
 
The Bank has not undertaken any drawdown from reserves during the years ended March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021.
Accounting for employee share based payments
 
The shareholders of the Bank approved the grant of equity share options under Plan “C” in June 2005, Plan “D” in June 2007, 
Plan “E” in June 2010, Plan “F” in June 2013 and Plan “G” in July 2016. Under the terms of each of these Plans, the Bank may 
issue to its employees and Whole Time Directors, Equity Stock Options (‘ESOPs’) each of which is convertible into one equity 
share. All the plans were framed in accordance with the SEBI (Employee Stock Option Scheme & Employee Stock Purchase 
Scheme) Guidelines, 1999 as amended from time to time and as applicable at the time of the grant. The accounting for the 
stock options has been in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Share Based Employee Benefits and 
Sweaty Equity) Regulations, 2021 and RBI guidelines to the extent applicable.
 
Plans C, D, E, F and G provide for the issuance of options at the recommendation of the Nomination and Remuneration 
Committee of the Board (‘NRC’) at the closing price on the working day immediately preceding the date when options are 
granted. This closing price is the closing price of the Bank’s equity share on an Indian stock exchange with the highest trading 
volume as of the working day preceding the date of grant.
 
The vesting conditions applicable to the options are at the discretion of the NRC. These options are exercisable on vesting, 
for a period as set forth by the NRC at the time of the grant. The period in which the options may be exercised cannot exceed 
five years from date of expiry of vesting period. During the financial year 2021-22, certain modifications were made in the 
subsisting ESOP Plans pursuant to the approval of the shareholders of the Bank as to allow any employee of the Bank moving 
/ getting transferred to a subsidiary company, to be so entitled to the stock options already granted to such an employee as 
continuity of service for Long Term Incentives earned during the course of his / her service with the Bank.

Statutory Reports and

The Bank has presented gross unrealised gain on foreign exchange and derivative contracts under other assets and 
gross unrealised loss on foreign exchange and derivative contracts under other liabilities. Accordingly, other liabilities 
as at March 31, 2022 include unrealised loss on foreign exchange and derivative contracts of ` 7,464.74 crore (previous 
year: ` 8,127.65 crore).
9. Unhedged foreign currency exposure
 
The Bank has in place a policy and process for managing currency induced credit risk. The credit appraisal memorandum 
prepared at the time of origination and review of a credit facility is required to discuss the exchange risk that the customer 
is exposed to from all sources, including trade related, foreign currency borrowings and external commercial borrowings. It 
could cover the natural hedge available to the customer as well as other hedging methods adopted by the customer to mitigate 
exchange risk. For foreign currency loans granted by the Bank beyond a defined threshold the customer is encouraged to 
enter into appropriate risk hedging mechanisms with the Bank. Alternatively, the Bank satisfies itself that the customer has 
the financial capacity to bear the exchange risk in the normal course of its business and / or has other mitigants to reduce the 
risk. On a monthly basis, the Bank reviews information on the unhedged portion of foreign currency exposures of customers, 
whose total foreign currency exposure with the Bank exceeds a defined threshold. Based on the monthly review, the Bank 
proposes suitable hedging techniques to the customer to contain the risk. A Board approved credit risk rating linked limit on 
unhedged foreign currency position of customers is applicable when extending credit facilities to a customer. The compliance 
with the limit is assessed by estimating the extent of drop in a customer’s annual Earnings Before Interest and Depreciation 
(‘EBID’) due to a potentially large adverse movement in exchange rate impacting the unhedged foreign currency exposure of 
the customer. Where a breach is observed in such a simulation, the customer is advised to reduce its unhedged exposure.
 
In accordance with RBI guidelines, as at March 31, 2022 the Bank holds standard asset provisions of ` 355.00 crore (previous 
year: ` 230.31 crore) and maintains capital (including CCB & D-SIB) of ` 1,412.67 crore (previous year: ` 918.77 crore) in respect 
of the unhedged foreign currency exposure of its customers.

Qualitative disclosures on risk exposure in derivatives
 
Overview of business and processes
Derivatives are financial instruments whose characteristics are derived from underlying assets, or from interest rates, exchange 
rates or indices. These include forwards, swaps, futures and options. The notional amounts of financial instruments such as 
foreign exchange contracts and derivatives provide a basis for comparison with the instruments recognised on the Balance 
Sheet but do not necessarily indicate the amounts of future cash flows involved or the current fair value of the instruments and, 
therefore, do not indicate the Bank’s exposure to credit or price risks. The following sections outline the nature and terms of 
the derivative transactions generally undertaken by the Bank. 
 
Interest rate contracts
Forward rate agreements give the buyer the ability to determine the underlying rate of interest for a specified period 
commencing on a specified future date (the settlement date). The underlying rate of interest could be an interest rate curve, 
interest rate index or bond yield. There is no exchange of principal and settlement is effected on the settlement date. The 
settlement amount is the difference between the contracted rate and the market rate prevailing on the settlement date 
discounted for the interest period of the agreement.
Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of interest obligations with the counterparty for a specified period without 
exchanging the underlying (or notional) principal.
Interest rate caps and floors give the buyer the ability to fix the maximum or minimum rate of interest. The writer of 
the contract pays the amount by which the market rate exceeds or is less than the cap rate or the floor rate respectively. 
A combination of interest rate caps and floors can create structures such as interest rate collar, cap spreads and floor spreads. 
Interest rate futures are standardised interest rate derivative contracts traded on a recognised stock exchange to buy or 
sell a notional security or any other interest bearing instrument or an index of such instruments or interest rates at a specified 
future date, at a price determined at the time of the contract.
 
Exchange rate contracts
Forward foreign exchange contracts are agreements to buy or sell fixed amounts of currency at an agreed exchange rate 
on a future date. These instruments are carried at fair value, determined based on either FEDAI rates or market quotations.
Cross currency swaps are agreements to exchange principal amounts denominated in different currencies. Cross currency 
swaps may also involve the exchange of interest payments on one specified currency for interest payments in another specified 
currency for a specified period.
Currency options (including Exchange Traded Currency Option) give the buyer, on payment of a premium, the right but 
not an obligation, to buy or sell specified amounts of currency at an agreed exchange rate on or before a specified future date. 
Currency futures contract is a standardised contract traded on an exchange, to buy or sell a certain underlying currency 
on a certain date in the future, at a specified price. The contract specifies the rate of exchange between one unit of currency 
with another.

Introduction to

Responsible 
Business
Statutory Reports and 
Financial Statements
The Bank’s derivative transactions relate to sales and trading activities. Sale activities include the structuring and marketing of 
derivatives to customers to enable them to hedge their market risks (both interest rate and exchange risks), within the regulatory 
framework as applicable from time to time. The Bank deals in derivatives on its own account (trading activity) principally for the 
purpose of generating a profit from short term fluctuations in price yields or implied volatility. The Bank also deals in derivatives 
to hedge the risk embedded in some of its Balance Sheet assets or liabilities.
 
Constituents involved in derivative business
The Treasury front-office enters into derivative transactions with customers and inter-bank counterparties. The Bank has an 
independent back-office and mid-office as per regulatory guidelines. The Bank has credit risk and market risk departments, as 
part of the Risk Management Group, that assesses counterparty credit risk and market risk limits, within the risk architecture 
and processes of the Bank.
 
Derivative policy
The Bank has in place a Derivative policy which covers various aspects that apply to the functioning of the derivative business. 
The derivative business is administered through various market risk limits such as position limits, tenor limits, sensitivity limits, 
scenario based profit and loss limit for option portfolio, stop loss trigger levels and value-at-risk limits that are recommended 
by the Risk Policy and Monitoring Committee (‘RPMC’) to the Board of Directors for approval. All methodologies that are used 
to assess market and credit risks for derivative transactions are specified by the credit risk and market risk units. Limits are 
monitored on a daily basis by the mid-office.
The Bank has a Board approved policy on Customer Suitability & Appropriateness, which forms part of the Derivative policy, to 
ensure that derivative transactions entered into are appropriate and suitable to the customer’s nature of business / operations. 
Before entering into a derivative deal with a customer, the Bank scores the customer on various risk parameters and based 
on the overall score level it determines the kind of product that best suits its risk appetite and the customer’s requirements.
 
Classification of derivatives book
The derivative book is classified into trading and hedging book. Classification of the derivative book is made on the basis of 
the definitions of the trading and hedging specified in the RBI guidelines. The trading book is managed within the trading limits 
recommended by the RPMC and approved by the Board of Directors.
 
Hedging policy
For derivative contracts designated as hedging instruments, the Bank documents, at inception of the hedge, the relationship 
between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, the risk management objective for undertaking the hedge and the 
methods used to assess the hedge effectiveness. Hedge effectiveness is ascertained at the time of inception of the hedge 
and periodically thereafter. Hedge effectiveness is measured by the degree to which changes in the fair value or cash flows 
of the hedged item that are attributable to a hedged risk are offset by changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedging 
instrument using various qualitative and quantitative methods.
The hedging book consists of transactions to hedge Balance Sheet assets or liabilities. The tenor of hedging instrument may be 
less than or equal to the tenor of underlying hedged asset or liability. The Bank as part of its risk management strategy, makes 
use of financial derivative instruments, including foreign exchange forward contracts, for hedging the risk embedded in some 
of its financial assets or liabilities recognised on the balance sheet. In case of a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value 
of the hedging instruments and hedged items are recognised in the Profit and Loss Account and in case of cash flow hedges 
other than for foreign exchange forward contracts, the changes in fair value of effective portion are recognised in Reserves 
and Surplus under ‘Cash flow hedge reserve’ and ineffective portion of an effective hedging relationship, if any, is recognised 
in the Profit and Loss Account. The accumulated balance in the cash flow hedge reserve, in an effective hedging relationship, 
is recycled in the Profit and Loss Account at the same time that the impact from the hedged item is recognised in the Profit 
and Loss Account. Foreign exchange forward contracts not intended for trading, that are entered into to establish the amount 
of reporting currency required or available at the settlement date of a transaction, and are outstanding at the Balance Sheet 
date, are effectively valued at the closing spot rate. The premia or discount arising at the inception of such forward exchange 
contract is amortised as expense or income over the life of the contract.
Provisioning, collateral and credit risk mitigation
The Bank enters into derivative transactions with counterparties based on their business ranking and financial position. 
The Bank sets up appropriate limits upon evaluating the ability of the counterparty to honour its obligations in the event of 

Schedules to the Financial Statements
For the year ended March 31, 2022
crystallisation of the exposure. Appropriate credit covenants are stipulated where required, as trigger events to call for collaterals 
or terminate a transaction and contain the risk. Further, to mitigate the current exposure in non-centrally cleared forex and 
derivative transactions, Bank has entered into Credit Support Annex (‘CSA’) agreements with some of the major international 
counterparty banks and few Indian financial institutions.
The Bank, at the minimum, conforms to the RBI guidelines with regard to provisioning requirements. Overdue receivables 
representing crystallised positive mark to market value of a derivative contract are transferred to the account of the borrower 
and treated as non-performing assets, if these remain unpaid for 90 days or more. Full provision is made for the entire amount 
of overdue and future receivables relating to positive marked to market value of non-performing derivative contracts.

funded interest term loans classified as NPA and provisions in lieu of diminution in the fair value of restructured assets.

 Provision coverage ratio does not include assets written-off.
 
The Honourable Supreme Court of India (Hon’ble SC), in a public interest litigation (Gajendra Sharma Vs. Union of 
India & Anr), vide an interim order dated September 03, 2020 (“Interim Order”), had directed banks that accounts 
which were not declared NPA till August 31, 2020 shall not be declared as NPA till further orders. Accordingly, the 
Bank did not classify any account which was not NPA as of August 31, 2020 as per the RBI IRAC norms, as NPA 
after August 31, 2020.
 
The Interim Order granted to not declare accounts as NPA stood vacated on March 23, 2021 vide the judgement of 
the Hon’ble SC in the matter of Small Scale Industrial Manufacturers Association vs. UOI & Ors. and other connected 
matters. In accordance with the instructions in paragraph 5 of the RBI circular dated April 07, 2021 issued in this 
connection, the Bank continued with the asset classification of borrower accounts as per the extant RBI instructions 
/ IRAC norms.
 Divergence in the asset classification and provisioning
 
In terms of the RBI guidelines, banks are required to disclose the divergence in asset classification and provisioning 
consequent to RBI’s annual supervisory process in their notes to accounts to the financial statements, wherever the 
additional provisioning assessed / additional gross NPAs identified by RBI exceeds the threshold specified by RBI. The 
threshold for provisioning is 10 per cent of the reported profit before provisions and contingencies for the reference period 
and that for additional gross NPAs is 15 per cent of the published incremental Gross NPAs for the reference period. 
 
There was no divergence in asset classification and provisioning for NPAs for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.

From the above, 58 loans aggregating to ` 11.45 crore was repurchased by the transferor in compliance with paragraph 
48 of Master Direction - RBI (Transfer of Loan Exposures) Directions, 2021.
 • The Bank has not acquired any Special Mention Account.
 • The RBI Master Direction on Transfer of Loan Exposures dated September 24, 2021 has mandated disclosure of 
transfer of loan assets. Considering the terms ‘loans not in default’ and ‘special mention account’ under this circular 
vis-a-vis loans termed as ‘standard’ as hitherto and the separate processes prescribed therein for transfer of such 
assets, the Bank believes that such disclosure would be more meaningful if disclosed prospectively and therefore 
transfer of loan exposures prior to September 24, 2021 including comparatives of previous year are not considered 
relevant for disclosure.
 • During the years ended March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021, there were no standard assets securitised-out by 
the Bank.

Contingent liability*
Brief description

Claims against the Bank 
not acknowledged as 
debts - taxation
The Bank is a party to various taxation matters in respect of which appeals are pending. The Bank 
expects the outcome of the appeals to be favorable based on decisions on similar issues in the 
previous years by the appellate authorities, based on the facts of the case and taxation laws. 

Claims against the Bank 
not acknowledged as 
debts - others
The Bank is a party to various legal proceedings in the normal course of business. The Bank does not 
expect the outcome of these proceedings to have a material adverse effect on the Bank’s financial 
conditions, results of operations or cash flows.

Partly paid investments
This represents amount remaining unpaid towards liability for partly paid investments.

Liability on account of 
forward exchange and 
derivative contracts
The Bank enters into foreign exchange contracts, currency options, forward rate agreements, currency 
swaps and interest rate swaps with inter-bank participants on its own account and for customers. 
Forward exchange contracts are commitments to buy or sell foreign currency at a future date at 
the contracted rate. Currency swaps are commitments to exchange cash flows by way of interest 
/ principal in one currency against another, based on predetermined rates. Interest rate swaps are 
commitments to exchange fixed and floating interest rate cash flows. The notional amounts of financial 
instruments such as foreign exchange contracts and derivatives provide a basis for comparison with 
instruments recognised on the Balance Sheet but do not necessarily indicate the amounts of future 
cash flows involved or the current fair value of the instruments and, therefore, do not indicate the 
Bank’s exposure to credit or price risks. The derivative instruments become favorable (assets) or 
unfavorable (liabilities) as a result of fluctuations in market rates or prices relative to their terms. 

Guarantees given on 
behalf of constituents, 
acceptances, 
endorsements and other 
obligations
As a part of its commercial banking activities, the Bank issues documentary credit and guarantees 
on behalf of its customers. Documentary credits such as letters of credit enhance the credit standing 
of the Bank’s customers. Guarantees generally represent irrevocable assurances that the Bank will 
make payments in the event of the customer failing to fulfill its financial or performance obligations.

Other items for which the 
Bank is contingently liable
These include: a) Credit enhancements in respect of securitised-out loans; b) Bills rediscounted by 
the Bank; c) Capital commitments; d) Underwriting commitments; e) Investment purchases pending 
settlement; f) Amount transferred to the RBI under the Depositor Education and Awareness Fund 
(DEAF).

Provident fund
 
The guidance note on AS-15, Employee Benefits, states that employer established provident funds, where interest is guaranteed 
are to be considered as defined benefit plans and the liability has to be valued. The Institute of Actuaries of India (IAI) has issued 
a guidance note on valuation of interest rate guarantees on exempt provident funds. The actuary has accordingly valued the 
same and the Bank held a provision of Nil as at March 31, 2022 (previous year: Nil), towards the present value of the guaranteed 
interest benefit obligation. The actuary has followed the deterministic approach as prescribed by the guidance note.

 Information relating to the design and structure of remuneration processes and the key features and 
objectives of remuneration policy
 
 
Key Features and Objectives of Remuneration Policy
 
The Bank’s Remuneration Policy (the ‘Policy’) is aligned to business strategy, market dynamics, internal characteristics 
and complexities within the Bank. The ultimate objective of the Policy is to provide a fair and transparent structure 
that helps in acquiring and retaining the talent pool critical to build competitive advantage and brand equity. The 
Policy has been designed basis the principles for sound compensation practices in accordance with regulatory 
requirements and provides a framework to create, modify and maintain appropriate compensation programs and 
processes with adequate supervision and control. 
 
The Bank’s performance management system provides a sound basis for assessing employee performance holistically. 
The Bank’s compensation framework is aligned with the performance management system and differentiates pay 
appropriately amongst its employees based on degree of contribution, performance, skill, experience, grade and 
availability of talent owing to competitive market forces. Further, the Bank also considers compliance to processes, 
regulatory compliance and risk management as an integral part of its performance appraisal process. These factors 
are given due weightage for the purposes of the final performance rating of employees for a given performance year.
 
The NRC considers the aforementioned principles enunciated in the Bank’s compensation policy and ensures that:
(a) the compensation is adjusted for all types of prudent risk taking; 
(b) compensation outcomes are symmetric with risk outcomes;
(c) compensation payouts are sensitive to the time horizon of risk; and 
(d) the mix of cash, equity and other forms of compensation are aligned with risk.

II. 
Design and Structure of Remuneration
 
The design and structure of remuneration in accordance with the RBI guidelines dated November 4, 2019, pertaining 
to the performance year 2020-2021 and the related payouts made in the financial year ended March 31, 2022 are 
as follows:
Fixed Pay
 
The Remuneration Policy ensures that the fixed component of the compensation is reasonable, taking into 
account all relevant factors including industry practice. 
 
Elements of Fixed Pay:
 
The fixed pay component of the Bank’s compensation structure typically consists of elements such as base 
salary, allowances, perquisites and retirement benefits. Perquisites extended are in the nature of company 
car, company leased accommodation, club membership and such other benefits or allowances in lieu of such 
perquisites / benefits. Retirement benefits include contributions to Provident Fund, Superannuation Fund 
(for employees above certain job bands), National Pension Scheme and Gratuity. The Bank also provides 
pension to certain employees of the erstwhile Lord Krishna Bank (eLKB) under the Indian Banks’ Association 
(‘IBA’) structure.
 
Determinants of Fixed Pay:
 
The fixed pay is primarily determined by taking into account factors such as the job size, performance, 
experience, location, market competitiveness of pay and is designed to meet the following key objectives of:
(a) fair compensation given the role complexity and size;
(b) fair compensation given the individual’s skill, competence, experience and market pay position; 
(c) contribution to post retirement benefits; and
(d) compliance with all statutory obligations.
 
The quantum of fixed pay for the Senior Management i.e. Employees in Executive Vice President and above 
grades, Material Risk Takers other than Whole Time Directors, Risk and Control Staff and Key Management 
Personnel are approved by the NRC and the Board. 
 
The quantum of fixed pay for Whole Time Directors is approved by the NRC and the Board, and is subject to 
the approval of the RBI.
Variable Pay - For Senior Management and Material Risk Takers
 
The performance management system forms the basis for variable pay allocation of the Bank. The Remuneration 
Policy of the Bank ensures that the performance management system is comprehensive and considers both, 
quantitative and qualitative performance measures. 
(i) Composition of Variable pay
 
The variable pay will be in the form of share linked instruments or a mix of cash and share linked instruments. 
The share linked instrument used in the financial year 2021-22 was the Employee Stock Options. All plans 
for grant of options are framed in accordance with the SEBI guidelines, 1999 as amended from time to 
time and are approved by the shareholders of the Bank. These plans provide for the grant of options post 
approval by the NRC. For Whole Time Directors the variable pay is approved by the NRC, Board and the 
Reserve Bank of India.
 
The Bank will ensure that there is a proper balance between Fixed Pay and Variable Pay. In cases where 
compensation by way of share-linked instruments is not permitted by law / regulations, the entire variable 
pay will be in cash. 
(ii) Limits on Variable pay
 
A substantial portion of compensation i.e. at least 50% will be variable and paid on the basis of individual, 
business unit and organization performance. This will be in line with the principle that, at higher levels 
of responsibility, the proportion of variable pay will be higher. The total variable pay shall be limited to a 
maximum of 300% of the fixed pay (for the relative performance period).

In case the variable pay is upto 200% of the fixed pay, a minimum of 50% of the variable pay; and in case 
the variable pay is above 200%, a minimum of 67% of the variable pay shall be via non-cash instruments. 
The non-cash component in 2021-22 comprised of Employee Stock Options.
 
In the event that the employee is barred by statute or regulation from grant of share-linked instruments, 
his / her variable pay will be capped at 150% of fixed pay but shall not be less than 50% of the fixed pay.
(iii) Deferral of Variable pay
 
For senior management including Whole Time Directors (WTDs) and Material Risk Takers (MRTs), deferral arrangements exists for the variable pay. A minimum of 60% of total variable pay is under deferral 
arrangements. If cash component is a part of the variable pay, at least 50% of the cash bonus is deferred. 
In cases where cash component of the bonus is under Rs 25 lakh, deferral arrangements is not necessary.
 
The deferral period is a minimum of three years and is applicable to both cash and non-cash components 
of variable pay. The deferral period for share linked instruments / ESOPs is governed by the ESOP Scheme 
Rules which is approved by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee and the Board. In 2021-22, 
the deferment of cash variable pay, where applicable, was 3 years in the case of cash variable pay and 4 
years (vesting period) in the case of Employee Stock Options.
(iv) Vesting of Variable Pay 
 
The deferred portion of the remuneration vests at the end of deferral period and is spread out over the 
course of the deferral period. The first vesting is not before one year from the commencement of the 
deferral period. The vesting is no faster than on a pro rata basis and the frequency of the vesting is more 
than a year in order to ensure appropriate assessment of risk. 
(v) Malus / Clawback Arrangement
 
The Bank believes in sustained business performance in tandem with prudent risk taking. The Bank, 
therefore, has devised appropriate deterrents in order to institutionalize the aforementioned commitment.
 
Malus Arrangement: The provision of a Malus arrangement would entail cancellation of payout for the 
deferred portion of reward (cash variable pay / long term incentive (LTI) i.e. any Share Linked Instrument). The 
RBI guidelines define Malus thus “A Malus arrangement permits the bank to prevent vesting of all or part of the 
amount of a deferred remuneration. Malus arrangement does not reverse vesting after it has already occurred”.
 
Clawback Arrangement: The provision of Clawback arrangement would entail return of payout of reward 
(cash variable pay / long term incentive (LTI) i.e. any Share Linked Instrument) made in the previous years 
attributable to a given reference year wherein the incident has occurred. The return would be in terms of 
net amount. The RBI guidelines define Clawback thus “A Clawback is a contractual agreement between the 
employee and the bank in which the employee agrees to return previously paid or vested remuneration to the 
bank under certain circumstances”.
 
The Malus and Clawback clause will be actioned when the employee demonstrates behaviour involving 
fraudulent behaviour, moral turpitude, lack of integrity, flagrant breach of company policies and statutory 
norms resulting in financial or non-financial losses. Manifestation of behaviour listed above is presumed to 
have a malafide intent. Illustrative list of conditions are enumerated below. The occurrence of any / some / all 
of the following conditions / events shall trigger a review by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee for 
the application of the Malus or the Clawback arrangement:
Substantial Financial Deterioration in profitability or risk parameters
Reckless, negligent or willful actions or exhibited inappropriate values and behavior
Fraud that requires a financial restatement
Reputational harm
Exposing the bank to substantial risk
Such other conditions or events, of similar nature as above, as determined by NRC for triggering review 
by NRC for the purpose of application of the Malus or the Clawback arrangement. 

Schedules to the Financial Statements
For the year ended March 31, 2022
 
In determining the causes for deterioration in financial performance under (a), the Nomination and Remuneration 
Committee may take into consideration and have due regard to the fact whether the deterioration was for factors 
within control or whether it was on account of conditions like global market headwinds, industry performance, 
changes in legal / regulatory regime, force majeure events like occurrence of natural disasters, pandemic, other 
socio-economic conditions, etc.
 
While undertaking the review for the concerned person for the application of the Malus or the Clawback 
arrangement based on any trigger events, when determining accountability of the concerned person, the 
Nomination and Remuneration Committee shall be guided by the principles of proportionality, culpability or 
proximity or nexus to the event or misconduct.
 
In accordance with the RBI guidelines, wherever the assessed divergence in bank’s provisioning for NonPerforming Assets (NPAs) or asset classification exceeds the prescribed threshold for public disclosure, the 
bank shall not pay the unvested portion of the variable compensation for the assessment year under ‘Malus’ 
arrangement. Further, in such situations, no proposal for increase in variable pay (for the assessment year) 
shall be entertained. In case the bank’s post assessment Gross NPAs are less than 2.0%, these restrictions 
will apply only if criteria for public disclosure are triggered either on account of divergence in provisioning or 
both provisioning and asset classification.
 
The NRC may decide to apply Malus on part, or all of the variable pay. The time horizon for the application of 
Malus / Clawback clause shall be four years from the date of reward.
 
The Nomination and Remuneration Committee shall review the act of misconduct / incident to ascertain the 
degree of accountability attributable to a Whole Time Director / Material Risk Taker / Senior Management (Job 
Bands C1 and above) prior to applying the Malus or Clawback arrangement.
 
The criteria for Malus / Clawback will be reviewed by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee annually.
(vi) Approval Process: 
 
The Variable Pay for Senior Management, Material Risk Takers other than Whole Time Directors, Risk 
and control staff is approved by the NRC and the Board. For Whole Time Directors the variable pay is 
approved by the NRC, Board and the Reserve Bank of India.
 
Employees other than Senior Management, Material Risk Takers, Whole Time Directors
 
The Bank has formulated the following variable pay plans:
(i) Annual Bonus Plan 
 
The quantum of variable payout is a function of the performance of the Bank, performance of the business unit, 
performance of the individual employee, job band of the employee and the functional category. Basis these 
key determinants and due adjustment for risk alignment, a payout matrix for variable pay is developed. Market 
trends for specific businesses / functions along with inputs from compensation surveys may also be used in 
finalising the payout. 
 
Bonus pools are designed to meet specific business needs therefore resulting in differentiation in both the 
quantum and the method of payout across functions. Typically higher levels of responsibility receive a higher 
proportion of variable pay vis-à-vis fixed pay. 
(ii) Performance-Linked Plans (PLPs) 
 
PLPs are formulated for employees in sales, collections, customer service and relationship roles who are given 
business / service targets but have limited impact on risk since credit decisions are exercised independent 
of these functions. All PLP payouts are based on a balanced scorecard framework which factors not just 
quantitative, but also qualitative measures, and are subject to achievement of individual targets enumerated in 
the respective scorecards of the employees. A portion of the PLP payouts is deferred till the end of the financial 
year to provide for any unforeseen performance risks. Employees who are on the PLPs are excluded from the 
Annual Bonus Plan.

(iii) Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOPs)
 
Employees in Job Bands D3 and above also receive ESOPs as a vehicle to create a balance between short 
term rewards and long term sustainable value creation. ESOPs play a key role in the attraction and retention 
of key talent. 
 
The NRC grants options after considering parameters such as the incumbent’s grade and performance rating, 
and such other factors as may be deemed appropriate by the NRC. 
 
All plans for grant of options are framed in accordance with the SEBI guidelines, 1999 as amended from time 
to time and are approved by the shareholders of the Bank. These plans provide for the grant of options post 
approval by the NRC.
 
The Bank grants ESOPs to eligible employees. Such ESOPs vest over four tranches spread over a period of 
48 months. 
 
In accordance with the RBI guidelines, Employee Stock Options is included as part of Variable Pay.
 
Risk, Control and Compliance Staff
 
The Bank has separated the Risk, Control and Compliance functions from the Business functions in order 
to create a strong culture of checks and balances and to eliminate any possible conflict of interest between 
revenue generation and risk management and control. Accordingly, the overall variable pay as well as the 
annual salary increment of the employees in the Risk, Control and Compliance functions is based on their 
performance, functional objectives and goals. The Bank ensures that the mix of fixed to variable compensation 
for these functions is weighted in favour of fixed compensation. 
 
Guaranteed Bonus
 
Guaranteed Bonuses are not consistent with sound risk management or pay for performance principles of the 
Bank and therefore do not form an integral part of the general compensation practice. 
 
For critical hiring for some select strategic roles, the Bank may consider granting of bonus, based on the 
performance rating upon confirmation, as a prudent way to avoid loading the entire cost of attraction into the 
fixed component of the compensation which could have a long term cost implication for the Bank. For such 
hiring, the said bonus is generally decided by taking into account appropriate risk factors and market conditions. 
 
For hiring at levels of Whole Time Directors / Managing Director / Material Risk Takers and certain employees 
in select strategic roles, a signon bonus, if any, is limited to the first year only and would be in the form of 
Employee Stock Options.
 
Severance Pay
 
The Bank does not grant severance pay other than accrued benefits (such as gratuity, pension) except in cases 
where it is mandated by any statute. 
 
Hedging
 
The Bank does not provide any facility or fund or permit its Whole Time Directors and employees to insure or hedge 
their compensation structure to offset the risk alignment effects embedded in their compensation arrangement. 
 
Statutory Bonus
 
Some employees are also paid statutory bonus as per the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965 as amended from time 
to time.
 
 
III. Remuneration Processes
 
Fitment at the time of Hire
 
Pay scales at the Bank are set basis the job size, experience, location and the academic and professional credentials 
of the incumbent. 
 
The compensation of new hires is in line with the existing pay ranges and consistent with the compensation levels of 
the existing employees of the Bank at similar profiles. The pay ranges are subject to change basis market trends and 
the Bank’s talent management priorities. While the Bank believes in the internal equity and parity as a key determinant 

Schedules to the Financial Statements
For the year ended March 31, 2022
of pay, it does acknowledge the external competitive pressures of the talent market. Accordingly, there could be 
certain key profiles with critical competencies which may be hired at a premium and treated as an exception to the 
overall pay philosophy. Any deviation from the defined pay ranges is treated as a hiring exception requiring approval 
with appropriate justification.
 
Pay Increment / Pay Revision
 
The Bank strives to ensure external competitiveness as well as internal equity without diluting the overall focus on 
optimising cost. In order to enhance the Bank’s external competitiveness, it participates in an annual salary survey of 
the banking sector to understand key market trends as well as get insights on relative market pay position compared 
to peers. The Bank endeavors to ensure that most employees progress to the median of the market in terms of 
fixed pay over time. This coupled with key internal data indicators like performance score, job family, experience, 
job grade and salary budget form the basis of decision making on revisions in fixed pay. 
 
Increments in fixed pay for majority of the employee population are generally undertaken once every financial year. 
However, promotions, confirmations and change in job dimensions could also lead to a change in the fixed pay 
during other times of the financial year.
 
The Bank also makes salary corrections and adjustments during the financial year for competitive pay positioning 
for the purpose of retention of critical skills in the domain of Information Technology, Digital, Information Security, 
Data Science as well as business segments that are strategic focus areas of the bank. However, such pay revisions 
are done on an exception basis.
 
The Fixed Pay for the Material Risk Takers (other than Whole Time Directors), Senior Management, Key Management 
Personnel is approved by the NRC and the Board. The Fixed Pay for the Whole Time Directors is approved by the 
NRC, Board and the Reserve Bank of India.
Description of the ways in which current and future risks are taken into account in the remuneration 
processes, including the nature and type of the key measures used to take account of these risks
 
The Bank takes into account various types of risks in its remuneration processes. The Bank follows a comprehensive 
framework that includes within its ambit the key dimensions of remuneration such as fixed pay, variable pay and long 
term incentives (i.e. Employee Stock Options). 
 
Fixed pay: The Bank conducts a comprehensive market benchmarking study to ensure that employees are competitively 
positioned in terms of fixed pay. The Bank follows a robust salary review process wherein revisions in fixed compensation 
are based on performance. The Bank also makes salary adjustments taking into consideration pay positioning of 
employees vis-à-vis market reference points. Through this approach the Bank endeavors to ensure that the talent risk 
due to attrition is mitigated. Fixed pay could be revised downwards as well, in the event of certain proven cases of 
misconduct by an employee.
 
Variable pay: The Bank has distinct types of variable pay plans as given below:
 
 
(a) 
Quarterly / monthly performance-linked pay (PLP) plans:
 
All quarterly / monthly PLP plans are based on the principle of balanced scorecard framework that includes within 
its ambit both quantitative and qualitative factors including key strategic objectives that ensure future competitive 
advantage for the Bank. PLP plans, by design, have deterrents that play a role of moderating payouts based on the 
non-fulfillment of established quantitative / qualitative risk factors. Deterrents also include risks arising out of noncompliance, mis-sell etc. Further, a portion of all payouts under the PLP plans is deferred till the end of the financial 
year to provide for any unforeseen performance risks. Employees who are part of the PLP plans are excluded from 
the Annual Bonus Plan.
 
 
(b) 
Variable Pay:
 
The Bank takes into consideration the fact that a portion of the Bank’s profits are directly attributable to various 
types of risks the Bank is exposed to such as credit risk and market risk.

The framework developed by the Bank in order to arrive at the quantum of bonus pool is based on the performance 
of the Bank and profitability. The annual variable pay is distributed based on business unit and individual performance 
and job band and role of the individual for non-business functions. The business unit performance is based on 
factors such as growth in revenue, growth in profit, cost to income ratio and achievement vis-à-vis plans and key 
objectives. Bonus pay out for an individual employee in a particular grade is linked to the performance rating of the 
employee and subject to meeting the Bank’s standards of ethical conduct. 
 
The Bank has devised appropriate Malus and Clawback clauses as a risk mitigant for Whole Time Directors, 
Material Risk Takers, Senior Management (i.e. Employees in the job Bands of Executive Vice President and above). 
Under the Malus clause the incumbent could forego the vesting of the deferred variable pay in full or in part. Under 
the Clawback clause the incumbent is obligated to return all the tranches of variable pay payout pertaining to 
the reference performance year. The deferred variable pay is paid out post review and approval by the NRC and 
the Board.
Description of the ways in which the Bank seeks to link performance during a performance measurement 
period with levels of remuneration
 
The Bank has a robust performance management system for evaluating the performance of its Whole Time Directors. 
The performance appraisal system is based on a Balanced Scorecard Framework and considers qualitative as well as 
quantitative factors of performance which includes the following parameters:
Business Performance - This includes business growth, profitability, asset quality and shareholder value
Stakeholder Relationship - This includes net promoter score and corporate social responsibility
Audit and Compliance - This includes internal audit reports and compliance with the regulations and 
inspection reports
Digital Transformation - This includes performance on initiatives required to run the bank and grow the bank
Organizational Excellence - This includes succession planning and employee engagement
 
While the above parameters form the core evaluation parameters for the Bank and the remuneration of its Whole Time 
Directors, each of the business units are measured on the following from a remuneration standpoint:
Increase in plan over the previous year;
Actual growth in revenue over previous year;
Growth in net revenue (%);
Achievement of net revenue against plan (%);
Actual profit before tax; 
Growth in profit before tax compared to the previous year; 
Improvement in cost to income over the previous year; and
Achievement of key strategic objectives.
 
The process by which levels of remuneration in the Bank are aligned to the performance of the Bank, business unit and 
individual employees is articulated below:
 
Fixed Pay
 
The Bank reviews the fixed pay portion of the compensation structure basis merit-based increments and market 
corrections. These are based on a combination of performance rating, job band and the functional category of the 
individual employee. For a given job band, the merit increment is directly related to the performance rating. The Bank 
strives to ensure that most employees progress to the median of the market in terms of fixed pay over time. All other 
things remaining equal, the correction percentage is directly related to the performance rating of the individual.
 
Variable Pay
 
Basis the performance of the business unit, individual performance and role, the Bank has formulated the following 
variable pay plans: 
Variable Pay Plans:
 
For Employees in Job Bands of Vice President and above (includes employees in Senior Management, 
Material Risk Takers, Whole Time Directors) the variable Pay intends to reward short term as well as long term 
sustained performance of the bank and shareholder value creation.

Schedules to the Financial Statements
For the year ended March 31, 2022
 
Short term Performance: Short term performance is realised in the form of cash variable pay. The cash variable 
pay is based on performance rating and the job band of the individual and is further enhanced or moderated by the 
business performance multiplier and role. The cash variable pay is computed on the gross salary. 
 
Long term Performance: Employee Stock options are granted to employees based on their performance rating 
and Job band and the value of the same is realised vide long term performance of the bank and creation of 
shareholder value. 
 
For Employees in Job Bands below Vice President:
 
At these levels the variable pay is in the form of Cash variable pay only and is based on the Annual performance. 
The Bank’s annual bonus is computed as a percentage of the gross salary for every job band. The bonus multiple 
is based on performance of the business unit (based on the parameters above), performance rating, job band and 
the functional category of the individual employee. The business performance category determines the multiplier for 
the bonus. All other things remaining equal, for a given job band, the bonus is directly related to the performance 
rating. Employees who are part of the annual cash Variable Pay plan are not part of the Performance Linked Plans 
mentioned below.
Performance-linked Plans (PLPs)
 
The Bank has formulated PLPs for its sales, collections, customer service and relationship roles who are given 
sales, collections and service targets basis a balanced scorecard methodology. All PLP payouts are subject to the 
achievement of individual targets enumerated in the respective scorecards of the employees and moderated by 
qualitative parameters. A portion of the PLP payouts is deferred till the end of the financial year to provide for any 
unforeseen performance risks. All PLPs are based on a balanced scorecard framework and, depending on the plan, 
could be paid out monthly or quarterly.
Description of the ways in which the Bank seeks to adjust remuneration to take account of the longer term 
performance
 
 For employees in Senior Management, Material Risk Takers and Whole Time Directors the Bank seeks to adjust 
remuneration to take account of the longer term performance in the following way.
(i) 
Limits on variable pay
 
A substantial portion of compensation i.e. at least 50% will be variable and paid on the basis of individual, business 
unit and organization performance. This will be in line with the principle that, at higher levels of responsibility, the 
proportion of variable pay will be higher. The total variable pay shall be limited to a maximum of 300% of the fixed pay.
 
In case the variable pay is upto 200% of the fixed pay, a minimum of 50% of the variable pay; and in case the 
variable pay is above 200%, a minimum of 67% of the variable pay shall be via non-cash instruments. The non-cash 
component in 2021-22 comprised of Employee Stock Options.
 
In the event that the employee is barred by statute or regulation from grant of share-linked instruments, his / her 
variable pay will be capped at 150% of fixed pay but shall not be less than 50% of the fixed pay.
(ii) Deferral of variable pay
 
For senior management including Whole Time Directors (WTDs) and Material Risk Takers (MRTs), deferral arrangements 
will exist for the variable pay. A minimum of 60% of total variable pay will be under deferral arrangements. If cash 
component is a part of the variable pay, at least 50% of the cash bonus shall be deferred. In cases where cash 
component of the bonus is under Rs 25 lakh, deferral arrangements would not be necessary.
 
The deferral period would be a minimum of three years and will be applicable to both cash and non-cash components 
of variable pay. The deferral period for share linked instruments / ESOPs will be governed by the ESOP Scheme Rules 
which will be approved by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee and the Board. In 2021-22 the deferment 
of cash variable pay, where applicable, was 3 years in the case of cash variable pay and 4 years (vesting period) in 
the case of Employee Stock Options.
(iii) Vesting of Variable Pay 
 
The deferred portion of the remuneration will vest at the end of deferral period and will be spread out over the course 
of the deferral period. The first vesting would not be before one year from the commencement of the deferral period.

The vesting would be no faster than on a pro rata basis and the frequency of the vesting would be more than a year 
in order to ensure appropriate assessment of risk. 
(iv) Malus / Clawback Arrangement:
 
The Bank believes in sustained business performance in tandem with prudent risk taking. The Bank, therefore, has 
devised appropriate deterrents in order to institutionalize the aforementioned commitment.
 
Malus Arrangement: The provision of a Malus arrangement would entail cancellation of payout for the deferred portion 
of reward (cash variable pay / long term incentive (LTI) i.e. any Share Linked Instrument). The RBI guidelines define Malus 
thus “A Malus arrangement permits the bank to prevent vesting of all or part of the amount of a deferred remuneration. 
Malus arrangement does not reverse vesting after it has already occurred”.
 
Clawback Arrangement: The provision of Clawback arrangement would entail return of payout of reward (cash variable 
pay / long term incentive (LTI) i.e. any Share Linked Instrument) made in the previous years attributable to a given reference 
year wherein the incident has occurred. The return would be in terms of net amount. The RBI guidelines define Clawback 
thus “A Clawback is a contractual agreement between the employee and the bank in which the employee agrees to 
return previously paid or vested remuneration to the bank under certain circumstances”.
 
The Malus and Clawback clause will be actioned when the employee demonstrates behaviour involving fraudulent 
behaviour, moral turpitude, lack of integrity, flagrant breach of company policies and statutory norms resulting in financial 
or non-financial losses. Manifestation of behaviour listed above is presumed to have a malafide intent. Illustrative list of 
conditions are enumerated below. The occurrence of any / some / all of the following conditions / events shall trigger a 
review by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee for the application of the Malus or the Clawback arrangement:
Substantial Financial Deterioration in profitability or risk parameters
Reckless, negligent or willful actions or exhibited inappropriate values and behavior
Fraud that requires a financial restatement
Reputational harm
Exposing the bank to substantial risk
Such other conditions or events, of similar nature as above, as determined by NRC for triggering review by NRC for 
the purpose of application of the Malus or the Clawback arrangement.
 
In determining the causes for deterioration in financial performance under (a), the Nomination and Remuneration Committee 
may take into consideration and have due regard to the fact whether the deterioration was for factors within control or 
whether it was on account of conditions like global market headwinds, industry performance, changes in legal / regulatory 
regime, force majeure events like occurrence of natural disasters, pandemic, other socio-economic conditions etc.
 
While undertaking the review for the concerned person for the application of the Malus or the Clawback arrangement 
based on any trigger events, when determining accountability of the concerned person, the Nomination and Remuneration 
Committee shall be guided by the principles of proportionality, culpability or proximity or nexus to the event or misconduct.
 
In accordance with the RBI guidelines, wherever the assessed divergence in bank’s provisioning for Non-Performing 
Assets (NPAs) or asset classification exceeds the prescribed threshold for public disclosure, the bank shall not pay the 
unvested portion of the variable compensation for the assessment year under ‘Malus’ arrangement. Further, in such 
situations, no proposal for increase in variable pay (for the assessment year) shall be entertained. In case the bank’s post 
assessment Gross NPAs are less than 2.0%, these restrictions will apply only if criteria for public disclosure are triggered 
either on account of divergence in provisioning or both provisioning and asset classification.
 
The NRC may decide to apply Malus on part, or all of the unvested deferred Variable pay. The time horizon for the 
application of Malus / Clawback clause shall be four years from the date of reward.
 
The Nomination and Remuneration Committee shall review the act of misconduct / incident to ascertain the degree of 
accountability attributable to a Whole Time Director / Material Risk Taker / Senior Management (C1 and above) prior to 
applying the Malus or Clawback arrangement.
 
The criteria for Malus / Clawback will be reviewed by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee annually.

Schedules to the Financial Statements
For the year ended March 31, 2022
 
Employees other than Whole Time Directors, Material Risk Takers and Senior Management
The Bank has formulated the following variable pay plans:
Annual Cash Variable Pay plan:
 
The quantum of variable payout is a function of the performance of the Bank, performance of the individual employee, job 
band of the employee and the functional category. Basis these key determinants and due adjustment for risk alignment, 
a payout matrix for variable pay is developed. Market trends for specific businesses / functions along with inputs from 
compensation surveys may also be used in finalising the payout. 
 
Bonus pools are designed to meet specific business needs therefore resulting in differentiation in both the quantum and 
the method of payout across functions. Typically higher levels of responsibility receive a higher proportion of variable pay 
vis-à-vis fixed pay. 
 
For Employees in Job Bands of Vice President and above the variable Pay intends to reward short term as well as 
long term sustained performance of the bank and shareholder value creation.
 
Short term Performance: Short term performance is realised in the form of cash variable pay. The cash variable pay is 
based on performance rating and the job band of the individual and is further enhanced or moderated by the business 
performance multiplier and role. The cash variable pay is computed on the gross salary. 
 
Long term Performance: Employee Stock options are granted to employees based on their performance rating and 
Job band and the value of the same is realised vide long term performance of the Bank and creation of shareholder value. 
The vesting period for Employee Stock Option is 4 years.
Performance-linked Plans (PLPs)
 
The Bank has formulated PLPs for its sales, collections, customer service and relationship roles who are given sales, 
collections and service targets basis a balanced scorecard methodology. All PLP payouts are subject to the achievement 
of individual targets enumerated in the respective scorecards of the employees and moderated by qualitative parameters. 
A portion of the PLP payouts is deferred till the end of the financial year to provide for any unforeseen performance 
risks. All PLPs are based on a balanced scorecard framework and, depending on the plan, could be paid out monthly 
or quarterly.
Description of the different forms of variable remuneration (i.e. cash, shares, ESOPs and other forms) that 
the Bank utilises and the rationale for using these different forms
 
The Bank recognises the importance of variable pay in reinforcing a pay for performance culture. Variable pay stimulates 
employees to stretch their abilities to exceed expectations.
Annual Cash Variable Pay
 
These are paid to reward performance for a given financial year. This covers all employees (excluding employees 
under PLPs). This is based on performance of the business unit, performance rating, job band and functional 
category of the individual. For higher job bands the proportion of variable pay to total compensation tends to be 
higher. For Material Risk Takers, Senior Management and Whole Time Directors 50% of the cash variable pay is 
deferred over 3 years in the event the cash variable pay exceeds 25 lakhs.
Performance-linked Plans (PLPs)
 
The Bank has formulated PLPs for its sales, collections, customer service and relationship roles who are given 
sales, collections and service targets basis a balanced scorecard methodology. All PLP payouts are subject to the 
achievement of individual targets enumerated in the respective scorecards of the employees and moderated by 
qualitative parameters. A portion of the PLP payouts is deferred till the end of the financial year to provide for any 
unforeseen performance risks. All PLPs are based on a balanced scorecard framework and, depending on the plan, 
could be paid out monthly or quarterly.
Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP)
 
This is to reward for contribution of employees in creating a long term, sustainable earnings and enhancing 
shareholder value. Only employees in a certain job band and with a specific performance rating are eligible for 
stock options. Performance is the key criteria for granting stock options.

Qualitative disclosure on LCR
The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) is one of the Basel Committee’s key reforms to develop a more resilient banking sector. 
The objective of the LCR is to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banks. It does this by ensuring 
that banks have an adequate stock of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) that can be converted easily and 
immediately into cash to meet their liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario. The LCR is expected to

improve the banking sector’s ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress, whatever the source, thus 
reducing the risk of spillover from the financial sector to the real economy.
The Liquidity Risk Management of the Bank is governed by the Asset Liability Management (ALM) Policy approved by the Board. 
The Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) is a decision making unit responsible for implementing the liquidity and interest rate risk 
management strategy of the Bank in line with its risk management objectives and ensures adherence to the risk tolerance / 
limits set by the Board. In order to determine cash outflows, the Bank segregates its deposits into various customer segments, 
viz. Retail (which include deposits from individuals), Small Business Customers (those with deposits upto ` 7.5 crore), and 
Wholesale (which would cover all residual deposits). Within Wholesale, deposits that are attributable to clearing, custody, and 
cash management services are classified as Operational Deposits. Other contractual funding, including a portion of other 
liabilities which are expected to run down in a 30 day time frame are included in the cash outflows. These classifications, based 
on extant regulatory guidelines, are part of the Bank’s LCR framework, and are also submitted to the RBI.
The LCR is calculated by dividing a Bank's stock of HQLA by its total net cash outflows over a 30 day stress period. The 
guidelines for LCR were effective January 1, 2015, with the minimum requirement at 60% which have risen in equal annual 
steps to reach 100% on January 1, 2019. This graduated approach was designed to ensure that the LCR could be introduced 
without material disruption to the orderly strengthening of banking systems or the ongoing financing of economic activity. The 
present requirement, as on March 31, 2022 is 100%.
In the Indian context, the run-off factors for the stressed scenarios are prescribed by the RBI, for various categories of liabilities 
(viz., deposits, unsecured and secured wholesale borrowings), undrawn commitments, derivative-related exposures, and 
offset with inflows emanating from assets maturing within the same time period. Given below is a table of run-off factors and 
the average LCR maintained by the Bank quarter-wise over the past two years:

The average LCR for the quarter ended March 31, 2022 was at 111.89% as against 137.24% for the quarter ended March 31, 
2021, and above the present prescribed minimum requirement of 100%. The average HQLA for the quarter ended March 31, 
2022 was ` 385,997.51 crore, as against ` 387,444.92 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2021. During the same period 
the composition of government securities and treasury bills in the HQLA was at 89.04% as compared to 89.49% in the 
previous year.
 
For the quarter ended March 31, 2022, derivative exposures (net of cash inflows) / collateral requirements and undrawn 
commitments constituted just about 0.58% and 2.51% respectively of average cash outflow. The Bank has consistently 
maintained a robust funding profile with a significant portion of funding through deposits. As of March 31, 2022 the top 20 
depositors comprised of 4% of total deposits indicating a healthy and stable deposit profile.

39. Implementation of IFRS converged Indian Accounting Standards 
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs, in its press release dated January 18, 2016, had issued a roadmap for implementation of 
Indian Accounting Standards (IND-AS) for scheduled commercial banks, insurers / insurance companies and non-banking 
financial companies, which was subsequently confirmed by the RBI through its circular dated February 11, 2016. This roadmap 
required these institutions to prepare IND-AS based financial statements for the accounting periods beginning April 1, 2018 
with comparatives for the periods beginning April 1, 2017. The implementation of IND-AS by banks requires certain legislative 
changes in the format of financial statements to comply with the disclosures required under IND-AS. In April 2018, the RBI 
deferred the implementation of IND-AS by a year by when the necessary legislative amendments were expected. The legislative 

Schedules to the Financial Statements
For the year ended March 31, 2022
amendments recommended by the RBI are under consideration by the Government of India. Accordingly, the RBI, through 
its circular dated March 22, 2019, deferred the implementation of IND-AS until further notice. 
The Bank, being an associate of Housing Development Finance Corporation Limited (the ‘Corporation’), submits its consolidated 
financial information (‘fit for consolidation information’), prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement 
principles of IND-AS as specified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, to the Corporation for the purposes of 
the consolidated financial statements / results of the Corporation. The results of the Bank upon its first time adoption of and 
transition to IND-AS, based on the updated regulations and accounting standards / guidance and business strategy at the 
date of actual transition, could differ from those reported in the fit for consolidation information.
40. COVID-19
The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic had led to a nation-wide lockdown in April-May 2020. This was followed by localised 
lockdowns in areas with a significant number of COVID-19 cases. Following the easing of lockdown measures, there was an 
improvement in economic activity in the second half of fiscal 2021. Since then India experienced two waves of the COVID-19 
pandemic following the discovery of mutant coronavirus variants, leading to the reimposition of regional lockdowns which 
were subsequently lifted. 
The impact of COVID-19, including changes in customer behaviour and pandemic fears, as well as restrictions on business 
and individual activities, led to significant volatility in global and Indian financial markets and a significant decrease in global and 
local economic activities. The disruptions following the outbreak, impacted loan originations, the sale of third party products, 
the use of credit and debit cards by customers and the efficiency in collection efforts resulting in increase in customer defaults 
and consequent increase in provisions there against.
India is emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent to which any new wave of COVID-19 will impact the Bank's results 
will depend on ongoing as well as future developments, including, among other things, any new information concerning the 
severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any action to contain its spread or mitigate its impact whether government mandated 
or elected by us.
41. Refund / Adjustment of ‘interest on interest’
In accordance with the instructions in the paragraph 5 of the RBI circular dated April 07, 2021, the Bank refunded / adjusted 
'interest on interest' of ` 268.09 crore to all eligible borrowers during the year ended March 31, 2022.
42. Disclosure under Rule 11 (e) of the Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014
The Bank, as part of its normal banking business, grants loans and advances to its constituents including foreign entities with 
permission to lend / invest / provide guarantee or security or the like in other entities identified by such constituents. Similarly, 
the Bank accepts deposits from its constituents, who may instruct the Bank to lend / invest / provide guarantee or security 
or the like against such deposit in other entities identified by such constituents.

Independent Auditor's Report
To the Members of HDFC Bank Limited
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of HDFC Bank Limited (hereinafter referred to as the “Bank”) 
and its subsidiaries (the Bank and its subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”), which comprise the consolidated Balance 
Sheet as at March 31, 2022, the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year 
then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as “the consolidated financial statements”). 
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, based on consideration of reports 
of other auditors on separate financial statements and on the other financial information of subsidiaries, the aforesaid consolidated 
financial statements give the information required by the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 as well as the Companies Act, 2013 (“the 
Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Accounting Standards prescribed under section 
133 of the Act read with Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in 
India, of their consolidated state of affairs of the Group as at March 31, 2022, of consolidated profit and its consolidated cash flows 
for the year then ended.
Basis for Opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. 
Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are 
relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in India in terms of Code of Ethics issued by Institute of Chartered 
Accountant of India (“ICAI”), and the relevant provisions of the Act and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our opinion. 
Key Audit Matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2022. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Identification of Non - Performing advances (NPA) and provision on advances
Key Audit Matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
The Reserve Bank of India’s (“RBI”) guidelines on Income recognition, 
asset classification and provisioning (“IRACP”) prescribe the prudential 
norms for identification and classification of non-performing assets 
(“NPA”) and the minimum provision required for such assets.
The Bank is required to have Board approved policy as per IRACP 
guidelines for NPA identification and provision. 
The Bank is also required to apply its judgement to determine 
the identification and provision required against NPAs by applying 
quantitative as well as qualitative factors. The risk of identification of 
NPAs is affected by factors like stress and liquidity concerns in certain 
sectors. 
The provision on NPA is estimated based on ageing and classification 
of NPAs, recovery estimates, nature of loan product, value of security 
and other qualitative factors and is subject to the minimum provisioning 
norms specified by RBI and approved policy of the Bank in this regard. 
Additionally, the Bank makes provisions on exposures that are not 
classified as NPAs including advances to certain sectors and identified 
advances or group advances that can potentially slip into NPA. These 
are classiﬁed as contingency provisions.
The Management of the Bank also makes an assessment of the impact 
on borrowers’ accounts which were restructured as per RBI Circulars 
issued to provide relief to the borrowers. 
Since the identification of NPAs and provisioning for advances require 
significant level of estimation and given its significance to the overall 
audit including possible observation by RBI which could result into 
disclosure in the financial statements, we have ascertained identification 
and provisioning for NPAs as a key audit matter.
Tested the design and operating effectiveness of key controls (including 
application controls) over approval, recording, monitoring and recovery 
of loans, monitoring overdue / stressed accounts, identification of NPA, 
provision for NPA and valuation of security including collateral. 
Testing of Application controls include testing of automated controls, 
reports and system reconciliations.
Evaluated the governance process and tested controls over calculations 
of provision on non-performing advances, basis of provisioning in 
accordance with the Board approved policy.
Selected the borrowers based on quantitative and qualitative risk factors 
for their assessment of appropriate classification as NPA including 
computation of overdue ageing to assess its correct classification and 
provision amount as per extant IRACP norms and Bank policy. 
Performed other substantive procedures including but not limited to 
the following:
• Selected samples of performing loans and assessed independently 
as to whether those should be classified as NPA;
• For samples selected examined the security valuation, financial 
statements and other qualitative information;
• Considered the accounts reported by the Bank and other Banks as 
Special Mention Accounts (“SMA”) in RBI’s Central Repository of 
Information on Large Credits (CRILC) to identify stress;
• For selected samples assessed independently accounts that can 
potentially be classified as NPA and Red Flagged Accounts;
• Performed inquiries with the credit and risk departments to ascertain 
if there were indicators of stress or an occurrence of an event of 
default in a particular loan account or any product category which 
needed to be considered as NPA;
• Held specific discussions with the management of the Bank on 
sectors where there is perceived credit risk and the steps taken to 
mitigate the risks to identified sectors;
• Selected and tested samples of accounts which were restructured 
under MSME restructuring circular and Resolution Framework for 
COVID-19 related stress circular for their compliance with the RBI 
directions;
• Assessed the adequacy of disclosures against the relevant 
accounting standards and RBI requirements relating to NPAs.

The Bank has material open tax litigations which involve significant 
judgement to determine the possible outcome of these disputes.
Significant management judgement is needed in determining whether 
an obligation exists and whether a provision should be recognised as 
at the reporting date, in accordance with the accounting criteria set 
under Accounting Standard 29 - Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and 
Contingent Assets (‘AS 29’), or whether it needs to be disclosed as a 
contingent liability. Further significant judgements are also involved in 
measuring such obligations, the most significant of which are:
• Assessment of liability: Judgement is involved in the determination 
of whether an outflow in respect of identified material matters are 
probable and can be estimated reliably;
• Adequacy of provisions: The appropriateness of assumptions and 
judgements used in the estimation of significant provisions; and
• Adequacy of disclosures of provision for liabilities and charges, and 
contingent liabilities.
The Bank’s assessment is supported by the facts of matter, their own 
judgement, experience, and advices from legal and independent tax 
consultants wherever considered necessary. 
Since the assessment of these open tax litigations requires significant 
level of judgement in interpretation of law, we have included this as a 
key audit matter.
Our Audit procedures with respect to this matter included:
Testing the design and operating effectiveness of the Bank’s key 
controls over the estimation, monitoring and disclosure of provisions 
and contingent liabilities.
Our substantive audit procedures included and were not limited to the 
following:
• Obtained an understanding of the Bank’s process for determining 
tax liabilities, tax provisions and contingent liabilities pertaining to 
legal matters and taxation matters;
• Obtained list of cases/matters in respect of which litigations were 
outstanding as at reporting date;
• For significant legal matters, we sought external confirmations and 
also corroborated with management’s documented conclusions on 
the assessment of outstanding litigations against the Bank;
• For significant taxation matters, we involved our tax specialist to gain 
an understanding of the current status of the litigations, including 
understanding of various orders / notices received by the Bank and 
the management’s grounds of appeals before the relevant appellate 
authorities;
• Evaluated the merit of the subject matter under consideration 
with reference to the grounds presented therein and available 
independent legal / tax advice; and
• Agreed underlying tax balances to supporting documentation, 
including correspondence with tax authorities.
• Assessed the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.

Information Technology (“IT”) Systems and Controls 
Key Audit Matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
The Bank has a complex IT architecture to support its day-to-day 
business operations. High volume of transactions are processed and 
recorded on single or multiple applications. 
The reliability and security of IT systems plays a key role in the business 
operations of the Bank. Since large volume of transactions are 
processed daily, the IT controls are required to ensure that applications 
process data as expected and that changes are made in an appropriate 
manner. 
Appropriate IT general controls and application controls are required to 
ensure that such IT systems are able to process the data, as required, 
completely, accurately and consistently for reliable financial reporting. 
We have identified ‘IT systems and controls’ as key audit matter because 
of the high level automation, significant number of systems being used 
by the management and the complexity of the IT architecture and its 
impact on the financial reporting system. 
Our Audit procedures with respect to this matter included:
For testing the IT general controls, application controls and IT dependent 
manual controls, we involved specialists as part of the audit. The team 
also assisted in testing the accuracy of the information produced by the 
Bank’s IT systems. 
Obtained 
comprehensive 
understanding 
applications 
implemented at the Bank. It was followed by process understanding, 
mapping of applications to the same and understanding financial risks 
posed by people-process and technology. 
Key IT audit procedures includes testing design and operating 
effectiveness of  key controls operating over user access management 
(which includes user access provisioning, de-provisioning, access 
review, password configuration review, segregation of duties and 
privilege access), change management (which include change release 
in production environment are compliant to the defined procedures 
and segregation of environment is ensured), program development 
(which include review of data migration activity),  computer operations 
(which includes testing of key controls pertaining to Backup, Batch 
processing (including interface testing), incident management and data 
centre security), System interface controls. This included testing that 
requests for access to systems were appropriately logged, reviewed 
and authorized.
In addition to the above, the design and operating effectiveness of 
certain automated controls, that were considered as key internal system 
controls over financial reporting were tested. Using various techniques 
such as inquiry, review of documentation / record / reports, observation 
and re-performance. We also tested few controls using negative testing 
technique. We had taken adequate samples of instances for our test. 
Tested compensating controls and performed alternate procedures, 
where necessary. In addition, understood where relevant, changes 
made to the IT landscape during the audit period. 
Information Other than the Consolidated Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Bank’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information in the Basel 
III - Pillar 3 disclosures and graphical representation of financial highlights (but does not include the financial statements and our 
auditor’s reports thereon), which we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, and the Annual Report, which is expected 
to be made available to us after that date. 
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing 
so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed on the other 
information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
When we read the Annual Report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate 
the matter to those Charged with Governance.

Independent Auditor's Report
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial 
Statements
The Bank’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these consolidated financial statements in term 
of the requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial performance 
and consolidated cash flows of the Group in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the 
Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act, the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and circulars, guidelines and 
directions issued by the Reserve Bank of India from time to time (the “RBI Guidelines”) as applicable to the Bank. The respective 
Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in 
accordance with the provisions of the Act and the RBI Guidelines for safeguarding the assets of the Group and for preventing and 
detecting frauds and other irregularities; the selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgements and 
estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, 
that were operating effectively for ensuring accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and 
presentation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the Board 
of Directors of the Bank, as aforesaid. 
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are 
responsible for assessing the ability of the respective entity to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate 
the respective entity or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 
The respective Board of Directors of the entities included in the Group are responsible for overseeing the respective entity’s financial 
reporting process. 
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing 
(“SAs”) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken 
on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. 
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout 
the audit. We also:
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for 
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control. 
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Bank 
has internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of 
such controls.
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by Management.
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit 
evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
ability of the Group to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw 
attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are

inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, 
and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves 
fair presentation.
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the 
Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the audit of the financial statements of such entities included in the consolidated financial statements of which 
we are the independent auditors. For the other entities included in the consolidated financial statements, which have been 
audited by other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits 
carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. 
We communicate with Those Charged with Governance of the Bank and such other entities included in the consolidated financial 
statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit 
and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. 
We also provide Those Charged with Governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to 
bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. 
From the matters communicated with Those Charged with Governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance 
in the audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2022 and are therefore the key audit 
matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter 
or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the 
adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
Other Matter 
We did not audit the financial statements of two subsidiaries, whose financial statements reflect total assets of ` 7,226,709 
Lacs as at March 31, 2022, total revenues of ` 1,346,577 Lacs and net cash flows amounting to ` 45,344 Lacs for the year 
ended on that date, as considered in the consolidated financial statements. These financial statements have been audited by 
other auditors whose reports have been furnished to us by the Management and our opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements, in so far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures included in respect of these subsidiaries, and our report in 
terms of sub-section (3) of Section 143 of the Act, in so far as it relates to the aforesaid subsidiaries, is based solely on the

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, and our report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements below, is 
not modified in respect of the above matters with respect to our reliance on the work done and the reports of the other auditors

Chartered Accountants, the statutory auditor of the Bank, who had expressed an unmodified opinion on those financial 
statements. Accordingly, we, M M Nissim & Co LLP, Chartered Accountants, do not express any opinion on the figures reported 
in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended / as at March 31, 2021.
 
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statement is not modified in respect of the above matter.

Independent Auditor's Report
ANNEXURE A TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT OF EVEN DATE ON THE CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF HDFC BANK LIMITED
[Referred to in paragraph 1(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ in the Independent Auditor’s Report 
of even date to the Members of HDFC Bank limited on the consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2022] 
Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies 
Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the Bank as of and for the year ended March 31, 2022, we 
have audited the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements of HDFC Bank Limited (hereinafter 
referred to as “the Bank”) and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, as of that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The respective Board of Directors of the Bank, its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, are responsible 
for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control with reference to consolidated financial 
statements criteria established by the respective companies considering the essential components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of India (“the ICAI”). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, 
including adherence to the respective Bank’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and 
errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as 
required under the Act.
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements of 
the Bank, its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, based on our audit. We conducted our audit in 
accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued 
by the ICAI and the Standards on Auditing prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of 
internal financial controls. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal 
control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgement, including the assessment of the 
risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports 
referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal 
financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements of the Bank, its subsidiary companies, which are companies 
incorporated in India.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With Reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
A Bank's internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external 
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Bank's internal financial control with reference to 
consolidated financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in 
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Bank; (2) provide reasonable 
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance

with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Bank are being made only in accordance 
with authorizations of management and directors of the Bank; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely 
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Bank's assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated 
financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls With Reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements, including the 
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not 
be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements to 
future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Bank, its subsidiary companies, 
which are companies incorporated in India, have, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated financial statements and such internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements were 
operating effectively as at March 31, 2022, based on the internal control with reference to consolidated financial statements criteria 
established by the respective companies considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note 
issued by the ICAI.
Other Matters
Our aforesaid reports under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements insofar as it relates to two subsidiary companies, which are companies 
incorporated in India, is based on the corresponding reports of the auditors of such companies incorporated in India.

subsidiaries in accordance with Accounting Standard (‘AS’) 
21, Consolidated Financial Statements, specified under 
Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, on a line-by-line 
basis by adding together the like items of assets, liabilities,

estimates and necessary assumptions in the reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities (including contingent 
liabilities) as of the date of the financial statements and 
the reported income and expenses for the reporting 
year. Management believes that the estimates used in 
the preparation of the financial statements are prudent 
and reasonable. Actual results could differ from these 
estimates. Any revision in the accounting estimates is 
recognised prospectively in the current and future periods.

(‘HFT’), “Available for Sale” (‘AFS’) and “Held to Maturity” 
(‘HTM’) categories (hereinafter called “categories”). 
Subsequent shifting amongst the categories is done 
in accordance with the RBI guidelines. Under each of 
these categories, investments are further classified under 
six groups (hereinafter called “groups”) - Government 
Securities, Other Approved Securities, Shares, Debentures 
and Bonds, Investments in Subsidiaries / Joint Ventures 
and Other Investments.

on settlement date except in the case of equity shares 
which are accounted on trade date.
 
Basis of classification:

the date of purchase are classified under HFT category. 
Investments which the Bank intends to hold till maturity are 
classified under HTM category. Investments in the equity 
of subsidiaries / joint ventures are categorised as HTM. 
Investments which are not classified in either of the above 
categories are classified under AFS category.

on debt instruments are recognised in the Profit and Loss 
Account and are not included in the cost of acquisition.
 
Disposal of investments:
 
Profit / Loss on sale of investments under the aforesaid 
three categories is recognised in the Profit and Loss 
Account. Cost of investments is based on the weighted 
average cost method. The profit from sale of investment 
under HTM category, net of taxes and transfer to statutory 
reserve is appropriated from the Profit and Loss Account 
to “Capital Reserve”.
 
Short sale:
 
The Bank undertakes short sale transactions in Central 
Government dated securities. The short position is 
categorised under HFT category and netted off from 
investments. The short position is marked to market and 
loss, if any, is charged to the Profit and Loss Account 
while gain, if any, is ignored. Profit / Loss on short sale is 
recognised on settlement date. 
 
Valuation:
 
Investments classified under AFS and HFT categories 
are marked to market individually and depreciation 
/ appreciation is aggregated for each group and net 
depreciation in each group is provided and net appreciation 
is ignored.
 
Traded investments are valued based on the trades / 
quotes on the recognised stock exchanges or prices 
published by Financial Benchmarks India Pvt Ltd. 
(FBIL) with Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives 
Association (FIMMDA) as the calculating agent. Investments 
denominated in foreign currencies are valued based on the 
prices provided by market information providers such as 
Bloomberg, Refinitiv, etc.

state government securities and special bonds such as oil 
bonds, fertilizer bonds etc. issued by the government of 
India, is computed as per the prices published by FBIL with 
FIMMDA as the calculating agent.

other approved securities and bonds and debentures), and 
preference shares, is done with appropriate mark-up, i.e. 
applicable FIMMDA published credit spread over the Yield 
to Maturity (YTM) rates for government of India securities as 
published by FBIL with FIMMDA as the calculating agent.
 
Unquoted equity shares are valued at the break-up 
value, if the latest Balance Sheet is available or at ` 1 for 
each company. 
 
Units of mutual funds are valued at the latest net asset value 
declared by the respective schemes of the mutual fund. 
 
Treasury bills, commercial papers and certificate of deposits 
being discounted instruments, are valued at carrying cost. 
 
Investments in Security receipts (SR) and unquoted 
units of Infrastructure Investment Trust (InvIT) are valued 
as per the net asset value provided by the issuing Asset 
Reconstruction Company and InvIT trust respectively. 
 
Investments in unquoted Venture Capital Fund (VCF) are 
categorised, at the discretion of the Bank, under HTM 
category for an initial period of three years and valued at 
cost during this period. Such investments are transferred 
to the AFS category after the said period of three years.

applicable for the NBFC category, based on the credit rating 
of the respective PTC over the YTM rates for government 
of India securities published by FBIL with FIMMDA as the 
calculating agent. 
 
Net depreciation, if any, compared to the acquisition cost, 
in any of the six groups, is charged to the Profit and Loss 
Account. The net appreciation, if any, in any of the six groups 
is not recognised except to the extent of depreciation 
provided earlier. The book value of individual securities is 
not changed on such revaluation of investments.
 
Investments classified under HTM category are carried 
at their acquisition cost and not marked to market. Any 
premium on acquisition is amortised over the remaining 
maturity period of the security on a constant yield to 
maturity basis. Such amortisation of premium is adjusted 
against interest income from investments. Any diminution, 
other than temporary, in the value of investments in HTM 
category is provided for.

Repo) transactions are reflected as borrowing and lending 
transactions respectively.

to be held for not more than one year from the date, on 
which such investments are made, are classified as current 
investments. All other investments are classified as long

or fair value, whichever is lower. Long-term investments are

to recognise a decline, other than temporary, in the value 
of the investments, such reduction being determined and 
made for each investment individually.
 
HDB Financial Services Limited
 
Investments expected to mature after twelve months are 
taken as long term / non-current investment and stated 
at cost. Provision is recognised only in case of diminution, 
which is other than temporary in nature. Investments

convertible into cash. All other investments are recognised 
as short term / current investments and are valued at lower 
of cost and net realisable value.

provisions for funded interest term loan and provision for

including credit exposures computed as per the current 
marked to market values of interest rate and foreign 
exchange derivative contracts and gold. In the case of 
overseas branches, general provision on standard assets 
is maintained at the higher of the levels stipulated by the 
respective overseas regulator or RBI. Provision for standard 
assets is included under other liabilities.
 
In addition to the above, the Bank on a prudent basis 
makes provisions on advances or exposures which are not

environment or specific information or basis regulatory 
guidance / instructions, of a possible slippage of a specific 
advance or a group of advances or exposures or potential 
exposures. These are classified as contingent provisions 
and included under other liabilities.
 
Provisions made in addition to the Bank’s policy for specific 
loan loss provisions for non-performing assets, possible 
slippage of specific exposures and regulatory general 
provisions are categorised as floating provisions. Creation 
of floating provisions is considered by the Bank up to a level 
approved by the Board of Directors. Floating provisions 
are used only for contingencies under extraordinary 
circumstances and for making specific provisions for nonperforming accounts. Floating provisions are included 
under other liabilities.
 
Further to the provisions required to be held according 
to the asset classification status, provisions are held for 
individual country exposures (other than for home country 
exposure). Countries are categorised into risk categories

that country where the net funded exposure is one percent 
or more of the Bank’s total assets. Provision for country risk 
is included under other liabilities.

framework for resolution of stressed assets and the

standard, sub-standard and doubtful assets as per the 
Company policy approved by the Board and as per RBI 
guidelines. The rates applied for making provisions on nonperforming assets (NPA) are higher than those required by 
the relevant RBI guidelines. Interest on non-performing 
assets is transferred to an interest suspense account and 
not recognised in the Profit and Loss Account until received. 
Receivables under financing activity are recognised on 
disbursement of loan and in case of new asset financing 
on the transfer of ownership.
 
Provisioning:
 
The Company assesses all receivables for their recoverability 
and accordingly recognises provision for non-performing 
and doubtful assets as per approved Company policies 
and guidelines. The Company ensures provisions made 
are not lower than as stipulated by RBI guidelines.

the time of acquisition of loans are charged to expenses.

Securitisation and transfer of assets
 
HDFC Bank Limited
 
Assets transferred through securitisation and direct 
assignment of cash flows are de-recognised in the Balance 
Sheet when they are sold (true sale criteria being fully met 
with) and consideration is received. Sales / transfers that do 
not meet true sale criteria are accounted for as borrowings. 
For a securitisation or direct assignment transaction, the 
Bank recognises profit upon receipt of the funds and loss 
is recognised at the time of sale.
 
On sale of stressed assets, if the sale is at a price below 
the net book value (i.e., funded outstanding less specific 
provisions held), the shortfall is charged to the Profit and 
Loss Account and if the sale is for a value higher than the 
net book value, the excess provision is credited to the 
Profit and Loss Account in the year when the sum of cash 
received by way of initial consideration and / or redemption 
or transfer of security receipts issued by SC / RC exceeds 
the net book value of the loan at the time of transfer.
 
In respect of stressed assets sold under an asset 
securitisation, where the investment by the bank in security 
receipts (SRs) backed by the assets sold by it is more than 
10 percent of such SRs, provisions held are higher of the 
provisions required in terms of net asset value declared 
by the Securitisation Company (‘SC’) / Reconstruction 
Company (‘RC’) and provisions as per the extant norms 
applicable to the underlying loans, notionally treating the 
book value of these SRs as the corresponding stressed 
loans assuming the loans remained in the books of 
the Bank. 
 
The Bank invests in Pass Through Certificates (PTCs) 
issued by other Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs). These 
are accounted at acquisition cost and are classified as 
investments. The Bank also buys loans through the direct 
assignment route which are classified as advances. These 
are carried at acquisition cost unless it is more than the 
face value, in which case the premium is amortised based 
on effective interest rate method.
 
The Bank transfers advances through inter-bank 
participation with and without risk. In the case of participation

with risk, the aggregate amount of the participation issued 
by the Bank is reduced from advances. In case where 
the Bank is assuming risk by participation, the aggregate 
amount of the participation is classified under advances. 
In the case of issue of participation certificate without 
risk, the aggregate amount of participation issued by the 
Bank is classified under borrowings and where the Bank 
is acquiring participation certificate, the aggregate amount 
of participation acquired is shown as due from banks 
under advances.
 
HDB Financial Services Limited

Fixed assets and depreciation
 
HDFC Bank Limited
 
Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation as adjusted for impairment, if any. Cost 
includes cost of purchase and all expenditure like site 
preparation, installation costs and professional fees 
incurred on the asset before it is ready to use. Subsequent 
expenditure incurred on assets put to use is capitalised only 
when it increases the future benefit / functioning capability 
from / of such assets. 
 
Depreciation is charged over the estimated useful life of 
the fixed asset on a straight-line basis. The management 
believes that the useful life of assets assessed by the 
Bank, pursuant to Part C of Schedule II to the Companies 
Act, 2013, taking into account changes in environment, 
changes in technology, the utility and efficacy of the asset 
in use, fairly reflects its estimate of useful lives of the fixed 
assets. The estimated useful lives of key fixed assets are

life of an asset, the unamortised depreciable amount 
is charged over the revised remaining useful life of the 
said asset.

transfer to statutory reserve, are transferred to capital 
reserve account.

beyond its previously assessed standard of performance.
 
Items of fixed assets that have been retired from active 
use and are held for disposal are stated at the lower of 
their net book value and net realisable value and are shown

fixed assets are measured as the difference between the 
net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset and are recognised net, within “Other Income” or 
“Other Expenses”, as the case maybe, in the Profit and 
Loss Account in the year of disposal or retirement.
 
Capital work-in-progress are fixed assets which are not yet 
ready for their intended use. Such assets are carried at cost 
comprising direct cost and related incidental expenses.

depreciate the assets using the straight-line method over 
the estimated useful lives of the assets.

attributable expenditure on making the asset ready 
for its intended use and net of any trade discounts 
and rebates. Subsequent expenditure on an intangible 
asset is charged to the Profit and Loss Account as an 
expense unless it is probable that such expenditure will 
enable the intangible asset increase the future benefits 
from the existing asset beyond its previously assessed 
standard of performance and such expenditure can 
be measured and attributed to the intangible asset 
reliably, in which case, such expenditure is capitalised.
Expenditure on software development eligible for 
capitalisation are carried as intangible assets under 
development where such assets are not yet ready for 
their intended use.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis 
over their estimated useful lives. The amortisation 
period and the amortisation method are reviewed 
at least at each reporting date. If the expected 
useful life of the asset is significantly different from 
previous estimates, the amortisation period is 
changed accordingly.
Gains or losses arising from the retirement or disposal 
of an intangible asset are determined as the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and recognised as income or 
expense in the Profit and Loss Account in the year 
of disposal.
 
The estimated useful lives of intangible assets used for 
amortisation are:

Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment, if any. The cost of fixed 
assets comprise purchase price and any attributable cost 
of bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended 
use. Subsequent expenditure incurred on assets put to 
use is capitalised only when it increases the future benefit 
/ functioning capability from / of such assets.

Items costing less than ` 5,000 are fully depreciated 
in the year of purchase.
The Company has estimated Nil residual value at the 
end of the useful life for all block of assets.
For assets purchased and sold during the year, 
depreciation is being provided on pro-rata basis by 
the Company.
 
Software and system development expenditure are

Impairment of assets
 
The Group assesses at each Balance Sheet date whether 
there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. 
Impairment loss, if any, is provided to the extent the 
carrying amount of assets exceeds their estimated 
recoverable amount.

Translation of foreign currency items
 
HDFC Bank Limited
 
Foreign currency income and expenditure items of domestic 
operations are translated at the exchange rates prevailing 
on the date of the transaction. Income and expenditure 
items of integral foreign operations (representative offices) 
are translated at the weekly average closing rates and 
of non-integral foreign operations (foreign branches and 
offshore banking units) at the monthly average closing rates.
 
Foreign currency monetary items of domestic and integral 
foreign operations are translated at the closing exchange 
rates notified by Foreign Exchange Dealers’ Association 
of India (FEDAI) as at the Balance Sheet date and the 
resulting net revaluation profit or loss arising due to a net 
open position in any foreign currency is recognised in the 
Profit and Loss Account.
 
Both monetary and non-monetary foreign currency 
assets and liabilities of non-integral foreign operations 
are translated at closing exchange rates notified by FEDAI 
at the Balance Sheet date and the resulting profit / loss 
arising from exchange differences are accumulated in the 
Foreign Currency Translation Account until disposal of the 
non-integral foreign operations in accordance with AS - 11, 
The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates and the 
extant RBI guidelines.
 
Foreign currency denominated contingent liabilities on 
account of foreign exchange and derivative contracts, 
guarantees, letters of credit, acceptances and 
endorsements are reported at closing rates of exchange 
notified by FEDAI as at the Balance Sheet date.
 
HDFC Securities Limited
 
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the rates 
of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction. 
Exchange differences, if any arising out of transactions 
settled during the year are recognised in the Profit and 
Loss Account. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies as at the Balance Sheet date are 
translated at the closing exchange rate on that date. The 
exchange differences, if any, are recognised in the Profit 
and Loss Account and related assets and liabilities are 
accordingly restated in the Balance Sheet.

Foreign exchange and derivative contracts
 
HDFC Bank Limited
 
Foreign exchange spot and forward contracts, both 
deliverable and non-deliverable, outstanding as at the 
Balance Sheet date and held for trading, are revalued 
at the closing spot and forward rates respectively as 
notified by FEDAI and at interpolated rates for contracts of 
interim maturities. 
 
The USD-INR exchange rate for valuation of contracts 
having longer maturities i.e. greater than one year, is derived 
using the USD-INR spot rate as well as relevant INR yield 
curve and USD yield curve. For other currency pairs, the 
forward points (for rates / tenors not published by FEDAI) 
are obtained from Refinitiv or Bloomberg for valuation of the 

Schedules to the Consolidated Financial Statements
As at March 31, 2022
forex deals. Valuation is considered on present value basis. 
For this purpose, the forward profit or loss on the deals 
are discounted till the valuation date using the discounting 
yields. The resulting profit or loss on valuation is recognised 
in the Profit and Loss Account. Foreign exchange contracts 
are classified as assets when the fair value is positive 
(positive marked to market value) or as liabilities when the 
fair value is negative (negative marked to market value).
 
Foreign exchange forward contracts not intended for 
trading, that are entered into to establish the amount of 
reporting currency required or available at the settlement 
date of a transaction and are outstanding at the Balance 
Sheet date, are effectively valued at the closing spot rate. 
The premium or discount arising at the inception of such 
forward exchange contract is amortised as expense or 
income over the life of the contract.
 
The Bank recognises all derivative contracts at fair value, on 
the date on which the derivative contracts are entered into 
and are re-measured at fair value as at the Balance Sheet 
date. Derivatives are classified as assets when the fair value 
is positive (positive marked to market value) or as liabilities 
when the fair value is negative (negative marked to market 
value). 
 
The Bank as part of its risk management strategy, makes 
use of financial derivative instruments, including foreign 
exchange forward contracts, for hedging the risk embedded 
in some of its financial assets or liabilities recognised on the 
balance sheet. The Bank identifies the hedged item (asset 
or liability) at the inception of the transaction itself. Hedge 
effectiveness is ascertained at the time of the inception of 
the hedge and at the reporting date thereafter.
 
In case of a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of 
the hedging instruments and hedged items are recognised 
in the Profit and Loss Account and in case of cash flow 
hedges, the changes in fair value of effective portion are 
recognised in Reserves and Surplus under ‘Cash flow 
hedge reserve’ and ineffective portion of an effective 
hedging relationship, if any, is recognised in the Profit 
and Loss Account. The accumulated balance in the cash 
flow hedge reserve, in an effective hedging relationship, is 
recycled in the Profit and Loss Account at the same time 
that the impact from the hedged item is recognised in the 
Profit and Loss Account.
 
HDB Financial Services Limited
 
Derivative contracts are designated as cash flow hedges, 
the hedging instrument is measured at fair value and any 
gain or loss that is determined to be an effective hedge is 
recognised within equity i.e., Cash flow Hedge Reserve. 
Amounts recognised in equity are transferred to the Profit 
and Loss Account in the same period as the cash flows of 
hedged items affect the Profit and Loss Account. When a 
derivative contract expires or is sold or if a hedge no longer 
meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative 
profit or loss in the Cash Flow Hedge Reserve is retained 
in equity until the hedged cash flow is recognised in the 
Profit and Loss Account. However, if hedged cash flows 
are no longer expected to occur, the profit or loss against 
the corresponding derivative contract, accumulated in the 
Cash Flow Hedge Reserve, is immediately released through 
the Profit and Loss Account. Changes in the fair values 
of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge 
accounting are recognised immediately in the Profit and 
Loss Account.

HDFC Bank Limited 
Interest income is recognised in the Profit and Loss 
Account on an accrual basis, except in the case of nonperforming assets and overdue interest on retail EMI 
based performing advances, which are recognised

Employee benefits
 
HDFC Bank Limited
 
Employee Stock Option Scheme (ESOS):
 
The Employee Stock Option Scheme (‘the Scheme’) 
provides for the grant of options to acquire equity shares 
of the Bank to its employees and whole time directors. 
The options granted to employees vest as per their vesting 
schedule and these may be exercised by the employees 
within a specified period. 
 
The Bank follows the intrinsic value method to account for 
its stock-based employee compensation plans in respect of 
options granted up to March 31, 2021. Compensation cost 
is measured by the excess, if any, of the market price of 
the underlying stock over the exercise price as determined 
under the option plan. The market price is the closing 
price on the stock exchange where there is highest trading 
volume on the working day immediately preceding the date 
of grant. Compensation cost, if any is amortised over the 
vesting period.
 
Effective April 01, 2021, the fair value of share-linked 
instruments on the date of grant for all instruments granted 
after March 31, 2021 is recognised as an expense in 
accordance with the RBI guidelines on Compensation of 
Whole Time Directors / Chief Executive Officers / Material 
Risk Takers and Control Function staff. The fair value of the 
stock-based employee compensation is estimated using 
Black-Scholes model. The compensation cost is amortised 
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the option 
with a corresponding credit to Employee Stock Options 
Reserve. On exercise of the stock options, corresponding 
balance in Employee Stock Options Reserve is transferred 
to Share Premium. In respect of the options which expire 
unexercised, the balance standing to the credit of Employee 
Stock Options Reserve is transferred to General Reserve.
 
Gratuity:
 
The Bank has an obligation towards gratuity, a defined 
benefit retirement plan covering all eligible employees. 
The plan benefit vests upon completion of five years of 
service and is in the form of lump sum amount, without an 
upper limit, equivalent to 15 days’ basic salary payable for 
each completed year of service to all eligible employees on 
resignation, retirement, death while in employment or on 
termination of employment. The Bank makes contributions 
to a recognised Gratuity Trust administered by trustees and 
whose funds are managed by insurance companies. In 
respect of erstwhile Lord Krishna Bank (eLKB) employees, 
the Bank makes contribution to a fund set up by eLKB and 
administered by the Board of Trustees. 
 
The defined gratuity benefit plans are valued by an 
independent actuary as at the Balance Sheet date using 
the projected unit credit method as per the requirement of 
AS-15, Employee Benefits, to determine the present value 
of the defined benefit obligation and the related service 
costs. The actuarial calculations entails assumptions about 
demographics, early retirement, salary increases and 
interest rates. Actuarial gain or loss is recognised in the 
Profit and Loss Account.

Schedules to the Consolidated Financial Statements
As at March 31, 2022
 
Superannuation:
 
The Bank has a Superannuation Plan under which 
employees of the Bank, above a prescribed grade, are 
entitled to receive retirement benefits either through salary 
or under a defined contribution plan. For those opting for 
a defined contribution plan, the Bank contributes a sum 
equivalent to 13% of the employee’s eligible annual basic 
salary (15% for the whole time directors and for certain 
eligible employees of the erstwhile Centurion Bank of 
Punjab (eCBoP staff) to a Trust administered by trustees 
and whose funds are managed by insurance companies. 
The Bank has no liability towards future superannuation 
fund benefits other than its contribution, and recognises 
such contribution as an expense in the year incurred.
 
Provident fund:
 
The Bank is covered under the Employees Provident Fund 
and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 and accordingly 
all employees of the Bank are entitled to receive benefits 
under the provident fund. The Bank contributes an amount, 
on a monthly basis, at a determined rate (currently 12% 
of employee’s basic salary). Of this, the Bank contributes 
an amount equal to 8.33% of employee’s basic salary up 
to a maximum salary level of ` 15,000/- per month, to the 
Pension Scheme administered by the Regional Provident 
Fund Office. The balance amount of the 12% employer’s 
share is contributed to an exempted Trust set up by the 
Bank and administered by a Board of Trustees. The Bank 
recognises such contributions as an expense in the year in 
which it is incurred. Interest payable to the members of the 
exempted trust shall not be lower than the statutory rate 
of interest declared by the Central Government under the 
Employees Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions 
Act, 1952 and shortfall, if any, shall be made good by 
the Bank.
 
The guidance note on implementing AS-15, Employee 
Benefits, states that benefits involving employer established 
provident funds, which require interest shortfalls to be 
provided, are to be considered as defined benefit plans. 
Actuarial valuation of this Provident Fund interest shortfall 
is done as per the guidance note issued in this respect by 
The Institute of Actuaries of India (IAI) and provision towards 
this liability is made.
 
The overseas branches of the Bank make contribution to the 
respective applicable government social security scheme 
calculated as a percentage of the employees’ salaries. 
The Bank’s obligations are limited to these contributions, 
which are expensed when due, as such contribution is in 
the nature of defined contribution.
 
Pension:
 
In respect of pension payable to certain eLKB employees 
under the Lord Krishna Bank (Employees) Pension 
Scheme, which is a defined benefit scheme, the Bank 
contributes 10% of basic salary to a pension trust set up 
by the Bank and administered by the Board of Trustees and 
an additional amount towards the liability shortfall based on 
an independent actuarial valuation as at the Balance Sheet 
date, which includes assumptions about demographics, 
early retirement, salary increases and interest rates.
 
In respect of certain eLKB employees who had moved to 
a Cost to Company (CTC) based compensation structure 
and had completed less than 15 years of service, the 
contribution which was made until then, is maintained as a 
fund and will be converted into annuity on separation after a 
lock-in-period of two years. For this category of employees, 
liability stands frozen and no additional provision is required 
except for interest as applicable to Provident Fund, which 
is provided for.
 
In respect of certain eLKB employees who moved to a CTC 
structure and had completed service of more than 15 years, 
pension would be paid on separation based on salary 
applicable as on the date of movement to CTC structure. 
Provision thereto is made based on an independent 
actuarial valuation as at the Balance Sheet date.
 
National Pension Scheme (NPS):
 
In respect of employees who opt for contribution to the 
NPS, the Bank contributes certain percentage of the basic 
salary of employees to the aforesaid scheme, a defined 
contribution plan, which is managed and administered by 
pension fund management companies. The Bank has no 
liability other than its contribution, and recognises such 
contributions as an expense in the year incurred.
 
HDFC Securities Limited
 
Short term
 
Short term employee benefits include salaries and 
performance incentives. A liability is recognised for the 
amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus 
or target based incentives if the Company has a present 
legal or informal obligation to pay this amount as a result of 
past service provided by the employee, and the obligation 
can be estimated reliably. These costs are recognised as an 
expense in the Profit and Loss Account at the undiscounted 
amount expected to be paid over the period of services 
rendered by the employees to the Company.
 
Post-employment
 
The Company offers its employees long term benefits by 
way of defined-contribution and defined-benefit plans, of

which some have assets in special funds or securities. The 
plans are financed by the Company and in the case of 
some defined contribution plans by the Company along 
with its employees.
 Defined-contribution plans
 
These are plans in which the Company pays pre-defined 
amounts to separate funds and does not have any legal 
or informal obligation to pay additional sums. These 
comprise of contributions to the National Pension Scheme, 
Employees’ Provident Fund, Family Pension Fund and 
Superannuation Fund. The Company’s payments to the 
defined-contribution plans are reported as expenses during 
the period in which the employees perform the services 
that the payment covers.
 
Defined-benefit plans
 
Expenses for defined-benefit gratuity plan are calculated 
as at the Balance Sheet date by an independent actuary 
in a manner that distributes expenses over the employee’s 
working life. These commitments are valued at the present 
value of the expected future payments, with consideration 
for calculated future salary increases, using a discount rate 
corresponding to the interest rate estimated by the actuary 
having regard to the interest rate on government bonds with 
a remaining term that is almost equivalent to the average 
balance working period of employees. The fair values of 
the plan assets are deducted in determining the net liability. 
When the fair value of plan assets exceeds the commitments 
computed as aforesaid, the recognised asset is limited to 
the net total of any cumulative past service costs and the 
present value of any economic benefits available in the form 
of reductions in future contributions to the plan. 
 
Actuarial losses or gains are recognised in the Profit and 
Loss Account in the year in which they arise.
 
Other long term employee benefits
 
Compensated absences which accrue to employees and 
which can be carried to future periods and are expected 
to be availed in more than twelve months immediately 
following the year in which the employee has rendered 
service are reported as expenses during the year in which 
the employees perform the services that the benefit covers 
and the liabilities are reported at the undiscounted amount 
of the benefits. 
 
Share-based payment transactions
The cost of equity-settled instrument is determined by 
the fair value at the date when the grant is made using 
an appropriate valuation model.
That cost is recognised, together with a corresponding 
increase in share-based payment reserves in equity, 
over the period in which the performance and /
or service conditions are fulfilled. The cumulative 
expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at 
each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the 
extent to which the vesting period has expired and 
the Company’s best estimate of the number of equity 
instruments that will ultimately vest.
When the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, 
the minimum expense recognised is the expense 
had the terms had not been modified, if the original 
terms of the award are met. An additional expense is 
recognised for any modification that increases the total 
fair value of the share-based payment transaction, or 
is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at 
the date of modification. Where an award is cancelled 
by the entity or by the counter-party, any remaining 
element of the fair value of the award is expensed 
immediately through the Profit and Loss Account.
 
HDB Financial Services Limited 
 
Gratuity
 
The Company provides for gratuity to all employees. The 
benefit is in the form of lump sum payments to vested 
employees on resignation, retirement, or death while 
in employment or on termination of employment of an 
amount equivalent to 15 days basic salary payable for 
each completed year of service. Vesting occurs upon 
completion of five years of service. The Company makes 
annual contributions to fund administered by trustees and 
managed by insurance companies. The defined benefit 
plan are valued by an independent external actuary as 
at the Balance Sheet date using the projected unit credit 
method to determine the present value of defined benefit 
obligation and the related service costs. Under this method, 
the determination is based on actuarial calculations, which 
include assumptions about demographics, early retirement, 
salary increases and interest rates. Actuarial gain or loss is 
recognised in the Profit and Loss Account.
 
Provident fund
 
In accordance with the applicable law, all employees of 
the Company are entitled to receive benefits under the 
Provident Fund Act, 1952. The Company contributes an 
amount, on a monthly basis, at a determined rate to the 
Pension Scheme administered by the Regional Provident 
Fund Commissioner ('RPFC') and the Company has no 
liability for future provident fund benefits other than its 
annual contribution. Since it is a defined contribution plan, 
the contributions are accounted for on an accrual basis and 
recognised in the Profit and Loss Account.

Schedules to the Consolidated Financial Statements
As at March 31, 2022
 Employee Stock Option Plan
 
The Company has adopted fair value method for options 
granted post March 31, 2021. All the options granted if any 
prior to March 31, 2021 are valued at intrinsic value method. 
Compensation cost is measured by the excess, if any, of 
the fair value of the underlying stock over the exercise 
price as determined under the option plan. The fair value 
of options have been estimated on the dates of each grant 
using the Black-Scholes model. 
10 Debit and credit card reward points
 
HDFC Bank Limited
 
The Bank estimates the probable redemption of debit 
and credit card reward points and cost per point using an 
actuarial method by employing an independent actuary, 
which includes assumptions such as mortality, redemption 
and spends. Provisions for liabilities on the outstanding 
reward points are made based on an independent actuarial 
valuation as at the Balance Sheet date and included in 
other liabilities and provisions.
11 Bullion
 
HDFC Bank Limited
 
The Bank imports bullion including precious metal bars on 
a consignment basis. The imports are typically on a backto-back basis and are priced to the customer based on 
the price quoted by the supplier. The difference between 
the price recovered from customers and cost of bullion 
is accounted at the time of sale to the customers and 
reported as “Other Income’’.
 
The Bank also deals in bullion on a borrowing and lending 
basis and the interest thereon is accounted as interest 
expense / income respectively.
12 Lease accounting
 
Lease payments including cost escalation for assets taken 
on operating lease are recognised in the Profit and Loss 
Account over the lease term on a straight-line basis in 
accordance with the AS-19, Leases.
13 Income tax
 
Income tax expense comprises current tax provision (i.e. 
the amount of tax for the period determined in accordance 
with the Income Tax Act, 1961, the rules framed there 
under and considering the material principles set out in 
Income Computation and Disclosure Standards) and the 
net change in the deferred tax asset or liability during the 
year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for 
the future tax consequences of timing differences between 
the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their 
respective tax bases, and operating loss carried forward, 
if any. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using 
the enacted or substantively enacted tax rates as at the 
Balance Sheet date. 
 
Current tax assets and liabilities and deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are off-set when they relate to income taxes 
levied by the same taxation authority, when the entity has 
a legal right to off-set and when the entity intends to settle 
on a net basis.
 
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent there 
is reasonable certainty that the assets can be realised 
in future. In case of unabsorbed depreciation or carried 
forward loss under taxation laws, deferred tax assets are 
recognised only if there is virtual certainty of realisation 
of such assets. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each 
Balance Sheet date and appropriately adjusted to reflect the 
amount that is reasonably / virtually certain to be realised.
14 Earnings per share
 
The Group reports basic and diluted earnings per equity 
share in accordance with AS-20, Earnings per Share. Basic 
earnings per equity share has been computed by dividing 
net profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders by 
the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding 
for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential 
dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to 
issue equity shares were exercised or converted to equity 
during the year. Diluted earnings per equity share are 
computed using the weighted average number of equity 
shares and the dilutive potential equity shares outstanding 
during the period except where the results are anti-dilutive.
15 Share issue expenses
 
HDFC Bank Limited
 
Share issue expenses are adjusted against Share Premium 
Account in terms of Section 52 of the Companies Act, 2013.
16 Segment information 
 
The disclosure relating to segment information is in 
accordance with AS-17, Segment Reporting and as per 
guidelines issued by RBI.
17 Accounting for provisions, contingent liabilities 
and contingent assets
 
In accordance with AS-29, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities 
and Contingent Assets, the Group recognises provisions 
when it has a present obligation as a result of a past event, 
it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation 
and when a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation 
can be made.

Provisions are determined based on management estimate 
required to settle the obligation at the Balance Sheet date, 
supplemented by experience of similar transactions. These 
are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and adjusted to 
reflect the current management estimates. 
 
A disclosure of contingent liability is made when there is:
a possible obligation arising from a past event, the 
existence of which will be confirmed by the occurrence 
or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future 
events not within the control of the Group; or
a present obligation arising from a past event which is 
not recognised as it is not probable that an outflow of 
resources will be required to settle the obligation or a 
reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation cannot 
be made.
 
When there is a possible obligation or a present obligation 
in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is

Dividend
 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), vide its notification dated April 22, 2021 mentioned that banks may pay dividend on equity 
shares from the profits for the financial year ended March 31, 2021, subject to the quantum of dividend being not more than

dividend of ` 6.50 per equity share of ` 1/- each aggregating to ` 3,592.40 crore, for the financial year ended March 31, 2021.

Proposed scheme of amalgamation
 
The Board of Directors at its meeting held on April 04, 2022, approved a composite Scheme of amalgamation ("Scheme"), 
for the amalgamation of: (i) HDFC Investments Limited and HDFC Holdings Limited, into and with Housing Development 
Finance Corporation Limited ("HDFC Limited"); and thereafter (ii) HDFC Limited into HDFC Bank Limited, and their respective 
shareholders and creditors, under Sections 230 to 232 of the Companies Act, 2013 and other applicable laws including the 
rules and regulations. The share exchange ratio shall be 42 equity shares of face value of ` 1/- each of the Bank for every 25 
equity shares of face value of ` 2/- each of HDFC Limited. The Scheme is subject to the receipt of requisite approvals from 
statutory and regulatory authorities, and the respective shareholders and creditors, under applicable law.
 
As per the scheme, the appointed date for the amalgamation of HDFC Limited with and into the Bank shall be the effective 
date of the scheme. Upon the scheme becoming effective, the Bank will issue equity shares to the shareholders of HDFC 
Limited as on the record date. The equity shares held by HDFC Limited in the Bank will be extinguished as per the scheme.

Change in accounting policy
 
The RBI, vide its clarification dated August 30, 2021 on Guidelines on Compensation of Whole Time Directors / Chief Executive 
Officers / Material Risk Takers and Control Function Staff, advised Banks that the fair value of share-linked instruments on the 
date of grant should be recognised as an expense for all instruments granted after the accounting period ending March 31, 
2021. Accordingly, the Group has changed its accounting policy from the intrinsic value method to the fair value method for 
all employee stock options granted after March 31, 2021. The fair value is estimated on the date of grant using Black-Scholes 
model and is recognised as compensation expense over the vesting period. As a result, ‘Employees cost’ for the year ended 
March 31, 2022 is higher by ` 341.24 crore with a consequent reduction in profit after tax by the said amount.

Capital infusion
 
During the year ended March 31, 2022, the Bank has allotted 3,27,64,494 equity shares (previous year: 2,94,90,022 equity 
shares) aggregating to face value of ` 3.27 crore (previous year: ` 2.95 crore) on exercise of stock options. Accordingly, the 
share capital increased by ` 3.27 crore (previous year: ` 2.95 crore) and the share premium increased by ` 2,606.48 crore 
(previous year: ` 1,757.15 crore).

to the Group of ` 38,052.75 crore (previous year: ` 31,833.21 crore) and the weighted average number of equity shares 
outstanding during the year of 5,53,32,03,566 (previous year: 5,49,96,68,151).

computed by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to the equity shareholders by the weighted average number of 
equity shares and dilutive potential equity shares outstanding during the year, except where the results are anti-dilutive. The 
dilutive impact is on account of stock options granted to employees by the Bank. There is no impact of dilution on the profits 
in the current year and previous year.

HDFC Bank Limited
 
The shareholders of the Bank approved the grant of equity share options under Plan “C” in June 2005, Plan “D” in June 2007, 
Plan “E” in June 2010, Plan “F” in June 2013 and Plan “G” in July 2016. Under the terms of each of these Plans, the Bank may 
issue to its employees and Whole Time Directors, Equity Stock Options (‘ESOPs’) each of which is convertible into one equity 
share. All the plans were framed in accordance with the SEBI (Employee Stock Option Scheme & Employee Stock Purchase 
Scheme) Guidelines, 1999 as amended from time to time and as applicable at the time of the grant. The accounting for the 
stock options has been in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Share Based Employee Benefits and

Plans C, D, E, F and G provide for the issuance of options at the recommendation of the Nomination and Remuneration 
Committee of the Board (‘NRC’) at the closing price on the working day immediately preceding the date when options are 
granted. This closing price is the closing price of the Bank’s equity share on an Indian stock exchange with the highest trading 
volume as of the working day preceding the date of grant. 
 
The vesting conditions applicable to the options are at the discretion of the NRC. These options are exercisable on vesting, 
for a period as set forth by the NRC at the time of the grant. The period in which the options may be exercised cannot exceed 
five years from date of expiry of vesting period. During the financial year 2021-22, certain modifications were made in the 
subsisting ESOP Plans pursuant to the approval of the shareholders of the Bank as to allow any employee of the Bank moving 
/ getting transferred to a subsidiary company, to be so entitled to the stock options already granted to such an employee as 
continuity of service for Long Term Incentives earned during the course of his / her service with the Bank.

Contingent liability*
Brief description

Claims against the Group not 
acknowledged as debts - taxation
The Group is a party to various taxation matters in respect of which appeals are pending. 
The Group expects the outcome of the appeals to be favorable based on decisions on 
similar issues in the previous years by the appellate authorities, based on the facts of 
the case and taxation laws.

Claims against the Group not 
acknowledged as debts - others
The Group is a party to various legal proceedings in the normal course of business. 
The Group does not expect the outcome of these proceedings to have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s financial conditions, results of operations or cash flows.

Partly paid investments
This represents amount remaining unpaid towards liability for partly paid investments.

Liability on account of forward 
exchange and derivative contracts
The Group enters into foreign exchange contracts, currency options, forward rate 
agreements, currency swaps and interest rate swaps with inter-bank participants on 
its own account and for customers. Forward exchange contracts are commitments 
to buy or sell foreign currency at a future date at the contracted rate. Currency swaps 
are commitments to exchange cash flows by way of interest / principal in one currency 
against another, based on predetermined rates. Interest rate swaps are commitments 
to exchange fixed and floating interest rate cash flows. The notional amounts of financial 
instruments such as foreign exchange contracts and derivatives provide a basis for 
comparison with instruments recognised on the Balance Sheet but do not necessarily 
indicate the amounts of future cash flows involved or the current fair value of the 
instruments and, therefore, do not indicate the Bank’s exposure to credit or price risks. 
The derivative instruments become favorable (assets) or unfavorable (liabilities) as a 
result of fluctuations in market rates or prices relative to their terms.

Guarantees given on behalf 
of constituents, acceptances, 
endorsements and other obligations
As a part of its commercial banking activities, the Bank issues documentary credit and 
guarantees on behalf of its customers. Documentary credits such as letters of credit 
enhance the credit standing of the Bank’s customers. Guarantees generally represent 
irrevocable assurances that the Bank will make payments in the event of the customer 
failing to fulfill its financial or performance obligations.

Other items for which the Group is 
contingently liable
These include: a) Credit enhancements in respect of securitised-out loans; b) Bills 
rediscounted by the Bank; c) Capital commitments; d) Underwriting commitments; e) 
Investment purchases pending settlement; f) Amount transferred to the RBI under the 
Depositor Education and Awareness Fund (DEAF).

HDFC Bank Limited
During the years ended March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021, no non-performing financial assets were 
acquired by the Bank.
Pursuant to the RBI Master Direction on Transfer of Loan Exposures dated September 24, 2021, the

 From the above, 58 loans aggregating to ` 11.45 crore was re-purchased by the transferor in compliance with 
paragraph 48 of Master Direction - RBI (Transfer of Loan Exposures) Directions, 2021.
The Bank has not acquired any Special Mention Account.
The RBI Master Direction on Transfer of Loan Exposures dated September 24, 2021 has mandated disclosure of 
transfer of loan assets. Considering the terms ‘loans not in default’ and ‘special mention account’ under this circular 
vis-a-vis loans termed as ‘standard’ as hitherto and the separate processes prescribed therein for transfer of such 
assets, the Bank believes that such disclosure would be more meaningful if disclosed prospectively and therefore 
transfer of loan exposures prior to September 24, 2021 including comparatives of previous year are not considered 
relevant for disclosure.

The company has not acquired any stressed loan and loan not in default during the period from September 24, 2021 to March

Amortisation of expenditure on account of enhancement in family pension of employees of banks
The Reserve Bank of India, vide its notification dated October 04, 2021 granted Banks an option to amortise the expenditure 
on account of enhancement of family pension, over a period not exceeding five years beginning with the financial year ending 
March 31, 2022, subject to a minimum of one-fifth of the total amount involved being expensed every year. The Bank has not 
availed the said option and has recognised the entire expenditure on account of enhancement of family pension in financial 
year ended March 31, 2022.
 
Provident fund
The guidance note on AS-15, Employee Benefits, states that employer established provident funds, where interest is guaranteed 
are to be considered as defined benefit plans and the liability has to be valued. The Institute of Actuaries of India (IAI) has issued 
a guidance note on valuation of interest rate guarantees on exempt provident funds. The actuary has accordingly valued the 
same and the Bank held a provision of Nil as at March 31, 2022 (previous year: Nil), towards the present value of the guaranteed 
interest benefit obligation. The actuary has followed the deterministic approach as prescribed by the guidance note.

18 Segment reporting
 
Business segments 
Business segments have been identified and reported taking into account, the target customer profile, the nature of products 
and services, the differing risks and returns, the organisation structure, the internal business reporting system and the guidelines 
prescribed by RBI. The Group operates in the following segments:
(a) Treasury 
 
The treasury segment primarily consists of net interest earnings from the Bank’s investment portfolio, money market 
borrowing and lending, gains or losses on investment operations and on account of trading in foreign exchange and 
derivative contracts.
(b) Retail banking
 
The retail banking segment serves retail customers through the Bank’s branch network and other channels. This segment 
raises deposits from customers and provides loans and other services to customers with the help of specialist product 
groups. Exposures are classified under retail banking taking into account the status of the borrower (orientation criterion), 
the nature of product, granularity of the exposure and the quantum thereof.
 
Revenues of the retail banking segment are derived from interest earned on retail loans, interest earned from other 
segments for surplus funds placed with those segments, subvention received from dealers and manufacturers, fees from 
services rendered, foreign exchange earnings on retail products, etc. Expenses of this segment primarily comprise interest 
expense on deposits, commission paid to retail assets sales agents, infrastructure and premises expenses for operating 
the branch network and other delivery channels, personnel costs, other direct overheads and allocated expenses of 
specialist product groups, processing units and support groups.
(c) Wholesale banking
 
The wholesale banking segment provides loans, non-fund facilities and transaction services to large corporates, emerging 
corporates, public sector units, government bodies, financial institutions and medium scale enterprises. Revenues of the 
wholesale banking segment consist of interest earned on loans made to customers, interest / fees earned on the cash 
float arising from transaction services, earnings from trade services and other non-fund facilities and also earnings from 
foreign exchange and derivative transactions on behalf of customers. The principal expenses of the segment consist of 
interest expense on funds borrowed from external sources and other internal segments, premises expenses, personnel 
costs, other direct overheads and allocated expenses of delivery channels, specialist product groups, processing units

All items which are reckoned at an enterprise level are classified under this segment. This includes capital and reserves, 
debt classified as Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital and other unallocable assets and liabilities such as deferred tax, prepaid 
expenses, etc.
Segment revenue includes earnings from external customers plus earnings from funds transferred to other segments. Segment 
result includes revenue less interest expense less operating expense and provisions, if any, for that segment. Segment-wise 
income and expenses include certain allocations. Interest income is charged by a segment that provides funding to another 
segment, based on yields benchmarked to an internally approved yield curve or at a certain agreed transfer price rate. 
Transaction charges are levied by the retail banking segment to the wholesale banking segment for the use by its customers 
of the retail banking segment’s branch network or other delivery channels. Segment capital employed represents the net

25 COVID-19
 
HDFC Bank Limited
The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic had led to a nation-wide lockdown in April-May 2020. This was followed by localised 
lockdowns in areas with a significant number of COVID-19 cases. Following the easing of lockdown measures, there was an 
improvement in economic activity in the second half of fiscal 2021. Since then India experienced two waves of the COVID-19 
pandemic following the discovery of mutant coronavirus variants, leading to the reimposition of regional lockdowns which 
were subsequently lifted. 
The impact of COVID-19, including changes in customer behaviour and pandemic fears, as well as restrictions on business 
and individual activities, led to significant volatility in global and Indian financial markets and a significant decrease in global and 
local economic activities. The disruptions following the outbreak, impacted loan originations, the sale of third party products, 
the use of credit and debit cards by customers and the efficiency in collection efforts resulting in increase in customer defaults 
and consequent increase in provisions there against.
India is emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent to which any new wave of COVID-19 will impact the bank's results 
will depend on ongoing as well as future developments, including, among other things, any new information concerning the 
severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any action to contain its spread or mitigate its impact whether government mandated 
or elected by us.
 
HDFC Securities Limited
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a considerable impact on economic activities across the various parts of the 
country and across the globe. The Government of India and various state governments have introduced a series of initiatives 
over the past year including lockdowns in order to contain the impact of the virus. 
Stock broking and depository services have been declared as essential services all through the year and accordingly, the 
Company has faced no business stoppage / interruption on account of the lockdown. As of March 31, 2022, based on facts 
and circumstances existing as of that date, the Company does not anticipate any material uncertainties which affects its 
liquidity position and also ability to continue as a going concern.
26 Refund / Adjustment of ‘interest on interest’
In accordance with the instructions in the paragraph 5 of the RBI circular dated April 07, 2021, the Group refunded / adjusted 
'interest on interest' of ` 302.45 crore to all eligible borrowers during the year ended March 31, 2022.
27 Additional disclosure
Additional statutory information disclosed in the separate financial statements of the Bank and subsidiaries have no material 
bearing on the true and fair view of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the information pertaining to such items which

Commodity Price Risks and Foreign Exchange 
Risks and Hedging activities
Being in the business of banking, as per the extant regulations, 
the Bank does not deal in any commodity, though, it can be 
exposed to the commodity price risks in its capacity as lender / 
banker to its customers. Currently, the Bank has open exposure 
in Precious Metals i.e, Gold / Silver and such open exposures in 
Gold / Silver are primarily on account of positions created from 
short term deposits under the Gold Monetisation Scheme (GMS) 
raised from Customers and trading positions in Gold / Silver. 
These positions are managed similar to other foreign exchange 
exposures using spot, outright forwards and swap transactions 
in Gold/Silver and monitored as part of the trading portfolio within 
the stipulated trading risk limits viz. Net overnight open position 
limit, Intraday open position limit, Value-at-Risk limit, Stop Loss 
Trigger Level etc. that are defined in the Treasury Limits Package. 
In addition, Bank is authorized by Reserve Bank of India to 
import gold and silver and the exposure arising out of import 
of gold and silver on consignment basis is covered on back to 
back basis. The spot, forward and swap contracts, outstanding 
as on the Balance Sheet date and held for trading, are revalued 
at the closing spot and forward rates respectively as notified by 
FEDAI (Foreign Exchange Dealers’ Association of India) and at 
interpolated rates for contracts of interim maturities. The USD/ 
INR rate for valuation of contracts having longer maturities i.e. 
greater than one (1) year is implied from the applicable INR and 
USD swap curves. For other pairs, where the rates / tenors 
are not published by FEDAI, the spot and forward points are 
obtained from Refinitiv or Bloomberg for valuation of the foreign 
exchange deals. The foreign exchange profit or loss is arrived on 
present value basis thereafter, as directed by FEDAI, whereby the 
forward profits or losses on the deals, as computed above, are 
discounted till the valuation date using the applicable discounting 
yields. The resulting profit or loss on valuation is recognized in 
the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Given below are the exposure details of the Bank under the Gold 
Monetisation Scheme deposits as of March 31, 2022.

shares in demat mode are requested to update with their 
respective Depository Participants, their correct core banking 
account number, including 9 digit MICR Code and 11 digit 
IFSC Code, e-mail ID and Mobile No(s). This will facilitate the 
remittance of the dividend amount as directed by SEBI directly 
in the bank account electronically. Updation of e-mail IDs and 
Mobile No(s) will also enable sending communication relating to 
credit of dividend, unencashed dividend etc.
Shareholders holding shares in physical form may communicate 
details relating to their core banking account, viz., core banking 
account number, including 9 digit MICR Code and 11 digit IFSC

available in its records on the said dividend warrant to avoid 
fraudulent encashment of the warrants. The dividend warrant 
will be dispatched by the R&T agent at the registered address

Deduction of tax at source on dividend
In terms of the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961, (“the Act”), 
dividend paid or distributed by a company on or after April 1, 
2020 is taxable in the hands of the shareholders. The company 
shall therefore be required to deduct tax at source at the time 
of payment of dividend. The deduction of tax at source will be 
based on the category of shareholders and subject to fulfilment 
of conditions as provided herein below:
For Resident shareholders
Tax will be deducted at source (“TDS”) under Section 194 of the 
Act @ 10% on the amount of dividend payable unless exempt 
under any of the provisions of the Act. However, in case of 
resident shareholders, TDS would not apply if the aggregate of 
total dividend distributed/paid to them by the company during a 
financial year does not exceed ` 5,000.
Tax will not be deducted at source in cases where a shareholder 
provides Form 15G (applicable to all individuals) / Form 15H 
(applicable to an individual above the age of 60 years), provided 

Shareholder Information
that the eligibility conditions are satisfied. Please note that all 
fields mentioned in the aforesaid forms are mandatory 
and the Bank may reject the forms submitted, if they do 
not fulfil the requirement of the law. 
Needless to mention, valid Permanent Account Number (“PAN”) 
will be mandatorily required. Shareholders who are required 
to link Aadhaar number with PAN as required under Section 
139AA(2) read with Rule 114AAA, should compulsorily link the 
same. If, as required under the law, any PAN is found to have not 
been linked with Aadhaar, then such PAN will be inoperative and 
tax would be deducted at a higher rate under Section 206AA 
of the Act. The Bank reserves its right to recover any demand 
raised subsequently on the Bank for not informing the Bank 
or providing wrong information about applicability of Section 
206AA in your case.

must be ensured that self-declaration should be addressed to 
HDFC Bank and should be in the prescribed format. In absence

DTAA rate at the time of tax deduction on dividend.
