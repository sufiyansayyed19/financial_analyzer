is characterised by its unwavering 
dedication to delivering superior

Chairman's Message
Dear Stakeholders,
Greetings!
It gives me immense pleasure to 
present to you the Integrated Annual 
Report of our Bank for the financial 
year 2022-23.
The year 2022-23 gone by was a 
momentous year in many ways. It 
was a year in which the world largely 
shook off the effects of the COVID-19 
pandemic thus enabling Governments, 
businesses and people to rebound 
in their activities with renewed zest 
and make fresh beginnings and 
investments. At the same time, quite 
unexpectedly, it was the year when 
the world was buffeted by a surging 
geopolitical turmoil, burgeoning 
energy prices and inflation, and the 
inevitable tightening of the monetary 
policies around the globe. Despite 
global headwinds, the Indian economy 
continued to demonstrate resilience. 
The runway for growth in India, 
predominantly driven by the country’s 
domestic consumption, remains 
immense. Global investors and India 
watchers have acknowledged the 
country’s macroeconomic and 
financial stability.
For us at HDFC Bank, the year started 
with a path breaking announcement 
of the merger of our promoter, HDFC 
Ltd., one of the largest housing finance 
companies of India with the Bank. 
This merger was meant to, inter-alia, 
transform the Bank to a financial 
services conglomerate straddling 
key financial services and products, 
including housing loan, life and general 
insurance, and asset management 
amongst others.
The merged entity would benefit 
from increased scale, comprehensive 
product offering, balance sheet 
resilience and the ability to drive 
synergies, enhance operating 
efficiencies and underwriting 
efficiencies, thereby leveraging the 
complementary strengths of both 
the organisations. This would enable 
the Bank to serve its customers in 
a significantly enhanced way with a 
bouquet of financial services.
I am happy to inform you that the 
merger has now been completed 
within our estimated timelines and 
focus now shifts on capturing the 
full benefits of the synergies and 
future proofing the Bank for the 
coming decades.
The Integrated Annual Report being 
placed before you would once again 
demonstrate that the Bank has 
achieved over the past financial year, 
robust growth in its businesses with 
healthy financial performance and 
profitability, and it continues to be one 
of the best managed banks in terms of 
its risk management, non-performing 
assets, regulatory compliance and 
governance standards. This reflects 
the effectiveness of our governance 
culture and the supervision of the 
Board. Let me elaborate on 
these themes.
Governance at the core
At the Bank we accord tremendous 
importance to very high standards of 
corporate governance. This philosophy 
rests on the essential principles 
of independence, accountability, 
responsibility, transparency, fair 
and timely disclosures which have 
built credibility over the years. The 
various Committees of the Board met 
throughout the year giving them an 
opportunity to take stock of various 
aspects of critical importance to the 
Bank. These Committees enabled 
the Board members to perform 
their governance and supervisory 
duties and have an oversight on the 
performance of senior management. 
This ensured that your Bank would not 
be buffeted by sudden ebbs and flows 
of events.
We stand at the 
cusp of a New Era
Atanu Chakraborty
Part-time Chairman and 
Independent Director 
HDFC Bank Limited

Review of the Bank’s 
performance and 
responsibility to society
During the year under review, the 
Bank has delivered strong growth 
while asset quality remains one of the 
best in the industry. The details of our 
performance are captured across the 
report before you.
It is important to reiterate that the 
Bank recognises its responsibility 
to the community and society quite 
seriously. This was reflected last 
year as we emerged as a leading 
contributor in Government schemes, 
particularly those which helped the 
nation emerge out of the pandemic. 
We were the largest participant under 
the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee 
Scheme (ECLGS) disbursing over 
C44,000 Crore and supporting about 
1.25 Lakh MSMEs. In addition, 
the Bank continued to increase its 
exposure to the agricultural sector and 
weaker sections of society.
The Bank's Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) activities and 
initiatives on Environmental, Social and 
Governance (ESG) parameters remain 
important focus areas for the Board.
Future ready: adopting 
Information Technology
I am happy to inform you that the 
Bank management is focused on 
result driven investments in IT and 
digital transformation of the Bank and 
the Committees of the Board spend 
considerable time in the evaluation of 
the implementation of the IT strategy 
of the Bank. Over the last year we 
have focused on strengthening our 
core IT infrastructure in terms of high 
availability, capacity additions ahead 
of time, new Disaster Recovery site 
implementation, moving towards hybrid 
cloud architecture etc. All this enables 
us to ensure that we are able to run 
the Bank and provide our customers 
the convenience of availability of our 
services round the clock.
Harnessing the Power of One
During the last year, we indicated a 
timeline of 12 to 18 months for the 
merger process to conclude and we 
have completed the merger within the 
indicated timelines. Executing a merger 
of this scale and complexity would 
not have been possible without the 
immense support and co-operation 
received from the Government of India, 
Reserve Bank of India, Competition 
Commission of India, Securities and 
Exchange Board of India, Insurance 
Regulatory and Development Authority 
of India, National Company Law 
Tribunal and all the other agencies. 
They have helped us navigate through 
the complexities of this merger and 
on behalf of the Board of Directors of 
HDFC Bank, I extend a deep sense of 
gratitude to all of them.
I would also like to thank 
Shri Deepak Parekh for the role 
he has played in nurturing HDFC 
and its group companies with great 
passion and commitment over four 
and a half decades.
The Bank is now fully poised to 
take the benefits of the merger. The 
entities have formed an Integration 
Committee that has been working on 
various streams across businesses, 
IT, HR, Risk Management, Operations, 
Compliance, etc. to make the merger 
seamless and effective. We are also 
putting in place the strategy to ensure 
that the financial conglomerate that 
has emerged has in place adequate 
systems and processes to ensure 
adherence to the various regulatory 
regimes and a governance framework 
for meeting group wide compliance 
and risk management objectives. The 
shareholders and other stakeholders 
are now part of a world class financial 
conglomerate and we expect that by 
this time next year we would be well 
positioned to see the benefits of the 
Power of One.
In conclusion, I would like to say that 
we stand at the cusp of a new era 
which will define our future; a future 
in which I have full confidence of 
demonstrating growth, stability and 
serving our burgeoning pan India 
customer base even better.

Message from the MD & CEO
For us in India, we can see that our 
economy has been resilient and we 
as a country have managed these 
after effects pretty well, by the speed 
and scale of our vaccination and the 
deft economic and monetary policy 
initiatives by the Government and the 
Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
Coming to our Bank, the year started 
with a path breaking announcement 
of our intent to merge HDFC Ltd. with 
the Bank. I am happy to report that the 
merger has come into effect from 
July 1, 2023. I will share further details 
on this significant milestone in our 
history, further down.
Macroeconomic Environment
A prominent global publication referred 
to the post-pandemic economy like 
the Mona Lisa. Each time you look, 
you see something different. It was felt 
that perhaps the world is simply more 
volatile. However, the good news for 
us is that India remained one of the 
fastest growing large economies in the 
world and an engine of global growth. 
We did not have to contend with such 
uncertainties. The Indian economy 
exhibited robust resilience in 2022-23 
recording a growth of 7.2 per cent, 
which was the highest among major 
economies of the world.
This achievement comes in a scenario 
where global economic growth is 
expected to moderate on account 
of monetary tightening in developed 
economies, the crisis in the US 
regional banking sector and the 
continuing war in Ukraine.
India is predicted to grow around 6 per 
cent in the current financial year. This 
is lower than last year’s growth but is 
still much higher than what is projected 
for many developed economies. The 
recession fears in major economies 
and expected slowdown in export 
growth means that India cannot 
remain entirely insulated from global 
pressures. However, the domestic 
resilience as reflected in 2022-23 is an 
indicator that India is likely to withstand 
future headwinds. This brings me to 
the India story.
The merger perhaps could 
not have been better timed 
Dear Stakeholders,
Warm greetings to you all.
The year gone by was one in 
which the world moved away 
from the new normal to the 
normal. The pandemic is largely 
over. However, the after effects 
of decisions made during those 
trying and unusual times have 
left behind a lot of issues for the 
world to address. This includes 
higher inflation and resultant 
monetary tightening, and the 
regional banking crisis in Europe 
and USA.
Sashidhar Jagdishan
Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer 
HDFC Bank Limited

The India Story
What is the India story? It is a story of 
demographics, education, digitisation, 
rising incomes and aspirations and 
geopolitical developments coming 
together to give the country a once 
in a lifetime opportunity. It starts 
with demographics. About half our 
population is below the age of 35. 
India’s working age population (15-64 
years) is expected to rise and peak 
close to 65 per cent by 2030 and 
thereafter stabilise. The proficiency 
of Indians in Science, Technology, 
Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) 
coupled with their felicity with the 
English language gives India a clear 
differentiator.
Next comes the Government’s rollout 
of digital infrastructure - the largest 
such in the world. The result is that 
India has taken the lead when it 
comes to digital transactions. More 
than 40 per cent of these transactions 
are from India. This also fuels further 
aspirations as the Internet is a clear 
leveller when it comes to information. 
Through mobiles, laptops, PCs, and 
social media, Indians have similar 
access to information in major cities 
and in the heartland. This in turn is 
being backed by increasing purchasing 
power with a per capita income of 
$2,000. So, the demand for consumer 
goods and financial services is 
expected to increase exponentially. 
The other consumption enabler is the 
Government’s rationalisation of income 
tax slabs which will put more money 
in the hands of people in lower income 
brackets. On the investment side, 
the increase in Government capital 
expenditure should crowd in private 
sector investment as well. Global 
geopolitical developments too favour 
India. All these create the necessary 
climate for India to get a much larger 
share of the foreign investment pie, 
emerge as a global production hub 
and become an $8 trillion economy 
in about a decade, from $3.5 trillion. 
Naturally, this also acts as an enabler 
for growth in financial services which 
is under penetrated and underserved. 
India’s housing story will also feed off 
this growth and the merger could not 
have perhaps come at a better time.
The Merger
Last year I had explained the rationale 
for the merger. To quickly recapitulate, 
this was an opportunity that we truly 
believed in. Buying a home is a family 
decision and an emotional one. This 
emotion is transferred to the home 
loan service provider and helps build 
lifelong bonds with the customer and 
his family. Also, only 2 per cent of our 
customers source their home loans 
through the Bank, while 5 per cent do 
it from other institutions. This itself is a 
huge opportunity.
It is this bond with the customer 
that the Bank would like to build on. 
HDFC Bank with its stronger digital 
platforms, digital journeys and physical 
branch network will have the ability 
to offer the home loan customer a 
complete bouquet of the Bank’s and 
subsidiaries’ products and services. 
Savings accounts, personal loans, 
insurance cover, SIPs can all be 
bundled along with a home loan to 
create a compelling value proposition 
to the customer, that probably does 
not exist in the market at the scale at 
which this is envisaged. Going forward 
this is clearly going to be a game 
changer.
As India grows, home buying across 
the country will only accelerate and 
emerge as a key driver of India’s GDP 
over the next decade, especially 
affordable housing. Investments 
in infrastructure are vital for India’s 
growth. A bigger balance sheet postmerger will enable HDFC Bank to take 
a larger exposure in infrastructure 
HDFC Bank with its stronger digital platforms, 
digital journeys and physical branch network will 
have the ability to offer the home loan customer a 
complete bouquet of the Bank’s and subsidiaries' 
products and services.

Message from the MD & CEO
In my letter to you in the last two years, 
I had highlighted my key focus areas. 
These are: improving technology 
resilience, a clear focus on three Cs: 
Culture, Conscience and Customer 
and building for the future.
Let me now elaborate on these.
Technology Update:
HDFC Bank is today in the midst of 
a technology transformation exercise 
that focuses both on building the Bank 
of the future as well as running the 
Bank. For me, the focus on technology 
upgrade and digital transformation are 
central to achieving growth as well as 
excellence in customer service.
We are focusing on two foundational 
aspects. First, transforming the Bank 
through new platforms and customer 
experiences offered by the best-inclass products and services through 
our digital factories. Second, running 
the Bank efficiently by reinforcing our 
core technologies with enhanced 
performance and resilience at scale, 
through the enterprise factory. Our 
digital transformation journey is being 
powered by building competencies 
within the Bank. The factory approach 
is focused on leveraging new-age 
tech such as AI/ML, cloud-native 
architecture, API-driven banking 
as well as pioneering industryfirst initiatives through emerging 
technologies such as generative AI 
enablement across banking domains.
Some of our flagship programmes 
focused on our customers are 
enumerated below:
• Our modernised PayZapp 2.0 
arrives with a variety of quality-oflife improvements while offering 
convenience, security, and a 
wide array of payment options at 
customers’ fingertips. This will drive 
our acquisition of New To Bank 
customers.
• SmartHub has grown into the 
preferred banking platform for 
merchants with over 1.5 million 
using the app, handling over 18 lakh 
transactions daily.
• Our Bank One Program is a 
cloud-native platform powered by 
conversational AI & ML capabilities 
offering our customers a unified 
banking experience across channels. 
With multilingual bots covering ~40 
per cent of customer interactions, 
the platform has significantly boosted 
efficiencies and reduced resolution 
times.
• Our Acquisition Platform enables 
a smoother and more consistent 
customer experience for purchase 
of the Bank’s retail products on the 
Bank’s platforms and has facilitated 
more than 5 million products being 
availed by our customers.
• Xpress Car Loan has evolved 
into India’s single largest digital 
loan platform for origination and 
disbursement with over 50,000 
happy customers.
• Smart Saathi, our most recent 
launch, digitally enables our network 
of Business Correspondents and 
Business Facilitators by providing 
them an omnichannel experience of 
our digital products.
• The Bank has driven various industryfirst innovations through programmes 
such as Digital Cattle Finance, Digital 
Rupee, OfflinePay, Digi-Passbook, 
exploration of AI / ML based data 
extraction and signature verification.
• On the Corporate Banking front, 
the Bank hosts Corporate Banking 
eXchange (CBX) which is one of 
the largest corporate transactions 
platforms and a state-of-the-art Trade 
Finance platform.
Our conscious effort has been 
to launch in small scale, listen to 
customer feedback, build acceptance 
projects. This means we can 
participate more meaningfully in India’s 
growth story and contribute to nation 
building. In light of all this, the pace at 
which we aim to grow - we could be 
creating a new HDFC Bank every 
4 years.
The merger would of course not have 
been possible without the support and 
guidance of the regulatory authorities 
including RBI, SEBI, CCI, IRDAI, BSE, 
NSE, PFRDA and NCLT. I would like to 
take this opportunity to thank all 
of them.
Now, to come to our performance.
Our Performance
As a Bank our performance has been 
consistent across business cycles. We 
have grown our Balance Sheet and 
Net Profit while maintaining our 
asset quality.
Our Balance Sheet grew by 19.2 per 
cent to `24,66,081 crore and Net Profit 
increased 19.3 per cent to `44,108.7 
crore. Net Interest Income increased 
by 20.6 per cent to `86,842.2 crore. 
GNPA decreased to 1.12 per cent 
from 1.17 per cent. We have been able 
to maintain a stable NIM at 4.1 per 
cent (4.3 per cent on interest earning 
assets) despite deposits growing 
by 20.8 per cent on account of low 
cost of funds. The Return on Assets 
(ROA) was 2.07 per cent while Return 
on Equity was 17.4 per cent. Our 
commitment to shareholders remained 
high with a proposed dividend pay-out 
of `19 per equity share of `1/- which 
translates to a dividend pay-out ratio 
of 24.07 per cent of the profits for the 
financial year ended March 31, 2023.
I am pleased to state that the Bank’s 
performance continued to be robust 
during FY 2022-23 with sustained 
growth across the Wholesale, Retail 
and Commercial and Rural Banking 
businesses.

through word of mouth before we fully 
scale. We will continue to invest in 
technology for improving our customer 
experience.
Parallelly, our core technology is 
being reinforced through the power of 
cloud for improved resilience, scale, 
and agility. We have migrated our 
data centres to new state-of-the-art 
facilities in Mumbai and Bengaluru. 
We continue to focus on upgrading 
our infrastructure with an Active-Active 
architecture for greater availabilities 
and high-performance apps. The 
'Hollowing the Core' programme is 
set to transform the way core banking 
is operated. Basis the investments 
made, we have seen a significant 
improvement in our resilience and 
uptime (basis both internal and 
external public sources) metrics. 
However, we are not perfect and we 
will continue to further strengthen our 
core IT infrastructure.
Our competency factories are 
maturing into innovation labs and 
are increasingly partnering with the 
Government institutions and FinTechs 
to develop prototypes of the next 
wave of digital banking products. For 
instance, we are leveraging generative 
AI for structured and unstructured data 
extraction from documents, developing 
AI-based instant credit decisioning 
models and significantly improving 
fraud monitoring through real-time selfmonitoring ML models.
Attracting and developing the best 
engineering talent with new-age tech 
skill sets is a top priority for us to lead 
into the next age of neo-banking. The 
Bank is strategically positioning itself to 
capitalise on new opportunities which 
are poised to revolutionise banking 
and is making technology investments 
for the future. A steady growth of 
strategic investments in emerging 
tech and partnerships will ensure that 
HDFC Bank stays ahead of the curve 
in driving innovations and industry 
benchmarks.
Customer Centricity, Service 
First Culture and People
Every decision of ours is an endeavour 
to increase the benefits it brings to our 
stakeholders.
A service first culture has always been 
one of the anchors of the Bank’s 
growth story. It starts with taking care 
of our employees who in turn take care 
of our customers.
I have personally travelled across 
the country in private buses, with 
colleagues across levels travelling 
with me. This has given me the 
opportunity to meet employees as well 
as customers across multiple locations 
in the country. These interactions 
have enriched my understanding and 
view of the locations visited and the 
myriad opportunities that exist in this 
vast country. I am energised by the 
talent and passion that our frontline 
colleagues display during these 
interactions and also give us enough 
ideas to work on. This is something 
I will continue.
In order to institutionalise and measure 
a Service First Culture, we have 
implemented an at scale episodic 
bottom-up Net Promoter System 
(NPS). This allows us to get a real 
time customer feedback on their 
interactions with the Bank and helps 
us draw up plans to keep improving 
in the areas where we are still not 
up to the mark. I am happy to report 
a consistent increase in our Net 
Promoter Score for the Bank as a 
whole, year on year and this augurs 
well. I accept that we may not be 
perfect with our customer interactions 
all the time, and this is one area, I 
and the entire Bank are focused on 
improving day in and day out. We 
are digitising many of the Customer 
Service interactions at a fast pace and 
I firmly believe that this will provide the 
impetus to keep improving our Service 
First culture.
In addition, we constantly benchmark 
ourselves with our competition to learn 
and better ourselves. HDFC Bank 
continues to lead the overall brand 
NPS ranking (independent third-party 
survey) among 20+ competitors in the 
banking category for the second year 
in a row.
We have also developed a unique 
Service Quality Index (SQI) for our 
key customer facing channels which 
measures the performance of these 
channels on critical customer service 
parameters and helps improve on the 
same.
The complaints trend indicates 
that digital frauds are increasing, 
particularly targeting a vulnerable 
section of consumers. We are 
committed to help safeguard 
customers by way of increasing 
awareness amongst people and 
improving our technology tools.
The initiative of Vigil Aunty to promote 
awareness amongst customers about 
cyber frauds has been well received 
and we would further invest in this 
area. In terms of technology 
investments to prevent frauds, 
the Bank has invested in wrapper, 
device binding, device assurance and 
multi-factor authentication and would 
continue to invest to protect our 
customers.
As a Bank we are making progress on 
our Customer Service, but I believe 
that this journey has to be accelerated 
every year. More remains to be done 
and I am fully committed to improving 
our customer centricity further.
A Service First culture is not possible 
without an organisational culture that 
acts as the foundation for the same. 
Let me dwell on this here.

Culture
Culture defines the experience of 
each employee. Managers are in 
the unique position to represent the 
culture the Bank stands for. Talent, 
Potential and Capabilities can best 
be harnessed through an enabling 
culture. Towards this the Bank has 
adopted the managerial behaviour 
architecture - Nurture, Care and 
Collaborate. This encapsulates what 
we espouse in our Culture Framework 
– the HDFC Bank Way and translates it 
into simple behaviours that managers 
can demonstrate in their interactions 
with their teams. The Nurture, Care, 
Collaborate initiative that covered over 
12,000+ managers in the previous year 
was extended to the senior leadership 
levels and over 6,000 new managers 
in FY 2022-23. The intent is to have 
all managers at the Bank equipped to 
fully live the cultural ethos of the Bank.
I am fully conscious of the fact that 
there may be instances where some 
people managers might transgress 
our defined way of working. We have 
the resolve to nip this in the bud, both 
by way of training/counselling and 
appropriate action, to ensure that 
the same is not attempted by anyone 
else. Having said that, we have some 
distance to traverse on this front. We 
are taking concrete steps towards 
building an INCLUSIVE organisation, 
which will go a long way in reining in 
attrition in the coming years.
The Bank has experienced an increase 
in attrition over the last financial year 
and a significant part of which was 
in the ‘non-supervisory staff’ levels 
(which includes Sales Officers). 
One reason that can be attributed 
towards this increase, is a postCOVID phenomenon, that may have 
prompted the younger workforce to 
recalibrate what they ‘want from their 
lives’. This has led to increased attrition 
across all sectors. It is a reality that all 
major employers are grappling with, 
especially in the BFSI sector.
However, we are cognizant that the 
experience of working with HDFC 
Bank can be better on several counts, 
especially culture. The Bank upholds 
RESPECT for ALL as a fundamental 
tenet in the way we work with each 
other and our customers.
Listening is vital to understanding 
the sentiment of an organisation and 
thus we launched Pulse, a real time 
feedback platform for employees to 
share candid feedback. This platform 
is completely anonymous, and we’ve 
already launched 20 surveys to check 
the sentiment of the employees 
on topics like Work Life Harmony, 
Pleasant Parenthood, Future Banker 
Program and Onboarding Experience, 
to name a few. We continue to listen, 
learn, and act on the feedback so that 
we can improve our work environment 
and people practices in order to 
provide space for all our employees to 
excel, thrive and have a long, fulfilling 
career at the Bank.
Skilling our people continuously is 
another important area that I am 
focused on. We challenge people 
with continuous job rotations and 
assignments outside of their core 
areas, along with on the job and 
specialised training where needed.
We will continue to do more on 
this path.
Building for the Future
In the last two years, I have spoken 
about Project Future Ready, to 
catalyse, create and capture the next 
wave of growth. The following growth 
engines had been identified: Corporate 
Banking, Commercial (MSME) 
and Rural Banking, Government 
and Institutional Business, Wealth 
Management, Retail Assets and 
Payments, to be driven by our delivery 
channels of Branch Banking, TeleSales/Service/Relationship and Digital 
Marketing. These can be categorised 
as Business Verticals and Delivery 
Channels. Underlying all this will be our 
technology and digital platforms.
We have seen progress in our strategy. 
The Commercial and Rural Banking 
loans have grown by 29.8 per cent. 
Your Bank is today the largest SME 
Bank in the country and has grown 
this book by adhering to stringent 
underwriting standards.
We have grown the Corporate and 
other Wholesale loans by 12.6 per 
cent while maintaining a healthy 
ROA. We have expanded our wealth 
management services to over 900 
locations. Our domestic retail loans 
have grown by 20.8 per cent without 
compromising on asset quality. Our 
payments business continues to 
perform well, and we continue to enjoy 
a leadership position there.
Branch Banking is the fulcrum of our 
customer relationships, and we believe 
that a physical branch is extremely 
important to customers especially in 
semi urban and rural locations. In FY 
2022-23, we added a record 1,479 
branches, a majority of which are in 
semi urban and rural (SURU) locations. 
We plan to add another 675 this year in 
SURU locations that will take the total 
number of branches in these locations 
to over 5,000. Overall, the Bank plans 
to add 1,500 to 2,000 additional 
branches during the year. The concept 
of phygital branches will help us to 
be agile in meeting customer needs 
through digital transactions and at the 
same time give customers a sense 
of engagement and security with a 
physical touchpoint. Going forward, 

the new branches, we believe, will be 
key to additional deposit mobilisation.
An increasing customer base needs 
to be engaged and managed and our 
investment on Virtual Relationship 
Management is delivering on what we 
are building it for.
Digital Marketing has helped 
increase the traffic by 35 per cent 
on our digital properties. The traffic 
has been harnessed leveraging 
advanced analytics and our new 
digital acquisition platform, resulting 
in direct business generation across 
all retail products of the Bank, selling 
directly more than 3.8 million products. 
I expect the pace of growth of this 
channel to further increase and also 
encompass practically all service 
interactions as we move forward.
Our technology transformation 
initiatives coupled with our core 
enabling functions of Internal Audit, 
Credit and Underwriting, Risk 
Management and Compliance/
Governance continue to be integral to 
the health and growth of the Bank.
Environment, Social and 
Governance Strategy (ESG)
According to the United Nations, the 
world is now warming faster than at 
any point in recorded history. While this 
calls for global action, as a Bank we 
are contributing to this in our way. Two 
years back, we committed to become 
carbon neutral by 2031-32. We have 
formulated and are implementing a 
strategy towards achieving this with 
interim milestones.
ESG is being made an integral part 
of our credit assessment process. 
Assessment of environment and 
social factors has been a part of 
credit diligence, particularly in project 
financing above a certain threshold 
for many years now. This has been 
strengthened further through a 
comprehensive ESG and Climate 
Change assessment framework 
in corporate lending. This is still at 
an early stage as right now we are 
focused on increasing awareness 
among our corporate borrowers and 
understanding where they are in their 
ESG journey. Going forward, we would 
be looking to make it one of the key 
criteria in credit decisioning. In the 
last financial year, we have financed 
6,110 MW of renewable energy 
capacity. Over 940 of our branches 
have been green certified and all our 
future branches will conform to green 
building standards. The overarching 
vision is in place for ESG, and we 
continue to make steady progress on 
this.
Not only do we believe in leading 
responsibly but are also committed 
to being responsible social citizens. 
Through our CSR initiatives under 
Parivartan, we have potentially 
impacted over 9.93 crore lives. In 
FY 2022-23, around 500 projects 
were executed through 250+ 
Implementation Partners spread 
across 27 states of the country. The 
impact of our projects is tracked 
internally and externally through impact 
assessment studies.
We continue to take affirmative steps 
towards being a more inclusive 
organisation. The Bank is committed 
to fostering Diversity and Inclusion. 
We have prioritised our focus on 
two aspects of diversity - Gender 
and Persons with Disabilities (PwD). 
Women comprising 25 per cent of our 
workforce by 2025 is an aspiration 
that we are actively pursuing. We have 
been steadily making progress towards 
this goal and 23 per cent of our 
colleagues are women. We continue to 
maintain gender equity with respect to 
pay, promotions and elevations.
Good corporate governance is a 
product of culture and conscience, 
and this is vital for the long-term 
sustainability of the organisation. Our 
focus on compliance and assurance 
functions is unwavering and we 
continue to strengthen the checks and 
balances through these.
Conclusion
The year started with the 
announcement of the intent to merge 
with HDFC Ltd. This has now been 
concluded within the anticipated 
timelines. While this gives the Bank a 
strong runway for future growth, it also 
helps us contribute to nation building 
by helping more Indians buy a home 
and secure jobs. And yes, help the 
economy grow further.
I end by expressing my heartfelt 
gratitude to our Board members 
for their guidance, supervision, 
unwavering support and belief in our 
abilities. Finally my gratitude to all my 
colleagues for their contribution not 
just for the year gone by but also for 
their efforts over the years, making the 
Bank count amongst the world’s finest 
financial institutions.

management systems, 
robust credit policy, 
and underwriting 
capabilities. We grew 
our balance sheet size 
by 19.2% in FY23, with 
a 20.8% increase in 
deposits and a 16.9% 
growth in advances. 
This was achieved 
through our extensive 
reach across our 7,821 
branches including our 
Digital Banking Units. 
Our profit after tax grew 
by 19.3% while our asset 
quality improved further 
(GNPA at 1.12%). 
The cost-to-income ratio increased 
by 3.5% over the previous year 
and stands at 40.4% for FY23. 
This is due to increase in operating 
expenses by 27.3% over the 
previous year. The increase is largely 
attributable to continued focus on 
expanding its network. The Bank 
added 1,479 branches in FY23. The 
core net interest margin remained 
steady at 4.1% on total assets.
We remain well-capitalised which 
is reflected in our capital adequacy 
ratio of 19.3%. As a responsible 
bank, we have built a substantial 
cushion against any adverse impact 
with a provision coverage ratio 
of 75.8%, up from 72.7% in the 
previous year. 
We continued to deliver value to 
shareholders, with an RoE of 17.4%. 
Our earnings per share (EPS) 
increased by 18.7% to H79.3, while 
dividend per share rose by 22.6% to 
H19.0 in FY23.

Commercial and Rural Banking 
A well-trained relationship team 
engages in frequent interactions 
with MSME customers for their 
overall banking requirements. They 
also cross-sell various products of 
the Bank and cater to the personal 
banking needs of promoters and family 
members.
In the rural segment, the Bank is 
planning to expand its services to 
2.5 Lakh villages in the next two 
years. It funds not only traditional 
agriculture but also allied activities. It 
is totally committed to furthering the 
Government’s agenda by supporting 
its various schemes be it AIF/FPO/
PMFME, and lending to small and 
marginal farmers.
HDFC Bank is the leading player in the 
commercial vehicle and commercial 
equipment financing business with its 
share increasing considerably in the 
year ended March 31, 2023. This is a 
result of the Bank’s focus on gaining 
market share by expanding into deeper 
geographies and hiring more feet on 
street. Further, the Bank is working on 
an ecosystem to expand its business 
under the Transportation Finance 
business.
The Commercial and Rural Banking 
vertical shall continue contributing 
to the Bank's growth as well as the 
nation’s growth through its bouquet of 
products and services.
Emerging growth engine
The Bank's Commercial 
and Rural Banking (CRB) 
group was set up in 
May 2021 to cater to 
the needs of the Micro, 
Small and Medium 
Enterprises (MSME), 
emerging corporates, 
commercial agriculture, 
small and marginal 
farmers, healthcare 
finance, equipment 
finance and commercial 
transport companies. 
While these are different 
businesses, the common 
thread binding them is 
that they all have a huge 
footprint in Semi Urban 
and Rural (SURU) India. 
As has the Bank with 
about half its branches 
in SURU locations. 
This vertical is also important as its 
disbursals help the Bank in meeting 
a large part of the Priority Sector 
Lending requirements, apart from it 
being a high Return On Assets (ROA) 
business group for the Bank.
CRB has been identified as a growth 
engine and was the fastest growing 
vertical for the bank in the year 
under review. A wide reach across 
geographies of the country – district 
by district and understanding of local 
level business dynamics has helped it 
in achieving growth rates that exceed 
the industry average. HDFC Bank at 
present has 7,800+ branches of which 
over 6,200+ have loans outstanding 
to MSME customers. It is the leading 
lender to MSME segment in 12 
states and among the top 3 in 20 
states across the country. The Bank 
has been the largest contributor to 
ECLGS and CGTMSE scheme for the 
year. The sourcing model through 
branch channels, existing customer 
references, and direct connect allied to 
traditional prudence is one of the key 
reasons for containing NPAs.

and expectations. It 
enables us to identify the 
issues that are material 
to creating value, as well 
as continue delivering

Stakeholder Engagement 
Listening to our stakeholders 
Stakeholder identification and 
prioritisation is crucial to meeting 
our sustainability goals and building 
trust with our stakeholders. We map 
our stakeholders based on their level 
of interest, influence, and impact, 
prioritise them based on relevance, 
and develop engagement strategies 
that meet their needs.
We have established a robust 
governance structure to oversee our 
ESG approach, comprising the CSR 
& ESG committee of the Board and 
the ESG apex council, chaired by 
the Group Head of ESG. Under the 
aegis of the apex council, the ESG 
working groups drive the Bank’s 
ESG agenda. Focusing on ESG has 
helped us enhance our reputation, 
attract customers and investors, and 
contribute to our communities 
well-being.
We are committed to conducting 
our business in a sustainable and 
responsible manner, and will continue 
to advance our ESG agenda.
Good customer service necessitates 
having an effective internal Grievance 
Redressal mechanism/framework in 
place. To address this, the Bank has 
a Grievance Redressal Policy – duly 
approved by its Board.

Materiality
An initial list of 23 material topics was 
shortlisted based on stakeholder 
engagement, data analysis, and 
benchmarking against industry peers. 
Based on internal discussions and 
brainstorming sessions with our 
relevant stakeholders, we further 
shortlisted 16 topics which were 
subsequently shared with internal and 
external stakeholders through two sets 
of customised questionnaires. In the 
first stage, the responses within each 
group were consolidated to derive the 
priorities for the respective groups. In 
the next stage, the responses across 
different buckets were consolidated by 
assigning weights to each stakeholder

Sustainable & 
Responsible 
Financing
GRI topics: GRI 2-22 
 
 
At HDFC Bank, we have adopted an enhanced and more comprehensive “ESG & Climate Change 
Assessment” framework, as a part of the overall credit assessment for its wholesale corporate 
borrowers - replacing our erstwhile “SEMS Framework” and is applicable for all borrowers where 
the Bank’s direct funded and non-funded credit exposure to the borrower exceeds H100 Crore. 
Further, the Bank is in the process of developing a “Sustainable Financing Criteria” Framework (“the 
Framework”) using Bond Principles (developed by the International Capital Markets Association 
- ICMA) and Loan Principles (developed by the Loan Market Association - LMA) as the basis for 
identification of “Sustainable Finance Segments”.
We believe in Responsible Financing and, as a rule, do not fund projects that have a negative impact 
on the environment, health, or safety. We want to make funding available for environmentally viable 
projects that help to mitigate climate change. To reduce our carbon footprint, we continue to invest 
in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. Customers are also encouraged to make "green 
banking" decisions.
Financial 
Inclusion
GRI topics: GRI 203
 
Financial inclusion is a pressing issue, and the banking sector bears the burden of serving the 
underbanked people in rural, semi-urban, and metropolitan India. We see this as an opportunity to 
broaden our reach and make our services and goods more accessible to the poorest people across 
the country. While we continue to focus on the Corporate Cluster and Government Business to 
increase penetration, our business segment of Commercial (MSME) and Rural Banking is wellpositioned to capture the next wave of growth. 
Asset Quality
GRI topics: GRI 2-24
 
 
 
 
 
The Bank's business strategy is comprehensive and flexible, especially with the intent of being 
risk-responsive and opportunity-aware. The Bank's business strategy encompasses offering a wide 
range of products and services and maintaining a healthy asset quality besides digitisation and 
others.

GRI topics: GRI 305
 
 
We recognise our responsibility to help mitigate the effects of climate change as we move toward 
a low-carbon economy. At HDFC Bank, we have been recording our GHG emissions since 2010, 
and will continue to track and report our carbon footprint. Recently, we have committed to become 
carbon neutral by FY32. We continue to incorporate and scale up the use of renewable energy and 
energy management measures in our operations. 
Additionally, we recognise that climate change may have a substantial impact on our activities, and in 
this view, we have initiated steps towards implementation of TCFD recommendations.

implemented a governance framework, information security practices and a business continuity plan. 
Being in the service sector, Information Security and Data Protection are of utmost importance to 
us. An IT Director chairs the Board-level IT strategy Committee. To ensure customer privacy, we also

Systematic 
Risk 
Management
GRI topics: GRI 2-24
 
 
 
 
 
Through the effective use of processes, information, and technology, we have a multi-layered risk 
management strategy that identifies, assesses, monitors, and manages risks (credit risk, market 
risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and operational risk). A Board-approved Stress Testing Policy & 
System, which is an integral aspect of our ICAAP (Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process), 
is part of our overall risk management framework. Stress testing involves employing a variety of 
ways to determine our vulnerability to excessive yet realistically stressful work conditions. In addition, 
we use an ESG & Climate Change Assessment framework which captures various aspects of 
ESG compliance and climate change risks/mitigants in relation to the borrower, and their business 
operations as a whole. Risk exposures are actively identified and reported to the appropriate levels 
of management so that risk mitigation actions can be implemented. The risk management function is 
independent from business and reports directly to the Managing Director.

Strategy in Action
The Bank's long-term goal is to be 
the primary banker to customers 
and provide them with a wide 
range of products as well as build 
deep relationships. Our distribution 
footprint is expanding as planned 
with continued addition of branch 
network overlaying with our digital 
capabilities. Our Risk Management 
Framework has stood the test of time 
for over two decades and is one of 
our key strengths and differentiators. 
The merger of HDFC Limited and 
HDFC Bank should further enable 
the combined entity to enhance its 
engagement with customers and 
deepen customer relationships.
Our future-ready strategy
India continues to be underserved 
and underpenetrated in terms of 
financial services, presenting an 
exciting opportunity for growth in 
the financial services industry. We 
remain steadfast in our commitment 
to delivering consistent results by 
balancing quantity and quality. The 
Bank witnessed healthy growth 
across its three segments: Retail 
Banking, Commercial and Rural 
Banking, and Corporate and other 
Wholesale Banking while delivering 
consistent profitability and maintaining 
asset quality.

Looking ahead, we believe our 10 strategic pillars will continue to drive growth. The Bank continues to transform itself 
into a deeper and engaged customer-centric organisation by focusing on key priorities to drive viz., employee first, 
customer first and technology first. 
As we recognise the increasing shift 
towards digital transactions, we 
envision the transformation of retail 
branches into engagement centres. 
Rather than being solely transactional, 
branches will serve as platforms 
for meaningful conversations with 
customers. We aim to provide holistic, 
need-based financial solutions by 
leveraging our diverse range of 
products and services. To achieve 
this, we have identified the following

Micro-market focused multi 
format distribution
We are transforming branch banking 
into a multi-format model based on a 
granular micro market approach. This 
involves using a multi-variate model 
to identify high potential markets, 
considering factors such as population 
demographics, deposits and advances 
data, delinquency insights, climate 
risk assessments, and future trends. 
Branch formats may vary from fullservice phygital branches to smart 
banking lobbies or digital banking 
units with self-service kiosks, as well 
as business correspondent-based 
models. Our approach has led to an 
80% expansion in high potential pin 
codes. We closely track profitability 
and break-even for each format to 
ensure targeted investments and 
cost-effectiveness. By expanding our 
presence in identified locations through 
multiple formats, we not only increase 
our catchment area but also benefit 
from network effects. Therefore, we 
continue to invest in expanding our 
presence in identified locations through 
multiple formats.
Medium-term Goal 
(in 24 months)
To have a presence in 
• 711 Districts (Current as on 
March 2023: 697)
• 6,000 Cities/ Towns (Current as 
on March 2023: 4,080)
• Based on need-based and 
appropriate format
Customer lifecycle 
engagement and AI driven 
customer conversations
We leverage our extensive branch 
network as engagement centres to 
have high impact conversations with 
the customer to partner with them 
over the long term. We source the right 
customers through a differentiated 
go-to-market approach and engage 
in need-based conversations, offering 
tailored product propositions. Our 
relationship management architecture 
ensures continuous nurturing and 
implementation of next best actions 
aimed at fulfilling customer needs. With 
a 'service first culture', we leverage 
robust analytics and AI to suggest 
personalised recommendations based 
on customer transactions and digital 
behaviour for services and products. 
This also allows for validation from 
the relationship manager which then 
results in recommendations for the 
next best action for each customer. 
Relationship managers are also 
equipped with real-time data for 
immediate next best actions based 
on customer interactions. We are now 
looking to enter the next leg of this 
journey by leveraging the account 
aggregator model and generative AI 
capabilities to ensure that we have the 
right proposition for the right customer 
at the right time.

Some of the key improvements 
over the year include differentiated

alerts to customers on processing 
milestones. We continue to embed 
and enhance customer digital journeys 
including Insta Service Journeys, in 
sales, service and operations. Mobilefirst approach leveraging Aadhaar 
and ‘Walk Out Working’ (WOW) 
straight through journeys, are some 
of the initiatives that are helping us 
achieve significant benefits, in terms 
of improved customer experience. 
With a digital-first mission, we are 
unlocking operational efficiencies and 
cost savings while delivering customer 
delight. Going forward, we aim to build 
a paperless retail experience through 
a bouquet of customer-centric digital 
journeys that make banking simple.

Rural business growth levers
We develop curated propositions to 
address the specific needs of semiurban and rural (SURU) markets. 
Recently, we introduced 'Vishesh,' 
an industry-first rural-focused 
customer engagement management 
programme. It provides customised 
benefits like gold loan valuations, loan 
processing fee waivers, discounts on 
farm inputs, and access to agri-tech 
services. To expand our rural reach, 
we utilise business correspondents 
and innovative models like the Bank 
on Wheels. Additionally, we engage 
customers through financial literacy 
programmes and opinion leader 
engagements to foster deeper 
relationships and recognise their 
contribution to society through an 
acknowledgement initiative known as 
'Samman Samaroh'. Collaborating with 
partners such as Farmer Producer 
Organisations (FPOs) and Micro, Small, 
and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), 
enables active engagement with the 
entire ecosystem in a comprehensive 
manner.
People capability building
All the aforesaid initiatives and reimagined approach is complemented 
by a massive focus on our own 
People’s capability building through 
a sharp and targeted strategy using 
Nurture, Care and Collaborate 
approach. We are investing in 
innovative ways of learning and 
capability development using internal 
and external partners and technology 
enabled platforms for learning and 
development.

Virtual Relationship 
Management
We have strengthened our Virtual 
Relationship Management (VRM) 
channel to provide enhanced 
customer engagement and seamless 
service experiences. Our VRM 
strategy focuses on digital ease 
and personalised, need-based 
conversations. It is built on three 
pillars: Virtual Relationship, Virtual 
Sales, and Virtual Care. Virtual 
Relationship is an effective approach 
to cater to the needs of our managed 
customer base. Virtual Sales 
enables digital onboarding and KYC 
verification, and Virtual Care enables 
seamless customer service.
Our Virtual Relationship Managers 
cover the entire customer life cycle 
including saving, investing, borrowing, 
transacting, and engaging. Leveraging 
an Omnichannel Engagement 
framework, data science-driven 
interactions, and a talented pool 
of well-trained Virtual Relationship 
Managers, we have an advantage in 
VRM. Our investments in technology 
have upgraded customer-facing 
solutions, such as Interactive Voice 
Response Systems and digital 
engagement platforms like Video 
KYC, offering a world-class virtual 
engagement framework. Our Virtual 
Managers are complemented with 
various digital tools such as web chat 
with Eva (an Artificial Intelligencebased chatbot), and service 
assistance via Facebook Messenger. 
Employees and Customers are the 
capital for this business, and the 
Bank has invested heavily in training 
and development of its relationship 
managers. Training covers product 
knowledge, sales techniques, 
communication skills, compliance and 
regulatory requirements, and customer 
relationship management skills.
With structured, secure, compliant, 
and automated systems, we ensure 
customer data privacy. Our VRM 
framework provides seamless 
24/7 access to customers, aligning 
with global service standards. We 
offer automated interactive voice 
response (IVR) solutions in multiple 
languages, delivering a wide range 
of services. Through analytics-led 
product distribution, we strive to be 
the preferred bank for customers. Our 
Virtual Care approach is an extension 
of our customer-centric programme 
called 'Infinite Smiles,' aiming for 
customer satisfaction in every 
interaction.

Capturing flows from 
Government and 
Institutional (G&I) 
Business
Our efforts to grow the Government 
and Institutional business gathered 
further momentum this past year. 
The key pillars of growth for the 
business are: 
Dominance in agency 
business 
The Bank continues its dominance as 
an agency bank. We are the largest 
collector of direct taxes for CBDT1 
in India and a leading bank for GST 
collections and customs duty. 
The Bank is now live for e-Freight 
collections for Indian Railways 
across all 16 railway zones in the 
country, and for disbursement 
of pension to retired railways 
officials. 
Collaborating with 
Government of India
Further, the Bank has also signed 
a Memorandum of Understanding 
(MoU) with the Ministry of Defence, 
Government of India, for offering 
SPARSH (System for Pension 
Administration) related pension 
services. The Bank was also 
empanelled by the Small Farmers Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC) to extend 
its banking services beyond its farmers 
and traders on the Electronic National 
Agriculture Market (eNAM) platform. 
Offerings will now extend to third party 
service providers, e.g., cold storage 
operators, supporting procurement 
activities at mandis. 
Strategy in Action

Disbursing funds 
to the last mile 
The flow of funds from Finance 
Commission welfare schemes and 
Centrally Sponsored Schemes are 
tracked at all points of distribution 
down to the beneficiary level. This 
execution approach has helped the 
Bank increase its market share in 
Government business to more than 
35% this year. The Bank continues 
to contribute to the implementation 
of Government schemes across 
states through Single Nodal Agency 
(SNA) and Central Nodal Agency 
accounts held by various Government 
departments across the country. 
Second largest disbursing 
bank for the Public Financial 
Management System (PFMS) 
processing more than I75,000 
Crore under various schemes.
Digital solutions - A key 
driver of Government and 
Institutional business
The growth in Government and 
Institutional business was enhanced 
by offering value-added digital 
solutions. A solution penetrated 
account maintains two to three 
times the average monthly balance 
versus a non-penetrated account. For 
example, a gram panchayat enabled 
with solutions for tax collections has 
deposit value of 6.5X versus a nonsolution penetrated account. Likewise, 
an education institution has 30X the 
value when it is enabled with solutions 
for collections, and pay-outs. 
Launching new digital 
products 
Our CollectNow is an industry-first 
comprehensive collections solution 
that offers more than 15 online and 
offline collection options. It also 
provides unique benefits such as a 
single form for on-boarding, single 
settlement cycle for cards, UPI and 
other online offerings. Customers 
receive a single pay out report making 
reconciliation easy. The FARSight 
dashboard created by the Bank, 
especially for its Government and 
Institutional customers, is a userfriendly tool allowing them to slice 
and dice transaction data, monitor 
assigned limits, and check balances 
for various accounts under the multi–
level parent child set–up. 
Investing for the future
Keeping in line with its commitment 
to create a level playing field for 
retailers across the country, Your 
Bank has made an investment in the 
Open Network for Digital Commerce 
(ONDC). This will widen their access 
to market by enabling them with digital 
real estate. The Bank is committed 
to scaling this initiative by launching 
products that enable commerce 
through this new protocol. 
The Government and Institutional 
business has a multiplier effect on 
both the assets and the liabilities of 
the Bank. With the growing emphasis 
on digitisation of transactions and 
the Government's drive towards 
transparency, we recognise the 
immense opportunity in this segment.
Leadership in 
Payments Business
Our Payments Business is a 
fully integrated enterprise that 
encompasses the core functions of 
issuance, acceptance, and consumer 
finance, enabling us to cater to the 
unique needs of every customer 
segment. We maintain a prominent 
presence and hold a significant market 
share in the payments ecosystem 
across all three functions. 
The payments business also delivers 
significant value to the bank due to 
sheer number of customers it caters 
to. This provides us the opportunity 
to deepen relationships with existing 
customers and expand the market by 
engaging with new to bank and new to 
credit customers. Fundamentally, the 
Bank adopts an ecosystem approach 
to payments, wherein the customers 
access our payment space and are 
leveraged to build liability business as 
well as drive sticky profitability in the 
asset business. 
Issuance business provides extensive 
range of payment solutions to the 
customers in every segment. We 
have grown significantly across Credit 
Cards, Debit Cards, Prepaid Cards, 
PayZapp Wallet, EMI and EPI/Direct 
Pay. Acceptance business is all about 
building the core network connecting 
the entire payment ecosystem and 
receipts business. Our full suite of 
online and offline payment solutions 
consists of Payment gateway, UPI, 
EPI, SmartHub platform, POS/M POS, 
QR Code and Scan & Pay, among 
others. Within acceptance business,

the customer since their launch. More 
than 1.5 million merchants are using 
SmartHub Vyapar for their various 
business needs. The PayZapp 2.0 
has seen a phenomenal response 
with more than 1.1 million customers 
within 45 days of its launch. It provides 
unified experience across contactless 
payments, QR-based payments, UPI

design and cloudification. Additionally, 
we are preparing to introduce UPI Lite, 
which will have the ability to facilitate 
offline transactions. 
Taken together, the spends on Debit 
Card, Credit Card and direct account

Building competencies/CoEs 
– Developing engineering 
capabilities 
Nurture Tech Talent- Develop the 
right talent pool 
The first two streams focus on 
building the line functions through 
building customer-facing neo banking 
experiences and frictionless journeys 
backed by a resilient core and a cloud 
native architecture built for scale. 
While we still have some way to go, we 
are already seeing the benefits of the 
investments in these streams through 
some of our success stories across 
Heartland: Commercial 
and Rural
Under the Commercial and Rural 
Banking (CRB) segment, our aim is to 
support the growth and success of 
Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises 
(MSMEs) by providing access to 
credit and other financial solutions 
and services. We cater to MSMEs in 
manufacturing, exports, employment, 
retail and trade, supply chain network, 
infrastructure, commercial agriculture, 
commercial equipment and transport 
and healthcare businesses. We are 
the digital launches like PayZapp and 
SmartHub Vyapar. For more details 
refer pg 99.
The subsequent two streams focus 
on building the right competencies 
in terms of development factories 
and people capabilities. The intent is 
to build a tech thought process for 
rapid technology adoption. We have 
taken various initiatives such as AI 
enablement, instituting innovation 
lab to create rapid prototypes and 
investments in low code/no code 
platforms to enable automation 
at scale. In addition, we are also 
leveraging cloud technologies to 
enhance operational efficiencies and 
deliver uninterrupted services to our 
customers. This involves, hollowing the 
core, building active-active architecture 
and branch transformation efforts. For 
more details refer pg 98.
In conclusion, our Bank's technology 
and digital vision play a vital role in 
driving our future growth. We remain 
dedicated to staying at the forefront of 
technological advancements, fostering 
a culture of innovation, and developing 
the right talent to drive our tech and 
digital initiatives. By doing so, we are 
poised for continued success, enabling 
us to deliver exceptional value and 
experiences to our customers in an 
increasingly digital world.
committed to resolving challenges 
such as limited credit access, high 
borrowing costs, and collateral 
constraints that are faced by this 
sector. Our lending activities under 
this segment play a significant role in 
meeting our Priority Sector Lending 
(PSL) obligations. The CRB segment 
not only contributes to profitability of 
the Bank but also aids in achieving its 
inclusion goals, with over 70% of the 
core PSL for the Bank as on March 31, 
2023 contributed by the CRB group. 
The goals in CRB are three-fold. - To 
increase PSL lending, to grow the 
book and to generate income along 
with maintaining portfolio quality. Our 
Bank’s PSL lending comprises 46% of 
our total book of which 36% is organic. 
CRB group has been clocking an 
average of approximately 29% Y-O-Y 
growth for the past eight quarters, with 
a GNPA of 1.5% which is one of the 
lowest in the industry. 
We have in place a robust growth 
strategy for all our major offerings. In 
MSME segment, we already have a 
strong presence across all states, with 
a leading market share in 13 of them. 
We are now building in granularity by 
targeting district-level leadership.

Strategy in Action

We continue to pursue agricultural 
financing and consider the portfolio an 
important wallet generator for the Bank 
in the future. We see this potential as 
trends shift from pre-crop working 
capital financing to agri infrastructure 
financing. Further as envisioned, 
we have built a strong portfolio of 
diverse offerings across high income 
agri products such as dairy and 
horticulture. Under agriculture finance, 
we currently have a presence in 1.65 
Lakh villages and we aim to reach 2.25 
Lakh villages by the end of FY24.
We are currently the no.1 in the 
transportation finance business. 
We aim to grow this multi-fold by 
Retail Assets
Our Retail Assets strategic pillar has 
three key tenets for future growth. 
Our strategy is to continually enhance 
digital offerings across all our retail 
assets to do this at prices attuned to 
our risk appetite and to consistently 
maintain our portfolio quality at high 
levels.
Our retail assets portfolio consists 
of both secured and unsecured 
lending products such as auto loans, 
personal loans, gold loans, loans 
against property and other retail loans. 
Our focus is to provide customer 
delight through in-house solutions 
that provide us a competitive edge. 
Our key indigenous digital products 
such as Xpress Car loans, 10 Second 
Personal loans, Digital loan against 
shares, and Digital loan against 
Mutual funds, among others, enable 
not only our existing customers but 
also new to bank customers to avail 
loans in a seamless manner. While 
we continue to innovate and enhance 
our digital offerings, we have ensured 
robust analytics and risk management 
capabilities to back these offerings. 
Risk Management is at the core of our 
product offerings; further there are 
offerings in new and under-penetrated 
equipment category as well as non 
equipment financing. We will do 
this by leveraging our strong OEM 
relationships, common distribution 
channels, geographies and customer 
base across our existing portfolio and 
presence. 
Digital journeys and digitisation is a 
key enabler for growth in this segment. 
We continue to digitise a major part 
of CRB business. We are digitising 
customer touchpoints, document 
collection processes, sales service 
and others, encompassing the entire 
customer journey at the Bank. We have 
enabled self-service digital capabilities 
across all our branches. Going 
forward, we aim to build capabilities 
for digital underwriting through data 
management and APIfication. 
The segment that the CRB group 
serves has a tremendous market 
potential and the Bank is in an 
excellent position to capitalise on this 
opportunity through our extensive 
reach, innovative capabilities and 
digital prowess.

robust underwriting mechanisms in 
place to support our lending decisions. 
We ensure prudent pricing across all 
products factoring in the risk.
In addition as we increase the breadth 
of our offerings, we are also conscious 
of the quality of the portfolio we build. 
A large portion of the customers we 
target have a credit score above 760. 
Our delinquency levels are one of the 
lowest in the industry despite being the 
market leader in most segments. We 
have built-in processes and controls 
and invested in our branch network 
to manage the risks associated with 
loans. We have taken specific steps in 
this regard with the intent to grow our 
Gold Loan portfolio.
Going forward, we are looking to tap 
into Government employees as a 
major target segment for our products, 
and are also excited about the New 
to Bank (NTB) 10 sec loans to be 
launched in the coming quarters.
As we move forward with the merger, 
we aim to capitalise on and retain the 
strengths of HDFC Limited combined 
with the strengths of the Bank to 
ensure a best-in-class home loan 
offering. This combination gears 
us to becoming the primary banker 
to customers across their financial 
lifecycle through the power of 
bundling. On the personal loan front, 
we aim to build the business further 
through a focus on digital offerings, 
appropriate target market identification 
and cross-selling to HDFC Limited 
customer base. 
The way forward for us is to continue 
to offer loans seamlessly across 
geographies, expanding our reach 
in semi-urban and rural markets for 
deeper penetration and maintain our 
leadership in urban areas and cities.
Strategy in Action
HDFC Bank edge for 
Corporate Cluster
Corporate Banking remains a 
steady contributor to our growth 
and profitability. Our customer base 
spans from prominent large business 
houses, multinational corporations 
(MNCs), manufacturing and service 
sector companies to public sector 
enterprises and financial institutions, 
amongst others. Our focus is on 
holistic corporate engagement and 
serving them by extending credit as 
well as by offering banking products 
and solutions that assist corporations 
in managing their entire financial 
business cycle. Our corporate 
touchpoints encompass the gamut of 
their banking needs including working 
capital and term loans at the inception 
of a project, operational solutions such 
as cash management, supply-chain 
integration, international trade financing 
and payment solutions such as tax 
management and payroll management. 
Our comprehensive range of 
products and services along with our 
relationship approach provides us with 
competitive advantage. 
The corporate loan book has grown 
by about 12% on a y-o-y basis. While 
we focus on growth, we ensure pricing 
discipline and are selective in the 
exposures we undertake. We have a 
well-diversified book across multiple 
industries. The average rating of the 
book is between AA to AA+.

Key Growth Drivers
We endeavour to leverage our strong 
relationships with existing customers 
to increase our wallet share. This 
entails deepening share within 
existing products as well as designing 
effective solutions across their needs 
to increase their product holding. In 
addition, we are also focussing on 
new to bank acquisitions through 
engagement with large corporates, 
targetting Government undertakings 
and MNCs to expand our reach. We 
aim to capitalise on the Government 
infrastructure push and productionlinked incentive scheme (PLI) which will 
open up incremental opportunity for 
the banking sector. We have also put 
in place a liability strategy to improve 
wallet share through our transaction 
banking, viz, cash management, 
payments, and trade solutions. Supply 
chain financing is also a key growth 
driver for the Bank. We are bolstering 
this through the use of technology 
such as our supply chain platform 
that acts as a one-stop shop for 
transaction needs, as well as the 
development of need-based offerings. 
In the current year, we have embarked 
on strategic digital transformation 
to further widen and deepen wallet 
share from Corporates by enhancing 
Employee Experience (EX), Customer 
Engagement (CE) and creating an 
ecosystem for seamless banking. We 
are enhancing employee experience 
through the launch of platforms 
enabling an end-to-end journey for 
the relationship managers, actionable 
analytics, pricing intelligence and 
dashboard automation. On the 
customer front, we are shifting from 
a product focus to an ecosystem 
approach and investing in enabling 
ERP integration across functions. 
Through these initiatives, we are 
re-imagining the corporate cluster to 
function as a digital corporate bank. 
We believe the runway is long and 
our aim is to serve Corporates with 
the entire gamut of products and 
services and capitalise on the benefit 
of synergies across our Bank.

Expanding Wealth 
Management
Wealth Management holds significant 
importance for the Bank, and we 
have prioritised catering to the Super 
Affluent and Mass Affluent customer 
segments to drive growth. It's worth 
noting that a significant portion of 
wealth in India is spread across 
not just the top 30 cities but also 
beyond them. Further the growth in 
annual income at all levels is a huge 
opportunity for Wealth Management. 
To tap into this potential, the Bank is 
actively working towards expanding its 
wealth relationship team and extending 
its presence in B30 (beyond top 30) 
cities through a hub and spoke model. 
In the current year, the Bank grew 
its reach and is serving 1.41 Lakh 
customers across 923 locations with 
an active AUM of exceeding H4,30,000 
Crore including MF AUM of H73,000 
Crore. By FY24 we plan to reach more 
than 1,200 locations across India. We 
will be serving our customer segments 
through any of the touchpoints best 
suited to their needs, which includes 
physical, virtual, or digital engagement 
channels. 
On the back of the Customer First 
and Service First Culture, the Bank 
follows a three-pronged approach 
to wealth management focusing 
on the relationship manager, the 
service relationship manager, and the 
investment analyst. The relationship 
manager acts as a single point of 
contact for the customer while the 
service relationship manager enables 
a service first culture catering to all 
the service needs of the customer. 
The investment analyst also plays 
a key role through robust research 
and review of asset allocation and 
portfolio management, thus ensuring 
wealth creation. We are making deep 
investments in the development of 
talent across all three categories to 
ensure future-ready employees to 
serve our entire spectrum of clients.
As part of the overall Bank priority 
of technology-first, we are investing 
extensively in digital assets. Our 
soon to be launched enhanced 
SmartWealth app aims to provide 
intuitive end-to-end consumer wealth 
creation journey. The app will enable 
goal setting, automated risk profiling, 
curated recommendations for asset 
allocation, seamless investments 
and transactions, management of 
investment portfolio and regular 
monitoring. It is visioned to be a 
mass market app catering to diverse 
customer segments. Our objective is to 
provide a personalised experience that 
democratises wealth management, 
ensuring accessibility for all our 
customers.
Strategy in Action

Digital Marketing
Our digital marketing strategy focuses 
on creating brand awareness and 
building brand loyalty for our financial 
solutions and services. It also aims to 
convert the purchasing behaviour of 
our customers to adopt unassisted 
digital journeys both for improving 
customer experience as well as saving 
costs to the Bank. To achieve this, we 
deeply analyse customer behaviour 
and preferences, identify cohorts for 
pitching the most relevant products 
services, personalise their experiences 
on our digital properties to create 
consideration and when customers 
show a high purchase intent, provide 
them with frictionless customer 
journeys to conclude a sale. Our goal 
is to address customer requirements 
with the right product, at the right 
time, and through their preferred 
communication channel. 
By executing this strategy, we aim 
to improve our direct contribution to 
business generation. Evidence of our 
success can be seen in the growth of 
customer visits to our website/digital 
properties and completion of product 
purchase journeys. To implement 
our strategy effectively, we utilise an 
omni-channel approach, leveraging 
our digital properties (website, Net and 
MobileBanking), notifications, SMS, 
email, WhatsApp, and paid media 
including social media. 
Our communication is based on 
advanced AI/ML models to ensure 
segmentation and personalisation. 
Additionally, we invest in advanced 
analytics and data science using 
cloud-based tools to gain a deep 
understanding of customer behaviour, 
curate personalised interventions, 
and execute digital marketing plans 
at scale. We have revamped our 
digital journeys for loans, deposits, 
and payment solutions, enabling 
customers to purchase products in 
a frictionless manner. Our advanced 
analytics engine, 'Spark Beyond,' 
allows us to test hypotheses, build 
models, and understand customer 
needs for meaningful interactions 
and relationship building. To drive 
end-to-end outcome of unassisted 
business generation, we work in crossfunctional teams called PODs. These 
PODs comprising the marketing, 
business and product teams drive 
completion of purchase journeys 
leveraging data-backed analyses to 
solve business problems. Finally, we 
actively stimulate customer advocacy 
by addressing grievances, managing 
online reputation, and utilising ratings, 
reviews, and testimonials to earn 
customer trust and create brand 
advocates.
Our Robust IT and Risk management 
structure enables secured handling 
of client information which is of 
paramount importance to us.

India’s estimated GDP growth FY24
India shines in the 
midst of global 
economic volatility
Global economic growth is set to 
moderate in 2023, largely on account 
of global monetary tightening. Central 
banks are likely to keep monetary 
conditions tight through the year as 
underlying price pressures remain 
sticky and labour markets are tight 
in several advanced economies. The 
recent turmoil in the US regional 
banking sector and slower than 
expected economic recovery in China 
are other risks to the global economic 
outlook. After removing COVID-19 
related restrictions, China’s economy 
bounced back with 4.5% y-o-y GDP 
growth in Q1 2023. However, recent 
high frequency data suggests that the 
recovery momentum in China might be 
slowing.
In 2023, slowdown in developed 
economies is likely to be the major 
drag on global growth. The World 
Bank estimates global GDP growth at 
2.1% in 2023 vs. 3.1% in 2022. Growth 
in advanced economies is expected 
to slow to 0.7% in 2023 from 2.6% in 
2022, while growth in emerging market 
and developing economies is expected 
to be marginally better as compared to 
2022 (4.0% in 2023 vs. 3.7% in 2022).
On the domestic front, India’s GDP 
growth is estimated at 6.0% for 
FY24 vs. 7.2% in FY23. In FY24, 
the Government's focus on capital 
expenditure and capacity building is 
expected to support growth. On the 
external front, India’s export growth is 
expected to moderate and weigh on 
overall growth. Despite the moderation 
in growth, India is expected to remain 
the fastest growing major economy. 
Domestic inflation is expected to 
moderate below the RBI’s upper target 
of 6% in FY24, supported by easing 
supply chain pressures and pass 
through of interest rate hikes.
Globally, banking and 
non-banking sectors are 
facing challenges such 
as inflation, monetary 
policy tightening, and 
geopolitical risks. 
However, the Indian 
banking sector has 
emerged stronger on 
the back of improved 
asset quality and 
strong capital buffers. 
Policymakers remain 
mindful of evolving 
macroeconomic 
conditions that may 
impact regulated 
entities. Despite these 
challenges, India is 
expected to remain 
the fastest growing 
major economy. The 
Reserve Bank of India 
(RBI) is focusing on 
encouraging technology 
and innovation while 
containing systemic 
risks.
We conduct regular topical 
stress testing to assess the 
potential impact of geopolitical, 
macroeconomic, and sectoral 
trends. Based on the current 
information available, we do not 
foresee any significant risks arising 
out of the banking sector turmoil 
in the USA. In addition, we actively 
monitor and mitigate global and 
country-level risks. As necessary, 
we adapt our strategies and 
actions accordingly to ensure the 
ongoing stability and resilience of 
our operations.
Our Response

The Government, RBI 
are promoting banking 
innovation using 
technology
The introduction of UPI 123 Pay 
has facilitated access to the Unified 
Payments Interface (UPI) for more than 
40 Crore feature phone subscribers in 
the country. This has enabled even the 
non-smartphone users to undertake 
digital transactions. In addition, to 
further deepen financial inclusion, 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi 
inaugurated 75 Digital Banking Units 
(DBUs) across 75 districts. These units 
will provide comprehensive services 
related to savings, credit, investment, 
and insurance. The RBI has created 
guidelines on the role of DBUs, and 
these units will provide end-to-end 
digital processing of small ticket retail 
and MSME loans, starting from online 
applications to disbursals. 
UPI Lite facilitates low-value 
transactions in offline mode through 
on-device wallets, enabling users to 
make transactions even when they 
do not have access to the internet. In 
November 2022, the RBI launched a 
pilot project on Central Bank Digital 
Currency (CBDC), with a use case for 
the wholesale digital rupee. This was 
used for the settlement of secondary 
market transactions in Government 
securities, which could reduce 
transaction costs.
Furthermore, the RBI has launched 
a pilot project to digitise Kisan Credit 
Card (KCC) lending, which aims to 
improve efficiency, cost savings, 
and reduce turnaround time. The 
digitisation of KCC lending is expected 
to transform the flow of credit in the 
rural economy, making it easier and 
faster for farmers to access credit, 
which can support their farming 
activities and boost their income.
The Bank is actively embracing 
the new wave of technology 
and innovation promoted by the 
Government, positioning us at 
the forefront of new-age Digital 
Banking by making it simpler, 
faster, and more convenient. 
We are leveraging cuttingedge technology to pioneer 
innovative solutions within the 
industry. As a testament to our 
commitment, we have launched 
several pioneering programmes 
such as our Cattle Finance App, 
a one-touch solution designed 
to empower dairy farmers by 
providing them with an end-toend digital processing platform. 
Additionally, we have introduced 
Digital Rupee (CBDC-R), a digital 
alternative to physical cash 
transactions, with a significant 
number of bank customers and 
merchants already utilizing this 
innovative solution across multiple 
cities. HDFC Bank's UPI has also 
demonstrated impressive yearon-year growth of 70% in both 
value and volumes, indicating 
a consistent upward trend. Our 
Offline Pay initiative is enabling 
digital transactions without 
the need for network and was 
successfully piloted in 19 cities 
across different tiers. We have also 
started with implementation of 
Generative AI and aim to harness 
its capabilities to streamline, 
automate as well as bring in agility 
to our operations. Digi-Passbook 
and Signature verification are some 
other initiatives undertaken.

and there is a global push to 
incorporate sustainability practices 
in business operations through ESG 
considerations. The financial services 
industry is expected to consider ESG 
and climate-related risks in decisionmaking. The Reserve Bank of India has 
also recognised the potential physical 
and transition risks arising from climate 
banking, digital payments, and lending, 
banks and financial institutions are 
faced with the need to have robust IT 
infrastructure with resilient systems 
and stringent policies. To mitigate 
the risks and safeguard customer 
interests, regulatory bodies are 
implementing safe practices and 
stringent policies. The RBI has 
been proactively taking steps to 
keep supervised entities abreast of 
new security challenges and cyber 
threats, including revising draft 
master directions on outsourcing of IT 
services. RBI has released updated 
change, which could have an impact 
on the sustainability and financial 
soundness of individual regulated 
entities and systemic financial stability. 
In July 2022, the Reserve Bank of 
India released a discussion paper 
IT governance and risk management 
frameworks for regulated entities 
for public comments. Continuous 
knowledge acquisition and staying 
ahead of the curve in cyber security 
measures will be crucial for financial 
institutions to maintain a secure digital 
environment for their customers.
on Climate Risk and Sustainable 
Finance, recommending regulated 
entities including Banks to incorporate 
climate-related and environmental 
risks in their business strategies, 
governance and risk management 
frameworks, and adopt a forwardlooking, comprehensive, and strategic 
approach to dealing with climaterelated risks. In April 2023, the RBI has 
also issued a framework for accepting 
green deposits by regulated entities.
HDFC Bank prioritises 
cybersecurity and privacy risks. It 
is implementing measures such 
as a next-generation Security 
Operations Centre, Security 
Orchestration, Automation & 
Response, and a zero-trust 
architecture. Our comprehensive 
information security programme, 
led by the CISO, ensures the 
confidentiality, integrity, and 
availability of our infrastructure. 
Additionally, our Board of Directors 
provide oversight of the information 
security programme, ensuring 
that cyber security and privacy 
receive attention from the highest 
governing body of the Bank. Further, 
we understand the importance 
of privacy in the digital age and 
the responsibility we have in 
handling personal information. 
We have established a robust 
privacy governance framework 
which includes a designated Data 
Privacy Officer, cross-functional 
privacy champions, and a clear 
chain of responsibility for privacyrelated matters. We embrace the 
principles of Privacy by Design to 
embed privacy safeguards into our 
processes from the outset.

The changing world 
of work
Global workforce trends are shifting as 
many people rethink how and where 
they want to work. The fundamental 
shift in how people have been working 
post the COVID-19 pandemic has 
brought about significant changes 
in work dynamics. There is now a 
heightened focus on physical and 
mental well-being as well as hybrid and 
flexible work environment. With the 
growing demand for skilled talent in IT 
and digital technologies, there are also 
very high attrition levels witnessed in 
the IT segment and frontline staff. An 
exclusive HR trend analysis conducted 
by consulting firm Aon reveals a 
significant acceleration in attrition 
within the financial services segment. 
According to the analysis, the overall 
attrition rate in the banking sector was 
24.7% between January 2022 and 
September 2022. 
In addition, people now have the 
ability to work from anywhere in the 
world, making the talent landscape 
borderless and far more competitive. 
The world of work continues to 
evolve, impacted by an increasing 
battle for attracting and retaining skills 
and exacerbated by trends of 'great 
resignation' and flexible, hybrid work 
requirements.
We are actively investing in 
employee engagement and 
retention. We meet the evolving 
talent needs of the organisation 
by embracing digitisation and 
enhancing employee engagement. 
We are focusing on nurturing 
talent through insightful learning 
and development programmes, 
videos and e-learning modules. 
Additionally, we have significantly 
strengthened our talent acquisition 
efforts, hiring more than 85,000 
employees in FY23. We believe 
that the health and safety of our 
employees and their families 
are of utmost importance. Our 
flagship initiative, 'HDFC Bank 
Cares,' is designed to prioritise the 
well-being of our employees by 
providing resources and a platform 
for physical, mental, emotional, 
and financial wellness.

Our comprehensive risk management 
is overseen by our Board of Directors. 
They have established the Risk Policy 
& Monitoring Committee (RPMC) to 
ensure the effective implementation of 
our risk strategy. The RPMC plays a 
crucial role in guiding the development 
of policies, procedures, and systems, 
and continuously evaluates their 
suitability and relevance to the evolving 
business landscape and our risk 
tolerance.
Heading the independent Risk 
Management Group (RMG) is the Chief 
Risk Officer (CRO), who maintains 
regular communication with RPMC 
members. The RMG is primarily 
responsible for executing the risk 
strategy approved by the Board. 
This entails developing policies, 
procedures, and systems to identify, 
measure, monitor, assess, and 
manage risks effectively. We have 
institutionalised a senior management 
committee to oversee the integration 
which ensures that the risks emanating 

owing to the integration are measured 
and adequately addressed along with 
other integration related decisions. 
Risk frameworks and their 
implementation
The nature of our business and the 
regulatory and external environments 
expose us to various risks. Our primary 
risks include credit risk, market risk, 
liquidity risk, operational risk, cyber 
security, technology risk and data 
risk. Additionally, our operations entail 
compliance and reputation risks, 
as well as ESG risks. To address 
these risks, we have established an 
aggregate risk appetite framework. 
Furthermore, risk-specific policies, 
limits and triggers are implemented 
to operationalise the appetites for 
individual risk types. We have also 
taken comprehensive measures to 
ensure our preparedness in managing 
the risks associated with the merger.
We have a structured management 
framework called the Internal Capital 
Adequacy Assessment Process 
(ICAAP) to identify, assess, and 
manage all risks that could potentially 
have a significant negative impact on 
our business, financial position, or 
capital adequacy.
Regular capture and reporting of 
risk exposures occur, ensuring that 
the relevant management levels are 
informed, and appropriate mitigation 
measures are initiated. We also 
continuously evaluate the effectiveness 
of our existing risk models, including

assumptions and parameters, and 
refine them to adapt to changing 
circumstances.
To ensure independent evaluation, 
we maintain an Internal Audit 
Department responsible for assessing 
the adequacy and effectiveness of all 
internal controls, risk management 
practices, governance systems, and 
processes.
To foster a strong culture of checks 
and balances and eliminate potential 
conflicts of interest, we have separated 
the Risk, Audit, and Compliance 
functions from the Business functions. 
This separation enables a dedicated 
focus on revenue generation, as well 
as risk management and control.
Key risk management 
initiatives
The Bank recognises the importance 
of stress testing as an integral risk 
management tool. In addition to 
standard stress scenarios, we conduct 
stress testing based on topical themes 
driven by geopolitical, macroeconomic, 
and sectoral trends. This approach 
allows us to focus on specific areas 
of our portfolio and serves as an early 
warning system for potential actions. 
We have conducted stress tests on 
various themes to evaluate the impact 
on our portfolio and identify impacted 
borrowers. Further various measures 
to mitigate global risks are taken as 
detailed below: 
• Banking sector instability in the US: 
Over the past year, our bank has 
taken significant steps to safeguard 
from potential global banking crises. 
We have implemented a rigorous 
credit risk assessment process that 
involves thorough due diligence 
and ongoing monitoring of our loan 
portfolio. This has helped us identify 
and address potential credit risks in a 
timely manner, reducing our exposure 
to such events.
• Tighter monetary policy resulting 
in an extended period of elevated 
interest rates: Our bank has 
implemented several measures to 
manage the risks associated with 
rising interest rates throughout the 
year. This includes implementing 
robust risk management practices, 
diversifying our asset portfolio, and 
maintaining a strong capital and 
liquidity position. The bank closely 
monitors interest rate movements 
and takes proactive measures to 
mitigate and withstand any potential 
shocks.
• Growing tensions between China 
and Taiwan: As part of our risk 
management strategy, we have 
broadly assessed the impact of 
ongoing conflict between China and 
Taiwan. Although the direct impact of 
the conflict is unlikely to be material 
for the Bank, we are keeping a close 
watch on the situation. 
• De-dollarisation: Recently, there 
has been a growing trend among 
nations and market participants to 
reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar 
and explore alternative currencies 
or payment systems. The bank 
is closely monitoring the ongoing 
geopolitical events and shift in global 
trade patterns.
We are also increasing our focus 
on non-financial risks by elevating 
discussions of these risks in our Risk 
Management and Board committees. 
This includes operational risk, 
technology risk, reputation risk, and 
more. We are enhancing our policies, 
procedures, and risk assessment 
frameworks to effectively manage 
these risks, and this process of 
improvement will be ongoing.
We are leveraging technology to 
automate our risk management 
processes. This enables us to bring 
in efficiencies, improve accuracy, 
enhance user control, and maintain 
thorough audit trails. By embracing 
technological advancements, we aim 
to strengthen our risk management 
capabilities. The inherent risk in 
technology is also recognised, and 
risks emanating from the new age 
solutions based on AI/ML techniques 
are being comprehensively assessed 
through the lenses of Data Privacy, 
Data Security, Data Quality, Model 
fairness and efficacy, etc. 

A well-defined Board approved 
Market Risk Policy, Investment 
Policy, Foreign Exchange Trading 
Policy and Derivatives Policy along 
with robust control activities caps 
the risk at trading desk level and 
also at securities level through 
trading risk limits in line with the 
Bank’s risk appetite.
Portfolio-level evaluation and 
risk mitigation measures are also 
implemented.

to prevent, detect and react to 
the introduction of malicious code 
through sources such as computer 
viruses, worms, and trojans. We use a 
combination of commercially available 
proprietary tools and monitoring 
systems to mitigate the risks 
associated with malware. The antivirus 
signatures are updated more than 
once per day to stay current and cover 
workstations, servers, email gateways 
and web gateways.

Network security
The Bank uses a combination of 
firewalls and proxy servers to separate 
and control traffic between networks 
with different security requirements 
and levels of trust. The Bank has 
intrusion detection/prevention 
capabilities (IDS/ IPS) in place to detect 
and react to known attacks in real 
time. IDS/IPS signatures are updated 
periodically to update detection for 
specific threats, intruder profiles 
and attack patterns. These tools are 
configured to generate alerts when 
predefined thresholds are exceeded.
Vulnerability management
The Bank administrates a vulnerability 
management process that actively 
scans for security threats. The 
vulnerability management team is 
responsible for tracking and following 
up on vulnerability closures. Once a 
vulnerability requiring remediation has 
been identified, it is logged, prioritised 
according to severity, and assigned an 
owner. The vulnerability management 
team tracks such issues and follows 
up frequently until they can verify that 
the issues have been remediated.
Patch management
The Bank has patch management 
processes and tools to assess 
and deploy operating system and 
application specific patches and 
updates. This process includes steps 
to evaluate vendor supplied patches to 
determine servers that require patches 
and updates to document procedures 
for patching and updating servers, 
and to deploy patches and updates in 
a timely manner to protect the Bank’s 
infrastructure.
Penetration testing
To test potentially exploitable 
vulnerabilities, penetration tests are 
conducted for all critical networks 
and systems within the Bank’s 
internal environment and for external 
applications. Penetration tests are 
triggered based on several events, 
including new releases, updates, 
or enhancements. The types of 
penetration tests that are conducted 
include Network/Host Penetration 
Testing and Application Penetration 
Testing.
Logging and monitoring
The Bank has a logging and monitoring 
procedure in place to deal with 
network intrusions and incidents. User 
actions, system activity and changes 
to the infrastructure are logged. Logs 
are stored securely and are protected 
against modification, deletion, and 
inappropriate access. The relative 
risk level of the asset and alerts are 
generated in the event of audit log 
failures. Monitoring tools aggregate 
the log files and suspicious activity 
events are automatically reported to 
the Security Operations Centre (SOC) 
team. The SOC team performs the 
following steps:
• Analysis and Incident Detection – 
The SOC team collects information 
from the system generated event as 
well as other information sources to 
identify a potential incident.
• Event Tracking and Escalation – 
Events are assessed based on the 
level of risk and escalated based 
on guidance from the Incident 
Management policy; escalations 
include referral to the Cyber Incident 
Response Team (CIRT) for indepth analysis and forensics and 
management for situation awareness.
• Reporting – The CSOC team 
periodically reports on events and 
incidents to management.
Minimised surface area for cyberattacks
The Bank has a dedicated program 
for attack surface management that 
includes continuous attack surface 
discovery and hunting for weaknesses 
on the discovered assets. There has 
been a continuous effort to ensure 
that all significant weaknesses are 
remediated within a reasonable 
timeframe.
We have made significant 
advancements to further consolidate 
cyber security through initiatives 
such as the foundation of a next-gen 
Security Operations Center (SOC) 
for predictive security and incident 
management, introduction of Security 
Orchestration, Automation & Response 
(SOAR) to reduce incident response 
times, network micro-segmentation 
for better control, visibility and 
preparedness against ransomware, 
and round-the-clock defacement 
monitoring and vulnerability 
management of our internet properties.
The Bank has upgraded its monitoring 
and detection systems by deploying 
next generation security incident event 
management (SIEM) solution fuelled by 
artificial intelligence (AI) and machine 
learning (ML) capabilities along with 
strong UEBA (User Entity Behavioural 
Analysis) functionalities and inbuilt 
threat modelling. This initiative and 
approach to leverage AI and ML as an 
entire suite to proactively detect and 
respond to threats is an industry first.

Statutory Reports and 
Financial Statements

Changing regulations, customer 
preferences, and their material 
impact on financial performance 
are driving incorporation of 
ESG as a key factor in decisionmaking for organisations and 
investors alike. The Banking 
sector, being the custodian of the 
world's economies, will play a 
central role in ESG development 
and holds the key to systemic 
transformation required to achieve 
net-zero emissions. Already, 
lending decisions at Banks are 
becoming responsive to the ESG 
criteria. Additionally, Banks are 
incorporating ESG considerations 
into their risk management 
practices, including climate 
scenario analysis and climaterelated stress testing. Financial 
products with ESG element, such 
as green bonds, social bonds, etc. 
are being curated to satisfy the 
increasing demand for sustainable 
investment options. 
ESG Strategy Encompassing Sustainable Finance
Driving positive impact 
As per a recent report by the World 
Bank, green bonds have raised USD 
2.5 trillion globally until January 2023. 
During the same month, India launched 
the first green bond to raise about USD 
2 billion for projects that contribute to 
climate change mitigation, adaptation, 
environmental protection, resource and 
biodiversity conservation, and netzero objectives. As per a study by the 
International Energy Agency, as quoted 
in the Reserve Bank of India’s Report 
on Currency and Finance, 2022-2023, 
to reach net-zero emissions by 2070, 
India would need USD 160 billion 
per year on average between now 
and 2030. The evident financing gap 
presents a compelling case for India’s 
financial sector to gear up its efforts 
in mobilising substantial funds and 
implementing sustainable financing 
solutions to support the country's 
ambitious decarbonisation goals.
While the RBI had been taking 
incremental actions towards aligning 
Banks and their lending decisions 
towards sustainable development for 
over a decade, it has demonstrated 
a distinct focus on climate-related 
issues in the past year. In July 
2022, the RBI released its seminal 
“Discussion Paper on Climate Risk 
and Sustainable Finance” providing 
broad guidance. In January 2023, the 
RBI issued sovereign green bonds to 
mobilise resources for the Government 
for green infrastructural investments. 
In April 2023, the framework for 
mobilising green deposits by regulated 
entities has been released by the RBI 
with a view to fostering and developing 
green finance ecosystem in the 
country. In May 2023, its ‘Report on 
Currency and Finance’ uncovered 
the possible implications of climate 
change for the Indian economy and 
in preparing for the future – including 
climate stress tests to assess the 
banking sector’s vulnerability to climate 
risks. It is also expected to introduce 
a disclosure framework on climaterelated financial risks, along with 
guidance on climate scenario analysis 
and stress testing in the near future. 
The Securities and Exchange Board 
of India (SEBI) is also accelerating 
for the ESG transition in India. 
Moving forward from mandating ESG 
disclosures on quantifiable metrics 
for the nine principles of National 
Guidelines on Responsible Business 
Conduct for top 1000 companies in 
India FY23 onwards, it has now also 
announced mandatory assurance of 
select ESG disclosures for the top 
150 companies starting in FY24 which 
shall be gradually extended to the top 
1000 listed entities by FY27. It has also 
provisioned for ESG ratings based on 
these assured disclosures. 
The evolving landscape

Our ESG strategy
The evolving landscape of ESG 
integration in the Banking sector 
therefore necessitates a holistic 
approach that encompasses ESG 
aligned decision-making not only for 
our internal operational practices, 
but also extending beyond onto 
our external financing activities. In 
context of the latter, we are building 
our systems to navigate challenges 
and anticipate disruptions that may 
manifest through this evolution in the 
coming decade. This makes it crucial 
for us to embrace transformation in 
operations and innovation in product 
development to drive the transition 
towards a more resilient, socially 
responsible and environmentally 
conscious economy. The demand 
for new solutions that catalyse and 
accelerate the transition to a new 
economy presents an opportunity for 
us to play a role that is more impactful, 
and direct than ever before. The 
trinity of innovation, technology and 
partnerships offers a tremendous 
opportunity for us to create new 
markets, products, and business 
models that would help build financial 
strength. 
We are developing a comprehensive 
framework to support the integration 
of new ESG policies – including 
thorough evaluation of environmental, 
social and governance risks as a part 
of our overall credit appraisal and 
approval process, setting specific 
goals and targets for supporting 
sustainable financing initiatives, 
aligning with evolving ESG regulations 
and guidelines. Separately, we are also 
firming up an internal strategy around 
conducting climate risk assessments 
and tracking our financed emissions. 
We are also engaging with our 
corporate borrowers to understand 
their current ESG strategy and longterm climate transition plans, with 
a view to tailor our corporate loan 
portfolio towards climate-sensitive 
financing.
In terms of managing our internal 
operational practices, capturing ESG 
performance data remains one of our 
highest priorities and yet, a formidable 
challenge. The challenge is integral to 
distributed nature of our operations 
and is further convoluted with the 
volume of data and the variance in 
formats of data monitoring across 
our operations. We are continuously 
working towards bringing the relevant 
stakeholders together to communicate 
ESG requirements and revise existing 
data collection processes - where 
required to progressively enhance 
the completeness and accuracy 
of data. Our unrelenting efforts in 
this direction have enabled us to 
continuously further our transparency 
and disclosure practices. We continue 
to align our report with multiple 
frameworks - such as the GRI, IR, 
and SASB, and get the key ESG 
performance matrix externally assured. 
This year, we have progressed 
further and are disclosing the full 
suite of applicable BRSR disclosure 
requirements. We are also exploring 
data availability and methodologies for 
reporting on Task Force for Climate 
Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) 
and Task Force on Nature-related 
Financial Disclosures (TNFD). 
Two years ago, we strategically 
pledged to become carbon neutral by 
FY32. Over these two years, we have 
worked extensively to formulate and 
implement a framework that will keep 
us on the path towards this goal, while 
we continue to expand our operations. 
We continue to invest in a broad 
range of technological solutions and 
operational measures to reduce energy 
consumption at our operating locations 
including renewable energy and energy 
efficiency projects to lower our carbon 
footprint. Our pursuit of digitalisation, 
IT, IoT on one hand and ESG on the 
other hand has highlighted several 
areas of simultaneous progress; 
and we shall continue to leverage 
such opportunities by investing in IT 
capabilities and IT-enabled solutions. 
Upgradation of our data architecture 
will continue to complement evolution 
of our data governance practices and 
data collection strategy.
Underpinning all our ESG efforts is 
our resolve to manage expectations 
and respond to concerns of our 
stakeholders. Our people practices 
are based on principles of respect 
for human rights, employee wellbeing, inclusivity, fairness, and 
continuous improvement. For our 
customers, we strive to build longterm relationships based on trust, 
proving seamless service management 
journeys, offering a responsible suite 
of financial products and services, 
and safeguarding the confidentiality 
and protection of their information. 
Our curated community development 
initiatives aim to foster resilience, 
contribute to nation-building, and 
empower local communities through 
collaborative partnerships and targeted 
programs. By enforcing responsible 
vendor management practices, 
we ensure the sustainability values 
resonate with our suppliers and 
partners.

ESG Strategy encompassing Sustainable Finance
Sustainable finance
Sustainable finance is an organic 
continuum of our ESG strategy. The 
ESG strategy has set the foundation 
for the Bank to channel its resources 
towards sustainable projects. With 
ESG gaining momentum as a key 
factor in business decision making, the 
Bank is leveraging sustainable finance 
as one of its key ESG strategies in 
the form of enhanced environmental 
and social due diligence in lending 
and investment decisions thematic 
investing, ESG engagement and 
sustainable finance frameworks. 
Directing capital towards sustainable 
projects allows us to integrate ESG as 
the fundamental determinant in our 
core lending strategy, and generate a 
positive impact through our business 
model.
Being one of the key players in the 
banking industry, we recognize our 
role in facilitating the transition to a 
low-carbon economy. With our panIndia presence and strong customer 
relationships, we aim to drive positive 
change by promoting environmentally 
friendly technologies and financing 
sustainable infrastructure projects. 
We actively support the financing 
and investment in environmentallyfriendly technologies and low-carbon 
infrastructure projects, leveraging 
our product offerings and financial 
expertise to assist our customers and 
clients in transitioning to a sustainable, 
low-carbon economy.
The Bank has identified its products 
as one of the foremost business 
focus areas wherein ESG risks, and 
opportunities will be considered 
for improvement in systems and 
processes taking into account the 
expectations from various stakeholders 
including investors and regulators. 
The Bank is pursuing this through 
three thematic areas including ESG 
integration in products, sustainable 
finance and portfolio emissions. As the 
next step, long-term targets to strive to 
contribute to a more sustainable future 
are being set.
ESG integration in products
We have adopted a four-dimensional 
approach for steadily incorporating 
ESG factors into the design, 
development, and management of our 
products. 
ESG & Climate Change 
Assessment framework: 
In FY23, the Bank adopted an 
enhanced and more comprehensive 
Our approach
Our ESG strategy encompasses 
people, customers, lending, and 
governance for long-term value 
creation for all stakeholders. 
Effective corporate governance 
acts as a binding force that 
integrates and supports our 
organisational ESG efforts by 
providing formalised processes, 
and structures that guide our 
decision-making and accountability 
to ensure successful integration 
of both internal and external ESG 
initiatives within the organisation. 
Our ESG initiatives are overseen 
by the CSR & ESG Committee 
of the Board. A separate ESG 
apex council at the management 
level, chaired by the Group Head for 
ESG & CSR and comprising senior 
members from various functions, 
reports to the CSR & ESG Committee 
and provides regular updates to 
the Board for annual review. This 
Committee is further supported by 
ESG Working Groups including the 
Environment Working Group which 
oversees the environmental impact 
from our operations; the Social and 
Governance Working Group which 
works on workplace policies and 
governance initiatives; and the Product 
Responsibility Working Group which 
looks at ESG risks (including climate 
risks) in the existing portfolio and ESGlinked opportunities.
We are in the process of setting out 
specific and measurable targets 
aligned with our business operations 
and portfolio to track and evaluate 
our progress, and report on the same 
to the CSR and ESG Committee 
of the Board through thorough 
consultation with ESG Council and 
Working Groups. We also intend to 
accelerate the scale and pace of 
delivering value by using collaboration 
as a mechanism to effectively foster 
strategic partnerships with solution 
providers, civil societies, government 
agencies that would help us bring 
together capabilities and resources to 
achieve our ESG objectives.

Additional diligence for large 
project financing transactions
For specialised, long-term project 
financing, in addition to the above 
assessment which is carried out at 
borrower level in all CAMs, Lenders’ 
Independent Engineer (LIE) assesses 
various environmental and social 
issues related to the transaction 
and the various identified risks and 
suggested mitigation measures 
are captured in a LIE Report. As 
a pre-disbursement compliance, 
implementation of the necessary 
mitigation measures is required and 
are also monitored on an ongoing 
basis during the implementation 
phase of the project and corrective 
action is taken in case of any adverse 
developments. 
Client engagement 
As the largest private sector Indian 
Bank, our role is to create awareness 
amongst our borrowers, thereby 
encouraging them to measure and 
disclose their footprint. This would 
eventually reflect in our Scope 3 
emissions and help us move towards 
a net-zero portfolio commitment. 
We understand that there are 
opportunities in transitioning to a netzero economy, but the ecosystem (in 
the country) needs to be developed 
to take up such opportunities. The 
Bank has been engaging with its large 
corporate customers specifically those 
with businesses in “hard to abate” 
industries such as Oil & Gas, cement, 
steel, power, auto, and mining. The 
purpose of these engagements is to 
identify current ESG & Climate change 
related focus areas/practices and to 
identify best practices and emerging 
initiatives being taken by industry 
players on ESG and climate risk related 
issues including, but not limited to:
• Short term emission reduction 
targets and long-term net-zero goals
• Practices with respect to hazardous/
polluting waste management
• ESG & climate related disclosures
• Supply chain decarbonisation
• Policies and practices with respect to 
gender diversity/inclusion
The Bank has been sharing such best 
practices in wider client engagements 
with other borrowers in the same 
segments. ESG compliance and the 
impact of climate change has also 
become one of the areas of discussion 
in our regular customer calls/meetings 
with the Customers. The discussions 
are expected to continue to take place 
with different borrowers and best 
practices/learnings from the same 
would be documented. 
Inclusion of terms & conditions 
related to ESG compliance in 
facility documentation
As part of the Bank’s standard 
facility documentation, an addendum 
schedule has now been included 
which comprises representations/
warranties/covenants agreed to, by 
the borrower on various ESG related 
issues. This schedule is included in all 
standard sanction letters
Sustainable Finance 
Framework
It is our endeavour to enhance our 
portfolio from a climate and ESG 
perspective. The Bank is in the 
process of developing a “Sustainable 
Financing Criteria” Framework (“the 
Framework”) with the objective of 
identifying facilities in its credit portfolio 
where financing has been provided 
to borrowers in identified industries, 
qualifying as “sustainable lending”. 
Credit facilities granted towards such 
end uses in the specified industries 
shall be classified as either “green” 
or “social” facilities. The Bank is 
developing the Framework with the 
objective of assessing and ultimately 
enhancing its commitment towards 
sustainable lending in various industry 
segments.
The Framework is being developed 
using Bond Principles (developed 
by the International Capital Markets 
Association - ICMA) and Loan 
Principles (developed by the Loan 
Market Association - LMA) as the basis 
for identification of “sustainable finance 
segments”. Some of the key industry 
segments which have been identified 
thus far as “sustainable segments” 
include:
• Renewable energy – Solar and Wind 
power generation
• Hydroelectric power generation
• Agriculture and Allied Businesses
• Biomass and other non-conventional 
energy sources
• Sustainable/affordable Infrastructure
• Impact NBFCs

ESG Strategy encompassing Sustainable Finance

The Bank is in the process of obtaining 
a third-party certification of the 
methodology behind the framework 
and the framework itself. Once this is 
in place, suitable disclosures would 
be made in the public domain. Our 
plan to monitor our sustainable finance 
portfolio will enable us to identify and 
utilise climate transition value creation 
opportunities. 
Our financed renewable energy (solar 
and wind) capacity has more than 
doubled in the past 3 years, and we 
anticipate financing to renewables as 
well as other green projects to further 
accelerate in the coming years. So 
far, we have underwritten loans of 
C15,115 Crore for a cumulative capacity 
of 6,110 MW. Also, with increased 
focus on energy transition projects we 
sanctioned credit limits of C160 Crore 
towards deployment of electric buses.
Managing our portfolio 
emissions 
As a progressive financial 
service company, we embrace 
our responsibility to incorporate 
environmental considerations into our 
investment decisions. Through our 
investments, we look forward to driving 
the transition towards a sustainable, 
low-carbon economy while mitigating 
the risk of stranded investments. 
This includes firming up a strategy to 
integrate environmental risks, including 
those stemming from climate change, 
into our underwriting and portfolio 
screening processes in the long term. 
Our lending procedures are guided 
by borrower and market demand, but 
our credit exposure is well-diversified, 
with no single industry having a high 
concentration. As a result, our credit 
exposure to ecologically/socially 
sensitive industry sectors has minimal 
negative consequences.
Disclosure of our own portfolio 
emissions remains dependent upon 
emission data disclosures from our 
borrowers. Although, we acknowledge 
the challenges involved, we remain 
steadfast to working with our 
borrowers to build their capacity for 
the same. Simultaneously, despite the 
foreseeable challenges, we also intend 
to use our influence to encourage our 
borrowers to commit to net-zero.
Less than 1% of the total 
exposure comes from fossil 
fuels (coal and lignite) and their 
extraction/mining.
The Bank has successfully 
underwritten project term loan facility 
amounting to C2,143 Crore for financing 
development of City Gas Distribution 
(CGD) network being implemented 
by Torrent Gas Jaipur Private Limited. 
Jaipur CGD network consists of 132 
CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) 
stations, 5.28 Lakh household PNG 
(Piped Natural Gas) connections 
and 8,423 inch-km of natural gas 
pipelines. CGD financing aids the 
energy transitions towards greener fuel 
reducing the country’s oil dependence 
and supports Governments’ initiatives 
to make the country a Gas economy.
The Bank is the advisor for 
Mahanagar Gas Limited for 
acquisition of Unison Enviro 
Private Limited a (subsidiary of 
Ashoka Buildcon Limited), which is 
developing CGD network in three 
geographical areas. Also, the Bank 
is the lead arranger for raising funds 
from public through IPO listing for 
IRM Energy Private Limited.
In alternative fuel space, the Bank 
is evaluating multiple proposals 
for financing projects involved in 
production of Compressed Biogas 
(CBG) projects and Ethanol which 
reduces the carbon emissions 
substituting the conventional fuels 
like oil & gas.

Our Energy Performance
Being in the service sector, energy 
is one of the main resources that we 
consume to run our operations. We 
use electricity to power our operating 
locations - including our data centres 
and fossil fuel in the form of diesel, 
petrol and CNG to power diesel-based 
generators and company-owned cars.
In FY23, we consumed 1.98 Million GJ 
of energy - which is a slight increase 
on account of the increased number 
of operating locations over last year. 
Electrical energy accounts for over 
79% of our energy consumption. Most 
of our energy consumption is in the 
form of electricity (1.57 Million GJ), 
and most of it is procured from the 
grid although we continue to look out 
for sources of renewable energy to 
replace grid energy, wherever feasible.
Our focus is on aligning our 
business operations with socially 
and environmentally responsible 
practices. This involves integrating 
technological advancements and 
process improvements into our 
daily operations to contribute 
to the overall improvement of 
the environmental quality and 
creating value.
In FY23, our energy intensity stood 
at 11.40 GJ/FTE and 10.24 GJ/INR 
Crore income. Compared to FY22, 
our energy intensity increased slightly 
in the reporting year, on account of 
full-scale office-based operations in 
FY23 as compared to a significant 
proportion of our workforce working 
from home during FY22 due to 
COVID-19 induced restrictions.
In our efforts to gradually reduce our 
carbon footprint, we are progressively 
integrating renewable energy sources 
into our overall power consumption. 
We will install solar panels in our 
upcoming offices wherever possible. 
We have rooftop solar plants at 10 
locations across the country. Our total 
capacity as of March 31, 2023 was 
282.5 kWp. 
In the state of Maharashtra, 12 of our 
offices and branches have transitioned 
to green power sourced at a premium 
tariff through DISCOMs. With the 
procurement of over 2,533.8 MWh 
during FY23, about 1,799 metric 
tonnes of carbon emissions were 
avoided during the year. 
We are also currently exploring open 
access for large office premises. 
Despite a growing market for openaccess procurement of renewable 
energy, and the introduction of 
progressive rules like "Promoting 
Renewable Energy through Green 
Energy Open Access Rules, 2022, 
there remain a number of regulatory 
and market challenges for us to scale 
up our RE procurement. Several states 
are yet to adopt the Rules in the form 
of Regulations for implementation of 
Green Energy Open Access (GEOA) 
at the state level, hindering the pace 
of adoption of open access RE 
across our locations. We consider 
it crucial to eliminate these external 
challenges to enable at-scale adoption 
of green power across our distributed 
consumption centres.

Apart from electricity sourced through 
the grid, through open access or 
from our captive sources, some of 
our locations also generate electricity 
using diesel generators for backup 
purposes. For our approach to 
calculation of emissions and energy 
consumption please refer to the notes 
at the end of table on summary of 
emissions.
In FY23, 11% of our energy

Building Management and 
Green Buildings:
To support our decarbonization efforts, 
we are actively engaged in reducing 
energy consumption across all aspects 
of our operations. This objective 
is achieved through a multifaceted 
approach, including the regulation 
of existing equipment, installation 
of energy-efficient alternatives, and 
the implementation of automated 
energy management solutions. Our 
comprehensive energy management 
and efficiency strategy encompasses 
various initiatives, reflecting our 
commitment to sustainable practices 
and mitigating climate change.
By leveraging digital systems and 
data analytics, we gain valuable 
insights into energy consumption 
patterns. Our focus extends to 
maintaining branches at optimal 
temperatures, improving power 
efficiency, and automating 
energy-consuming assets. 
These initiatives enable us to 
optimize energy usage, enhance 
operational efficiency, and reduce 
our environmental footprint.
In FY23, the Bank accounted for 
electricity consumption from four of its 
co-located data centers in addition to 
an owned data center that was closed 
during the reporting year. We are also 
implementing measures to increase 
the energy efficiency of our data 
centres which also leads to operational 
efficiency enhancement. 
Environment

We have incorporated several changes 
within our infrastructure to improve 
energy efficiency through auto controls 
and environment-friendly equipment 
and have installed centrally controlled 
energy management system in about 
600 branches across India till date. 
This system has allowed us to control 
consumption patterns, resulting in 
savings to the tune of 17% annually on 
an average.
We are using technology and 
innovation as facilitators in our journey 
towards low-carbon growth. We have 
implemented elevator and equipment 
scheduling to reduce our energy 
consumption. We have also installed 
occupancy sensors, capacitor banks 
as well as Building Management 
Systems at several of our operating 
locations. The energy management 
modules with auto controls deployed 
across select branches have resulted 
in significant energy savings. We also 
have piloted use of modular UPS 
in our branches and plan to scale 
further. Additionally, all ACs in our new 
premises will conform to the latest BEE 
standards.

Environment
Moving beyond just our energy 
consumption, we have taken it upon 
ourselves to implement other green 
measures including waste and water 
management in our existing and new 
fit-outs. We intend to adopt a more 
holistic approach towards reducing 
our environmental footprint at our 
operating locations.
We have registered 1,990 projects 
(offices & branches) with Indian 
Green Building Council (IGBC) for 
certification. Of these, 947 projects 
in different cities are certified under 
the Green Interiors Rating System of 
IGBC as of March 31, 2023. All our 
upcoming branches will be evaluated 
for green certification. Additionally, 
some of our offices are also LEED 
certified. IGBC's comprehensive rating 
modules encompassing Eco Design 
Approach, Interior Materials, Water 
Conservation, Indoor Environment, 
Energy Efficiency, and Innovation in 
Interior Design have been diligently 
implemented and met with excellence 
throughout our certified branches and 
offices. We prioritise environmental 
sustainability and have been using 
GreenPro certified materials such 
as plywood, laminates, flooring tiles, 
ceiling tiles, paints, adhesives, finishes, 
and equipment at our select locations. 
Additionally, we include low VOC 
finishes in our BOQ and contractor 
tendering process.
GHG emissions
We are dedicated to playing our part 
in addressing climate change and 
promoting sustainable practices 
not only within our operations but 
also throughout our value chain. 
Our emissions inventory includes 
emissions from our operations in India 
and includes our Corporate offices 
(301), Currency Chests (33), Training 
Centres & Guest Houses (26), Data 
Centres (5*), Branches (7,813, which 
excludes 4 overseas branches and 
DBUs) and ATMs (17,765 - Excluding 
CDMs), aligning to our reporting to 
regulatory authorities as of March 
31, 2023. Collecting complete and 
accurate activity data from tens of 
thousands of our distributed locations, 
of varying sizes & nature, is one of our 
key challenges, and hence a strategic 
priority action area. The dynamic 
nature of our branch operations, 
characterized by the simultaneous 
opening and closing of multiple 
branches during the annual reporting 
cycles further exacerbates the 
complexities in accurately determining 
and monitoring activity levels at 
our locations during the different 
timeframes across the reporting 
year. We are continuously enhancing 
our data collection processes and 
exploring suitable technological 
solutions to enhance stakeholder 
confidence on completeness of our 
inventory.
We are continuously implementing 
technical and management solutions 
to reduce our GHG footprint. Our 
efforts in this direction are guided by 
our commitment to become carbon 
neutral by FY32. We have rolled out an 
actionable strategy roadmap designed 
through an extensive bottomup consultative process to make 
incremental and measurable progress 
towards this goal.
In FY23, our Scope 1 emissions 
accounted for 8%, Scope 2# emissions 
accounted for 80%, and Scope 3 
emissions accounted for 12% of our 
total emissions. Out of the total 
Scope 1 emissions, fuel consumption 
in diesel generators was the primary 
contributor with a share of 55%, 
followed by fuel consumption in 
company-owned vehicles contributing 
to the remaining 45%.
Our Scope 2 emissions encompassed 
emissions associated with purchased 
electricity from the grid at locations 
which are owned or controlled by the 
Bank and are owned and co-located 
data centres. We are continuously 
taking measures to seek ways to 
reduce our scope 2 emissions - 
through interventions in our own 
operations and through collaboration 
with our data centre service providers. 
This year we have used both location 
based and market based approach to 
calculate our Scope 2 emissions.
Electricity consumption at our other 
facilities, along with emissions on 
account of air travel, car/cab travel, 
train travel, paper, and e-waste 
contribute to our Scope 3 emissions 
that cover categories 5 and 6 and 
8 as per the Technical Guidance for 
Calculating Scope 3 Emissions of the 
WRI GHG protocol. At present, the 
Bank only reports for category 5, 6 
and 8 for scope 3 emissions.

 Data Centers Other locations
Currently, data centres contribute 
5% of our Scope 2# emissions. We 
are continuously enhancing our data 
collection systems, processes, and 
governance mechanisms to improve 
accuracy of data collection for GHG 
inventorisation. Considering Scope 2# 
emissions are our primary source of 
GHG emissions, we have prioritised 
strengthening the mechanisms 
for collection of our electricity 
consumption data from various 
operating locations. In the first phase, 
we are targeting our high consumption 
locations, gradually moving on to other 
location categories.
Overall, during FY23, actual kWh 
data could be obtained for 52% of 
the locations which accounted for 
about 54% of the total electrical 
energy consumed. For the remaining 
locations, a hierarchical approach has 
been followed for estimating energy 
consumption. For locations with 
available electricity procurement costs, 
the same has been used along with 
state-level tariff to estimate electricity 
consumption. For other locations, 
electricity consumption was calculated 
using internally derived electricity 
consumption benchmarks specific to 
climatic zones. 
We have identified ATMs as one of the 
location categories where we need to 
significantly set up our efforts to collect 
actual energy consumption despite 
ATMs accounting for approximately 4% 
of the total energy consumption.
In FY23, our Scope 3 emissions 
increased over FY22. The emissions 
from purchased electricity at other 
facilities accounted for 67% of our total 
Scope 3 emissions. In comparison to 
FY22, the emissions from our other 
facilities have decreased by 3%. Apart 
from these facilities, hired cabs (14%), 
air travel (12%), paper waste (7%), rail 
travel (0.005%) and e-waste (0.005%) 
contributed to our Scope 3 emissions.

Notes:
Scope 1 emissions include CO2, N2O and 
CH4 emissions from the combustion of diesel 
purchased by the Bank for its owned DG sets, 
as well as the combustion of various fossil fuels 
in Bank-owned vehicles. 
1. For most of our locations (over 90%), the 
diesel consumption in DG sets is recorded 
in our financial database as the amount 
spent for diesel purchased and is converted 
into the quantity of diesel fuel consumed 
using estimations of diesel prices in different 
states. For the remaining 10% of locations, 
we have extrapolated based on estimates 
of diesel consumption at other locations 
serving as our internal benchmarks for 
diesel consumption.
The data for expenditure towards purchase 
of fossil fuels for consumption in companyowned vehicles is extracted from the Bank's 
financial management system and is used 
to derive fuel consumption in liters/kg using 
estimates of fossil fuel prices in various 
states. For remaining locations, the national 
average fuel price is used and average of 
CNG price in NCT is used to estimate CNG 
consumption.
3. At present, the refrigerants data is not 
included in the Scope 1 emissions as 
the bank is in the process of collating the 
refrigerant data.
The Bank has considered both location-based 
and market-based approach to calculate its 
Scope 2 emissions. Scope 2 emissions include 
GHG emissions from electricity consumed in 
the facilities that can be considered to be under 
the operational control of the Bank, as well 
as its co-located data centres. A hierarchical 
approach has been followed for the estimation 
of emissions from this category (i.e. (i) monitored 
data on electricity consumption, (ii) estimated 
electricity consumption based on location 
specific trends of electricity consumption for 
over six months, (iii) estimates of electricity 
consumed based on procurement costs and 
state-level tariff; and (iv) estimated electricity 
consumption based on climatic-zone specific, 
internally derived electricity consumption 
benchmarks; in that order). For location based 
approach, in all cases, the Grid emission factor 
from version 18 of the CEA’s (Central Electrical 
Authority) CO2 database has been used. While 
for market based approach, emission factor of 
0 has been considered against the electricity 
consumed/ procured from captive rooftop solar 
plants and green tariff
Scope 3 emission estimation: Emission on 
account of purchased electricity at our other 
locations (i.e. ATMs) has been estimated using 
the same approach as in Scope 2. Emissions 
from hired cabs have been estimated based 
on an e-expense report for hired cabs from 
the Bank’s financial management system – 
which has been used to derive the distance 
travelled. The average emission factor for 
various categories of cars from the India GHG 
Programme has been used. For domestic air, 
international air and rail travel, information on 
trip characteristics has been extracted from 
the Bank’s financial management system, and 
the distance travelled is derived from publicly 
available sources. The emission factors for 
domestic air travel have been taken from 
the India GHG programme. Whereas, the 
international air travel emission calculation has 
been done as per DEFRA Government emission 
conversion factors for greenhouse gas company 
reporting, Business travel-air (2022).
Emissions from paper waste and e-waste have 
been estimated based on emission factors for 
landfilling provided by the latest version of the 
USEPA’s WARM tool on the extracted data for 
paper waste and e-waste disposed.
During FY23, our Scope 1+2 GHG 
emissions intensity decreased by 11% 
and 11% y-o-y per FTE and per Crore 
income, respectively.

Measures to reduce GHG emissions
We remain committed to implementing meaningful and system-driven changes within the organisation to reduce 
the GHG intensity of our operations. We have adopted firm-level guidelines for operations and procurement for 
supply-side and demand-side interventions.
Environment
With our unwavering commitment towards environmental 
sustainability, we have set forth an ambitious target of 
achieving carbon neutrality by 2032. In our FY22 Integrated 
Report, we had also given out our trajectory for carbon 
neutrality with interim targets on energy and emissions KPIs. 
While our overarching target of achieving neutrality by FY32 
remains unchanged, we have re-aligned the interim targets 
based on increase in overall emission projections resulting 
from the addition of offices and branches from HDFC 
Limited, post the merger. We have mapped our performance 
against our target for FY23 in the figure below:

may not be immediately visible. During the reporting year, 
we kickstarted the implementation of our carbon-neutral 
strategy with actions across our demand side and supply 
side. Many of these measures were implemented in the later 
quarters of the reporting year. We are confident that these 
measures will manifest as substantial emission reductions in 
FY24 and beyond.

As a responsible bank, we recognise our impact on the environment beyond our core operations. While we diligently address 
emissions within our operating boundary, we also acknowledge the importance of taking measures outside our direct 
operations. We have thus, prioritised two key aspects that have a direct impact on reducing GHG emissions within our value 
chain: paper waste reduction and tree plantation.
Waste Management
We aim to work progressively towards 
sustainable management of waste 
generated from our operations. We 
are in the process of formalising 
a waste management policy that 
prioritises segregation and recycling, 
promotes environmental awareness 
and ensures safe handling and storage 
of waste. We assign clear roles and 
responsibilities, comply with legislative 
requirements, and aim to minimise 
waste generation.
While we have been continuously 
striving to reduce waste generation 
from our facilities, during the reporting 
year, we have taken a significant step 
forward by implementing an effective 
recycling program for several waste 
categories across several of our 
locations. This expansion reinforces 
our commitment to promoting the 
circular economy and minimizing our 
negative environmental footprint.

Reducing GHG 
emissions across 
our value chain
Where paper use is unavoidable, we are 
switching to recycled paper. As a result, 
associated emissions increased by less than 
20% y-o-y in FY23, despite a 13% increase in 
our customer base.
Our digital products and services, along 
with automation of several internal as well as 
customer-linked processes and channels, 
have enabled us to reduce paper waste 
generation. The ‘Green Event Guidelines’ 
rolled out by our retail marketing team has 
helped save about 33.10 Lakh Sq. ft. of paper 
during the reporting year.
Our digitised processes and products 
have helped customers reduce their 
frequency of visits to the Bank’s 
branches, ATMs, and offices - thereby 
reducing associated emissions.
We have launched an ambitious tree plantation 
initiative and have successfully planted over 30 
Lakh trees to date. This program has not only 
resulted in significant reductions in our GHG 
emissions but has also served as a catalyst for 
enhancing our social and relationship capital.

We deal with five types of nonhazardous wastes: e-waste, paper 
waste, food waste, plastic waste, 
and other non-hazardous waste. We 
recognise our responsibility in ensuring 
that all these wastes are disposed 
responsibly. For dry waste, we have 
implemented waste segregation and 
recycling in 16 offices. All the dry waste 
from these offices is collected and 
disposed through authorised vendors 
who eventually recycle the waste. 
In FY23, disposal of our owned IT 
assets led to the generation of 87.82 
tonnes of e-waste and batteries 
in addition to 0.33 tonnes of other 
e-waste and batteries from our non-IT 
operations at select locations. We 
ensure that our e-waste and batteries 
are disposed through authorised 
recyclers. 
88.15 tonnes 
of e-waste generated and 
recycled in FY23
293.89 tonnes 
Total waste recycled in FY23
Through internal consultations and 
partnerships with our vendors, we will 
be expanding the coverage of facilities 
at which we track our dry waste 
(including e-waste) progressively and 
scale it up over the next few years. At 
some of our locations, waste diesel oil 
is produced due to the operation of DG 
sets which is classified as hazardous 
waste and disposed using approved, 
authorised vendors. 
Water Conservation
Due to the value of water as a precious 
resource, we use water judiciously. 
Our water consumption is restricted to 
consumption for domestic purposes 
and drinking. At our most locations, we 
obtain water from municipal or thirdparty suppliers. We are committed to 
reducing water consumption and to 
accurately measuring and monitoring 
it. As part of this commitment, we have 
planned installation of IoT-based water 
meters at some of our locations. In the 
coming years, we will be expanding 
this coverage in a phased manner.
By incorporating water-saving 
practices, and technologies, we are

actively working towards a more 
sustainable future and playing our part 
in addressing global water challenges. 
In our IGBC certified branches, 
all washrooms are equipped with 
low-flow flush & low-flow fixtures; 
the urinals are sensor-based with a 
flow rate of 1 to 1.5 Low-Pass Filter 
(LPF). Through such measures, most 
of our green branches are able to 
achieve 27-30% water savings over 
the UPC(I) baselines. Estimated water 
consumption at an operational level 
with respect to our total employee 
strength for FY23 is about 2,167 Million 
Litres.
We do not generate industrial 
wastewater. However, for the sewage 
that is produced, we have taken 
proactive steps by installing sewage 
treatment plants at some of our larger 
office premises.
Besides our operation, we also have 
an impact outside our operational 
boundaries by working with 
communities to conserve water and to 
rejuvenate water bodies. The details 
of this can be found in our ‘SocialCommunities’ chapter.

TCFD disclosures
HDFC Bank recognises the growing 
concerns of regulators, investors, 
and clients about climate risks that 
businesses, particularly banks and 
financial institutions, face. This is 
our third year of working on the 
recommendations of the Task Force on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD) - which provides a useful 
framework for identifying climaterelated risks and opportunities, 
evaluating effective responses, and 
communicating crucial information to 
stakeholders.
Governance
The Bank has a Board approved and 
governed ESG policy framework and 
Environmental Policy that identifies 
the Bank's environmental risks 
and impacts including those from 
Climate Change. The CSR & ESG 
Environment

Committee of the Board oversees 
the Bank’s sustainability and climate 
change initiatives. This committee 
oversees and monitors the ESG 
framework, the Environmental policy, 
actionables and initiatives strategised 
and executed by the management 
level ESG Apex Council and the ESG 
working groups. The committee also 
oversees and monitors the Bank’s ESG 
disclosures, highlighting the Bank’s 
ESG performance and prioritisation 
of material topics. The ESG Apex 
Council is a senior management level 
council that governs and reviews the 
progress of the three ESG working 
groups that drive the ESG agenda 
(including climate change) at the Bank. 
This committee shapes and guides the 
ESG strategy of the Bank. Updates on 
actionable arising from this committee 
are further reported to the CSR & 
ESG committee of the Board. The 
ESG working groups reports to the 
ESG Apex Council and is responsible 
for driving the Bank’s ESG strategy 
and roadmap to achieve set targets, 
including those of climate change. 
There are three working groups for 
better focus and monitoring: the 
Environment working group, the Social 
& Governance working group and 
the Product Responsibility working 
group. The Environment working 
group sets targets and identifies 
opportunities for improvement in 
areas of emissions, energy, water, and 
waste. The Product Responsibility 
group, examines Environmental & 
Social (E&S) risks in our portfolio and 
lending, including climate risks, while 
finding new business opportunities in 
the E&S arena. It is also responsible 
and accountable for formalisation 
of sustainable finance framework 
and processes to identify ESG risks 
in lending, engagement with clients 
on ESG including climate change 
and the action taken on TCFD 
recommendations including stress 
testing. Climate change initiatives are 
updated to the CSR & ESG committee 
of the Board that meets every quarter. 
The Bank has a dedicated ESG vertical 
that works in conjunction with several 
internal and external stakeholders, 
to drive the ESG agenda including 
managing, mitigating, and reporting 
on climate metrics. The Group Head 
(CSR & ESG) reports to the Board 
every quarter, chairs the ESG apex 
council which drives the ESG & climate 
change strategy via the three working 
groups. The management level ESG 
council and working groups and 
hence the CSR & ESG committee of 
the Board reviews plans of action, 
targets, current performance against 
targets, initiatives undertaken by 
internal business units and employees 
to mitigate effects of climate change 
etc. The Board Committee also helps 
in setting and reviewing performance 
objectives thereby prescribing annual 
budgets for the same. The Bank’s 
risk team headed by the Chief Risk 
Officer spearheads the assessment 
and climate risk linked analysis of 
the Bank's portfolio. Credit officers 
assess overall E&S risks, especially 
climate risks through a comprehensive 
“ESG & Climate Change Assessment” 
framework, as a part of the overall 
credit assessment for its wholesale 
corporate borrowers.
Strategy
The Bank has been reporting to the 
Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) 
on its climate change strategy, 
risks, opportunities, and emissions. 
From the perspective of climate risk 
assessment, we will assess the priority 
of physical and transition risks in the 
near to medium term. Some of the 
critical parameters to consider would 
be GHG emissions, air pollutants and 
climate transition risk pathways both 
at the sector and borrower level. There 
are two main types of climate related 
risks:
Physical risks (both acute and 
chronic): Economic losses 
(physical damage to property and 
assets) from extreme weather 
events (flood, cyclone, etc.) 
attributed to climate change
Transition risks: Possible process 
of adjustment to a low carbon 
economy and its effects on the 
value of financial assets and 
liabilities.
We are actively exploring frameworks 
to model and assess climate risk. 
For this purpose, we have partnered 
with an independent global agency to 
source models for assessing climate 
transition risk. Additionally, we are 
committed to acquiring granular data 
and utilising BRSR data to strengthen 
our climate risk assessment tools and 
conduct scenario analysis. Given that 
climate risk is an emerging and longterm risk for the Bank, we will consider 
adopting a suitable methodology/
pathway to analyse the Bank’s 
exposures under different climate 
scenarios.

Current 
regulation
Banks are highly regulated in the country and mandates as part of current regulations are always 
integrated into the overall risk planning and assessment process. Current regulations are also 
factored in the credit assessment process, especially through the comprehensive ESG & Climate 
Change assessment framework for its wholesale corporate borrowers.
Emerging 
regulation
Transition risk can impact the Bank's credit portfolio resulting from changes in the climate policy, 
technology, consumer, and market sentiment during the transition to a low-carbon economy. This 
is particularly relevant for policy changes that can result in loan defaults from certain sectors like 
coal, thermal and infrastructure. We are actively exploring frameworks to model and assess climate 
risk. For this purpose, we have partnered with an independent global agency to source models 
for assessing climate transition risk. Additionally, we are committed to acquiring granular data and 
utilizing BRSR data to strengthen our climate risk assessment tools and conduct scenario analysis.
Technology
While our digital environment and information security standards are the foundation of our business 
today, as financial services professionals, we do not anticipate technology to have a significant 
impact on climate risk. Our low-carbon digital banking products use technology to enable business.
Legal
For large loans, we verify whether the project complies with all applicable environmental rules, failing 
to do so could result in the loan becoming a non-performing asset if the project goes into litigation. 
This, however, is not a claim against the Bank. There are no other circumstances in which the Bank 
can be held liable for a climate-related lawsuit.
Market
In the context of climate change, markets could play a key role in shifting the demand and supply 
for certain products like green loans or bonds, or in low-carbon digital products. However, we do 
recognise the relevance of change in consumer preferences, and hence, the need to evaluate this 
risk, but do not have the tools at present to quantify/include this as part of our risk assessment 
process.
Reputation
Reputation risk from community/customer perception is a primary risk to our business. We thus 
invest in community and customer involvement through surveys and structured engagements to 
educate and enlighten them on climate risks and mitigation. Further, ESG performance measures 
are increasingly being used by the global investor community, especially sovereign wealth funds and 
pension funds, to assess long-term profitable growth. We strive to implement environment-friendly 
measures throughout our operations. We further show our commitment to ESG, particularly climate 
change, by including ESG elements in regulatory reporting such as the annual report. In addition, in 
our annual integrated report, we publish details on our carbon emissions and footprint (third-party 
assured).
Acute physical
Acute physical hazards can have a negative influence on our credit portfolio by causing bad debts 
due to damage to property, infrastructure, and land. This is also relevant for climate disasters 
destroying assets (that serve as collaterals). We continue to measure physical risks from a climate 
risk assessment perspective and will assess the priority of these risks in the near-to-medium 
term. In addition, our Disaster Response and Business Continuity teams conduct business impact 
analyses and have rapid response procedures in place in the event of natural disasters such as 
floods.
Chronic physical
Chronic physical risks are far into the future. Given that climate risk is an emerging and long-term 
risk for us, we will consider adopting a suitable methodology/pathway to analyse our exposures 
under different climate scenarios.
Risk Management
Environment

Further details on our ESG strategy 
and climate change that drive the 
importance of a holistic approach 
that encompasses ESG aligned 
decision-making not only for our 
internal operational practices, but also 
extending beyond, onto our external 
financing activities are available in 
the chapter on ESG strategy and 
sustainable finance. The chapter 
also highlights our focus areas in the 
domain of sustainable finance including 
transition finance, engagement with 
borrowers to understand their best 
practices, perspective to climate 
change and net zero goals. While 
our lending procedures are guided 
by borrower and market demands, 
the bank's credit exposure is well 
diversified across numerous industries, 
with no single industry having a high 
concentration. As a result, the Bank's 
credit exposure to ecologically/socially 
sensitive industry sectors has minimal 
negative consequences. In addition, 
as part of our credit policy, we do 
not extend finance for setting up of 
new units for producing/consuming 
ozone-depleting substances (CFC 
– 11, CFC – 12, CFC – 113, Carbon 
Tetrachloride, Methyl Chloroform, 
Halons – 1211, 1301, 2402) and for 
small and medium scale units engaged 
in the manufacture of aerosol units 
using CFC.
Metrics and Targets
We have taken on an ambitious 
target for achieving carbon neutrality 
of our scope 1 and 2 emissions by 
FY32 and are already aligning our 
operations to progressively stringent 
internal benchmarks for enhancing our 
energy performance and integration 
of renewable energy. If FY24, we will 
be reviewing our performance against 
the internal benchmarks and targets 
and incorporating the best available 
technologies and practices to realign 
our integrated strategy, wherever 
required.
Additionally, we aspire to fortify our 
commitment to financing climate 
change solutions such as energy 
transition, renewables, energy 
efficiency, sustainable transportation, 
green buildings, climate smart 
agriculture, among others, and have 
already embarked on a process to 
examine our financed emissions and 
carbon-related asset exposure with 
the intent to develop KPIs and set 
goals to track the progress towards 
assisting our customers and clients in 
transitioning to a sustainable, lowcarbon economy.

The Bank has always endeavoured 
to improve customer experience and 
has adopted a holistic approach for 
the same across multiple channels 
ranging from Branch Banking, 
PhoneBanking, NetBanking, 
MobileBanking, WhatsAppBanking, 
EVA chatbot and the Bank’s social 
care handles. The Bank has also 
improvised on the relationship-based 
banking programmes by introducing 
a Virtual Relationship Manager (VRM) 
programme to cater to various financial 
needs in a personalised manner. To 
improve customer service, the Bank 
has implemented a three-step strategy 
– Define, Measure, and Improve. 
The Bank has established robust 
processes to regularly monitor and 
evaluate service quality levels not 
only at various touchpoints but 
also at a product and process level 
through the Quality Initiatives Group. 
To continuously enhance the quality 
of service, the Service Quality team 
conducts regular reviews across 
various products, processes, and 
channels. The Bank has also created a 
unique Service Quality Index (SQI) for 
its primary customer-facing channels, 
which measures their performance on 
critical customer service parameters 
and helps improve the same. 
The Bank prioritises customer service 
satisfaction as reflected in our Boardapproved Grievance Redressal Policy. 
The Grievance Redressal Policy is 
accessible to the public on our website 
and in our branches.
The Bank receives customer 
complaints largely in relation to Debit/
Credit Cards, Internet Banking, 
account operations, loans and 
advances amongst others (Refer 
Annexure 7 to the Director’s Report). 
The Bank's service quality team and 
Grievance Redressal mechanism is 
being further strengthened to prioritise 
prompt resolution of complaints. The

Net Promoter System 
(NPS) - ‘Infinite Smiles’ 
We, at the Bank, believe that delivering 
an outstanding customer experience 
is a strong differentiator for a great 
product and is key to a sustained 
competitive advantage. The primary 
aim of the Infinite Smiles programme is 
to establish employee behaviour and 
practices which leads to customercentric actions and continuous 
improvements. 
Last year, we initiated measurement 
on key journeys, identified action areas 
to improve customer experience and 
implemented several key initiatives. 
This has led to a steady improvement 
on our NPS over the year. 
This year, we built on our commitment 
to our customers by scaling the 
coverage of our Infinite Smiles 
programme – we introduced new 
journeys, new episodes and new 
products ensuring a much wider 
coverage. Customer focus has seen 
increased focus - regular cadence 
with key stakeholders and rigorous 
follow-up on actions have become the 
cornerstones of Infinite Smiles.
The programme now encompasses 
critical episodes – On-Boarding 
journeys, customer instructions, ATM 
transactions. We now cover 140+ 
episodes and have contacted around 
100 Million customers in FY23 for 
their feedback.
Our ‘Infinite Smiles’ program rests on 
three meticulously designed pillars 
– ‘Listen’; ‘Learn’; and ‘Act’ which 
enables us to embed customerfeedback led transformation as a 
discipline into our systems, challenge 
what is considered as the standard, 
and offer a customer experience that 
places us amongst the best service 
brands.
ensuring their complaints are handled 
by dedicated officers in accordance

The Bank's Board-approved Protection 
Policy limits customer liability in case 
of unauthorised electronic banking 
transactions. In addition to customer 
awareness sessions, your bank is also 
working on implementing technology 
specific risk based controls to curb the 
menace of financial frauds.
The Bank invites and reviews 
performance on customer service, 
quality of service provided and 
grievance redressal at different levels 
including Branch Level Customer 
Service Committees (BLCSCs), 
Standing Committee on Customer 
Service (SCCS) and Customer Service

Customer Centricity
This well-defined System builds on 
the Score and requires every level 
of the organization to be rigorously, 
consistently focused on the quality of 
customer and employee relationships. 
In order to foster individual learning 
and inspire front-line employees to do 
right by its customers, we created an 
advocacy organisation that ensures 
1. Sustained leadership 
commitment
Embraced the goal of creating more 
promoters and fewer detractors as 
a mission to building Service First 
Culture 
2. Building greater focus on 
understanding customer 
needs
Operationalising customer empathy, 
through Detractor engagement - 
front-line employees hear positive 
and constructive feedback directly 
from customers enabling them to 
support actions that improve customer 
experience. 
3. Robust operational and 
analytical infrastructure
Customer Experience Transformation 
team leads the effort and is 
responsible for maintaining rigor. 
It rallies across departments with 
the objective to drive the mission of 
serving the customer and bringing 
voice of customer into decision making 
4. Reliable and trusted metric
We use Net Promoter Score (NPS) 
branded as Smile Score - a simple 
and easy to understand metric which 
is reliable and valued. We have now 
embedded Smile Score and customer 
feedback as an outside-in perspective 
for measuring process efficiency. 
Infinite Smiles program is a practical 
framework to grow by enriching the 
lives of our customers and employees. 
It is the business equivalent of the 
Golden Rule: Treat others as you 
would want to be treated.
Guided by our aspiration to move 
from score to systems, we have been 
working to institutionalise the process 
for addressing customer issues that 
transcend beyond measurement and 
create a culture of customer-centricity 
and agility.
We would not only like to anticipate 
and react to changing customer 
expectations but also like to provide 
a proposition to our customers 
that makes us more attractive than 
competitive alternatives.
With this in view we subscribed to 
competitive benchmarking of NPS, 
in the form of a subscription based 
product NPS Prism®.
HDFC Bank leads the overall 
brand NPS ranking among 20+ 
competitors in the banking 
category.
Our commitment to building a 
customer obsessed culture and 
constant effort to include everyone 
in the organisation has ensured 
continuous improvement leading to 
growth in customer’s advocacy with 
the brand.

Some of our customer-centric initiatives
Vigil Aunty
As a socially responsible corporate and 
a leader in banking, we understood 
the importance of educating the 
public about safe banking practices 
in the era of digital payments. Despite 
the evolving tactics of fraudsters, 
we implemented multiple initiatives 
to drive fraud awareness among our 
employees and customers.
Realising that traditional financial safety 
ads had lost their appeal, we seized 
the opportunity to engage Indians 
through their love for Bollywood and 
social media influencers. Introducing 
our Secure Banking influencer, 
"Vigil Aunty," became our strategy 
to educate and protect Indians from 
fraudsters in an entertaining manner.
We launched Vigil Aunty on the 
75th Independence Day through 
mass announcements in leading 
newspapers. To maximize reach, 
we created thematic and contextual 
educative videos featuring Vigil Aunty 
on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, 
and Josh, where influencer-generated 
content thrives.
Through these channels, we kept 
our customers informed about the 
latest tactics employed by financial 
fraudsters, empowering them to 
detect cyber fraud attempts and stay 
safe. Additionally, we developed a 
WhatsApp Chatbot (729 0030 000) to 
provide real-time updates and insights 
into the latest news and frauds.
In just 6 months, Vigil Aunty 
garnered a staggering reach of 
146 Mn+ and built a dedicated 
fan base of over 2.3 Mn. As 
part of our commitment, we 
conducted more than 5,900 
training programmes, benefiting 
over 62,500 customers, including 
senior citizens, self-help groups, 
and law enforcement agencies.
Going beyond awareness, we 
proactively tracked online frauds 
and vulnerabilities, with a primary 
focus on protecting our HDFC Bank 
customers. Leveraging powerful tools, 
we monitored fraudsters on Google 
and social media channels. Swiftly, 
we identified and took down fake 
customer care numbers, social media 
profiles, Twitter handles, and career 
pages falsely associated with HDFC 
Bank. Our response time for removing 
such fraudulent entities was within 
24-48 hours.
From September 2022 to March 2023, 
we successfully dismantled over 
82,692 fake profiles, 1,500 counterfeit 
links, and 1,900 deceptive contacts, 
effectively mitigating risks and 
safeguarding our customers' interests.

Future Ready Digital Bank 

Modernising legacy to 
transform the Bank
To realise our vision of delivering 
a streamlined and digitally driven 
banking experience, we have 
intensified our efforts on modernisation 
by focusing on the following key areas:
Cloud Adoption
Significant progress has been made in 
HDFC Bank's cloud adoption journey, 
resulting in enhanced operations 
and improved customer services. 
By embracing the cloud, the Bank 
has achieved notable advancements 
in terms of scalability, agility, cost 
optimisation and security. Some key 
achievements include:
Scalability and Availability: 
Utilising cloud has enabled 
us rapidly scale infrastructure 
and services as per customer 
demand. With the ability to 
provision resources on-demand, 
the Bank can seamlessly handle 
peak workloads ensuring 
uninterrupted services and 
availability.
Multi-Cloud Leadership: 
HDFC Bank stands out as the 
first in the banking industry to 
establish a common landing 
zone across three different cloud 
service providers. This pioneering 
approach maximises flexibility, 
efficiency, and resilience.
Product and process 
innovation: Through the 
utilisation of cloud-based 
applications and programmes, 
HDFC Bank has achieved swift 
product and service launches, 
experimentation with innovative 
solutions, and streamlined 
internal processes. This increased 
agility has allowed the Bank to 
quickly adapt to evolving market 
dynamics and successfully 
develop notable projects like 
PayZapp 2.0, Xpress BizFinanceCLO, HDFC Streams Solution, 
and more. The key ones are 
explained in detail in the Digital 
launches section.
Data optimisation and control: 
In addition, HDFC Bank has 
undertaken the Data Lake project, 
migrating the on-premises data 
warehouse to the cloud. This 
migration has resulted in real-time 
availability of data, allowing nearreal-time processing of batch, 
structured, and unstructured 
data sources. Moreover, it has 
provided the Bank with finegrained control over data access 
based on role-based permissions, 
ensuring data security and 
privacy.
Leveraging Artificial 
Intelligence and Machine 
Learning
Leveraging the transformative 
potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
and Machine Learning (ML), HDFC 
Bank has significantly enhanced its 
operations and delivered superior 
financial services to customers. The 
following are the key benefits and 
achievements in the past year:
• Enhanced Customer 
Engagement: The integration of 
AI-ML technologies into HDFC Bank 
One and EVA Chatbot platforms has 
played a pivotal role in improving 
customer engagement. By leveraging 
AI-ML algorithms, personalised 
recommendations and tailored 
services are provided to individual 
customers, resulting in a more 
customised and satisfying banking 
experience.
• Strengthened Risk Assessment: 
HDFC Bank has initiated the 
utilisation of AI-ML models to 
enhance its risk assessment 
capabilities. This proactive approach 
enables the identification of potential 
risks and the development of 
effective mitigation strategies. The 
implementation of AI-ML models 
in Vyapar and the Bank's risk 
assessment system, has proven to 
be instrumental in ensuring robust 
risk management.
• Advanced Fraud Detection: 
The bank's robust fraud detection 
system has been further enhanced 
through the application of AI-ML 
techniques. This technology enables 
the identification and prevention of 
fraudulent activities, safeguarding 
customer transactions and protecting 
against emerging threats. The 
upcoming development of Faceless 
Authentication will further expand 
the capabilities of the Bank's fraud 
detection system.

with technology-driven solutions. 
With the aim of providing customers 
with convenient and efficient banking 
services, we have embarked on a

branch platforms provide customers 
with a range of self-service 
options, enabling them to perform 
transactions, access account

also boosted employee productivity.
Our investments in 
strengthening core 
technology are bearing fruit
Exponential growth in UPI 
volumes:

indicating a continuous upward trend. 
Moreover, the implementation of 
the Active-Active architecture of UPI 
has been successful, enabling us to 
process records from both NPCI DR 
and NPCI PR sites simultaneously. This

the foundation of our HDFC BANK UPI 
Active-Active design. UPI will further 
be enhanced with the introduction of 
UPI Lite, a digital non-interest bearing 
wallet with the ability to transact offline 
without requiring pin. The first issuer 
for the wallet is now live across the 
country.
HDFC Streams
With exponential growth in UPI 
volumes, we are geared up for the 
next UPI revolution and have recently 
developed HDFC Streams, an adaptive 
rate limiter that is deployed between 
the source and destination systems, 
whether they are located in the Cloud 
or On-premises.
HDFC Stream’s primary function is to 
intelligently manage and control the 
exchange of transactions based on 
the health of the destination system. 
The monitoring mechanism of Streams 
enables detailed performance analytics 
of the destination system, facilitating 
the early detection of any irregularities 
and preventing performance 
deterioration.
• Benchmarked to handle 5,000 
transactions per second 
against current peak observed 
of 1,350.
• Monitors & recalibrates the 
transactions at a frequency of 
4 times a second
HDFC Streams Solution will further be 
extended to cover the other financial 
transactions as well to ramp up the 
volumes.
Tokenisation
HDFC Bank is the only bank to 
implement ‘Bank Tokenisation’ in 
addition to ‘Network Tokenisation,’ 
facilitating the enablement of On-us 
transactions resulting in significant 
savings. This initiative was awarded as

Social – People 
Cultural transformation propelling 
workplace transformation
Our people are the soul 
of the Bank. Every HDFC 
Banker represents the 
Bank to its stakeholders. 
Therefore, it is our 
responsibility to ensure 
that we fully equip 
and enable them. This 
encompasses the 
organisation’s culture, 
our talent processes, 
people practices and 
employee experience. 
Organisational Culture has a deep 
impact on the employee experience 
and engagement levels of our people. 
The HDFC Bank culture framework is 
enshrined in the ‘HDFC Bank Way.’ 
It provides direction and clarity in our 
journey towards becoming a futureready Bank. 
Each pillar represents elements that the Bank stands for and believes in.
Reinforcement of the HDFC Bank Way continues to be a key focus area of the Bank.
The HDFC Bank Way
The HDFC Bank Way comprises of six defined Culture pillars -
Integrity
Innovation
Inclusion
Humility
Collaboration
Execution
"Our most important 
priorities are going 
to be in the way we 
conduct ourselves from a 
governance and compliance 
perspective, how we can 
enable a great working 
environment for our staff 
and how this can lead to 
delightful customer service."

MD & CEO- HDFC Bank

Culture transformation is a long 
term game; won over several short 
term sprints. Culture change in the 
organization gains momentum with 
small, quick wins. However, sustained 
commitment and effort is required for 
it to become part of the organization's 
fabric. Towards this a Supervisory 
Behavioral Architecture was 
introduced: Nurture, Care, Collaborate 
(NCC)'
Over the last twenty-four months, 
the intervention has covered 18,000 
frontline managers who in turn manage 
over 1,00,000 customer facing 
employees. As part of this year's 
focus on this initiative, we specifically 
covered Senior Leadership as they 
are the 'Torchbearers of Culture' in the 
Bank. A separate intervention focused 
on self-reflection and introspection 
was designed for this group of leaders. 
The program objective remained 
the same, but the intervention’s 
manifestation was more reflective and 
contemplative in design. The content 
was contextualised to reflect the reality 
of the leadership life stages and how 
to address them. The program had 
nine key themes and, was designed 
as a 3-months journey delivered 
through versatile, immersive learning 
methodology. 
Intense socialising and reinforcing 
the ‘Reason to believe’ is critical in 
any transformation journey. Keeping 
this in mind we launched NCC 
Dialogues where Senior Leaders 
across the country connected with 
the employees, especially young 
managers, and shared stories on 
how they embodied Nurture Care 
and Collaborate in their professional 
journey, challenges they encountered 
and strategies they adopted to 
overcome them. 
We also initiated an engaging and 
educative communication campaign 
for all employees on ‘Living the 
HDFC Bank Way’. Using principles of 
Transactional Analysis, we designed 
a situation-based communication 
campaign which explicitly differentiates 
and articulates the “unacceptable vs 
acceptable’ behaviour.
We have also incorporated NCC 
parameters in our Organisation and 
Manager scorecard. So, the managers 
have a perspective on how they are 
experienced as a leader and what they 
need to work on.

Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion
Inclusion is a fundamental pillar of our 
culture framework the ‘HDFC Bank 
Way.' It has been a central theme 
of the Nurture, Care, Collaborate 
intervention. Our MD and Senior 
Leadership team, during their extensive 
travel across the country, actively 
engage with officers at the grassroots 
level and reinforce the importance of 
inclusion among managers and our 
frontline employees.
We continue to prioritise our focus 
on two critical aspects of the DE&I 
agenda: 
• Gender diversity 
• Persons with Disabilities (PwD)
The governance structure established 
to set the agenda and provide strategic 
direction to DE&I initiatives continues 
to be our guiding force in accelerating 
momentum in this space.
The Council design consists of Senior 
Business Leaders along with HR at the 
Centre and in the Regions
Women at workplace
Gender diversity ratio for the Bank 
improved from 22% to 24% over the 
last 12 months. When combined with 
Sales Officers workforce, the overall 
gender ratio gets moderated to 23%
We have initiated several measures 
with an intent to a) Increase the 
diversity footprint in the Bank b) Enable 
career growth and retention of women 
c) Ensure gender equity and parity in 
pay, promotions etc.
Our Pleasant Parenthood Program is 
designed to offer a range of options 
and support primary caregivers during 
their important life stage transitions: 
pre, during, and post maternity leave. 
It includes flexibility in work timings 
and location, sensitising managers, 
performance rating protection, 
providing access to health and 
nutrition support, counselling services 
etc. 
To bolster the diversity ratio at mid 
to senior levels, we have introduced 
the ‘Career Accelerator Program’ 
(CAP) which is a holistic program 
aimed at leadership development 
of high potential women at the 
mid management levels. We have 
successfully ensured career growth 
opportunities for majority of the 
women who were part of the maiden 
program. 
We have established several channels 
of communication and connect 
with women employees by HR and 
business teams, deep dive focus 
group discussions and employee 
Pulse – Creating a Listening 
Organisation
In the process of continuously 
enhancing our listening capability, we 
have also launched PULSE, a realtime continuous listening tool that 
allows us to capture micro-experiences 
of employees on a real time basis. 
Given our scale, geographical spread 
and the pandemic realities, meeting 
employees in person had become a 
challenge. This has also accelerated 
the need to have a tool that will enable 
us to tap into what’s working and what 
can be improved on a regular basis. 
This Virtual Pulse tool gives us the 
opportunity to reach out to employees 
as often as needed, gaining real-time 
insights that can translate into quick 
actions on the ground.
Great Place to Work 
Re-Certification
HDFC Bank was certified as a Great 
Place to Work® Organisation for three 
consecutive cycles. This certification 
is also a testimony to the Bank's 
inherent strength as an Institution par 
excellence and the efforts to support 
and enable employees through 
best-in-class people practices and 
processes.

Celebrating The Bank’s 
Inclusion Day
Our Inclusion Day on June 21st 
reaffirms our commitment to the 
DE&I agenda and an occasion 
to take stock of our progress on 
the same. In FY22, the Inclusion 
Day featured inspiring speeches 
from our MD and notable figures 
such as Ms. Virginia (Ginny) 
Rometty, former CEO of IBM. We 
also collaborated with grassroots 
leaders who have made significant 
strides in empowering women in 
rural areas and driving educational 
movements. Distinguished 
speakers like Ms Chetna Gala 
Sinha, Founder of Mann Deshi 
Foundation, and Ms Shaheen 
Mistri, CEO of Teach For India, 
shared their invaluable insights 
on catalyzing social change 
on a larger scale. In addition, 
we organised regional panel 
discussions, fire side chats, and 
a month-long communication 
campaign celebrating employees' 
journeys on inclusion

Learning and 
Development
L&D aims to deliver leading edge 
learning offerings to facilitate the 
required capability development 
among employees for purpose and 
growth. Our Learning Partner model 
emphasises performance consulting 
through identifying specific business 
needs, understanding underlying 
causes and developing tailored 
capability-building strategies to 
address them effectively.
Aligned to our L&D vision, we continue 
to broaden our offering modality with 
eLearning and VILT (Virtual Instructor 
Led Training) medium, helping 
us build skills at scale. We have 
retained classroom format for select 
programmes, like onboarding. Digital 
learning initiatives along with mobile

Focus on Sales Officers
We have enhanced learning 
opportunities for our Sales Officers. 
In addition to the Swagat induction 
program designed specifically for Sales 
Officers, we have introduced Instalearn 
videos and e-learning modules based 
on the insights gathered from focused 
group discussions (FGDs) conducted 
with Sales Officers and mentors. These 
modules cover a range of topics such 
as 'Generating Sales Leads', 'Creating 
a Winning Impression', 'Basics of 
Selling Skills' and more.
To support the career progression of 
our sales officers, we have a tailored 
program to enhance their language 
and functional skills. This initiative aims 
to provide them with the necessary 
skills and knowledge to advance 
their careers and contribute to their 
professional growth.

Persons with Disabilities 
(PwD) at Work
We have progressed on our journey 
to be truly inclusive for Persons with 
Disabilities through several initiatives.
Our Inclusion Council leaders working 
closely with Human Resources, have 
been instrumental in identifying roles 
and ensuring seamless integration of 
PwD individuals into various functions 
and departments.
Our focused approach and consistent 
efforts have resulted in increase in the 
headcount of PwD employees from 
115 employees at the end of FY22 to 
197 employees at end of FY23.
In addition to increasing the 
headcount, we remain committed to 
taking steps to identify and address 
specific barriers to the inclusion 
of PwDs, ensuring a supportive 
and accessible work environment 
and inclusive leadership to enable 
an equitable and engaging work 
environment.

Leadership & Professional 
Development (LPD)
LPD is designed to ensure we remain 
a world-class institution. The LPD 
landscape is defined to nurture future 
leaders by enhancing their leadership 
effectiveness and professional skills. 
It is built to develop key leadership 
capabilities at all levels, enabling 
individuals to lead themselves, 
their teams, their functions, and the 
organisation as a whole.
In the fiscal year 2023, we 
introduced two new programs to 
further strengthen our Leadership 
Development roadmap:
Crucible: A program for midlevel managers aimed at building 
leadership skills to effectively 
translate strategy into action.
Aspiring Leaders Programme: 
Designed for senior individual 
contributors to successfully 
transition into people manager 
roles
2,100 
Sales Officers completed Career 
Progresssion Programme
1,500+ 
Sales Officers moved into

In addition to these new offerings, 
we continue to deliver our existing 
programs to address the specific 
needs of different leadership levels. 
Trailblaze, our program for frontline 
leaders, focuses on key competencies 
and management essentials, 
empowering them to enhance their 
effectiveness. Ignite, designed for 
middle management levels, places 
emphasis on collaborative and 
strategic skills, fostering courageous 
leadership in the participants. In FY24 
we aim to further scale up these 
programs.
Likewise, employees across 
various age group are sensitised on 
financial planning through curated 
program- ‘Pathway to Financial 
Planning’ SkillUp’- is a customised 
program introduced to speed up skill 
development towards job readiness for 
kin hires.

In our pursuit of continuous improvement, we have revised the methodology of calculating the time 
invested by a learner to reflect the definitive learning time investment and moved away from the seat 
time approach. 
Furthermore, CEO Club is a Talent 
development offering that is 
specifically designed for building 
future leaders at the Bank. This 
exclusive program consists of 70+ 
leaders who are selected through a 
robust talent assessment framework. 
The participants embarked on an 
immersive learning experience that 
encompassed future-oriented skills 
applicable in the BFSI industry, self 
reflection and individual coaching; 
empowering them to enhance their 
leadership capabilities and ready 
themselves for higher leadership roles 
within the organisation.
Our Life 2.0 is a specially curated six 
months long journey to support our 
retiring employees in their transition 
to post-retirement life. This six-month 
journey covers various facets such as 
healthy living, financial planning and 
leading a fulfilling life after retirement. 
Retiring employees are invited along 
with their spouse where they interact 
with our senior leaders and are also 
felicitated by them.

Talent Management 
the Digital Way 
The Bank achieved a significant 
milestone by successfully transitioning 
the Talent Management Module to 
a digital platform. This milestone 
has resulted in improved operational 
efficiency and enhanced the 
management of talent across the 
organisation. With a focus on wider 
coverage and better control of the 
talent management process, the Bank 
now has access to comprehensive 
employee data.
To support talent management efforts, 
the Bank has established a structured 
and well-documented Leadership 
Competency Framework and Functional 
Capability Framework. These 
frameworks serve as the cornerstone 
for various talent processes, providing 
clear guidelines for identifying and 
developing key competencies.
Within the Bank, a robust bi-annual 
Performance Management System 
(PMS) is in place. This system requires 
every employee to conduct a selfassessment of their performance based 
on their designated key result areas. 
Subsequently, a joint performance 
discussion takes place between the 
appraiser and the appraisee, utilising 
the self-evaluation as a foundation.
Additionally, the Bank recognises the 
importance of succession planning as 
a continuous process. This proactive 
approach aligns with other talent 
management interventions and aims 
to mitigate critical people risks, such 
as vacancy fulfilment and transition 
challenges. Succession planning 
involves providing employees with 
relevant role exposures, specific 
mentoring or coaching opportunities, 
and addressing their identified learning 
needs. By doing so, the Bank ensures 
that employees are prepared to take 
up higher responsibilities when the 
need arises.
Technological 
Enhancement in Core 
HR Modules
We are also committed to leveraging 
technology for automation, controls, 
and convenience. Accordingly, 
the Bank continued its focus on 
transitioning core HR modules to a 
common digital platform. 
One significant achievement in this 
regard, was the successful transition of 
the Talent Management module to the 
Bank's Human Capital Management 
(HCM) System. This transition resulted 
in notable improvements in transaction 
time, user experience, and controls, 
leading to significant savings.
This eliminates the need for multiple 
touchpoints and simplifies the process 
for employees, process owners, and 
decision-makers. The technology 
journey is always evolving, and the 
Bank is committed in ensuring that 
the same is leveraged on a continuous 
basis to deliver optimal value to the 
organisation.
Talent Acquisition
The FY23 proved to be an exciting 
period for talent acquisition. Our 
People strength has grown with a 
good, strong, diversified mix of talent. 
Leveraging multi-channel sourcing and 
enhancing our recruitment processes, 
we strive to ensure a steady supply 
of talent across the organisation. To 
meet our growing talent needs, we 
have embraced digitalisation and 
implemented various cost optimisation 
measures. 
Currently employee referrals constitute 
the largest source of hiring for the 
Bank. For an organisation of our scale 
a sustainable mode of resourcing is 
to build a fresher talent pool and the 
Bank over the years has invested in 
partnerships for Job-ready models. 
Over the coming years this will become 
the most significant channel for talent 
acquisition.
We initiated the process to integrate 
employees from HDB to Bank with 
a focus to reward performance 
orientation and to further enhance 
frontline and associate workforce 
employee experience. This is being 
facilitated in a phased manner 
whereby 6,000+ employees have been 
integrated. 
Gender diversity is an important 
organisational priority that is 
seamlessly integrated with the talent 
acquisition strategy. Over the year we 
have run specific women hiring drives. 
Bank Again’ is a program for hiring 
women returning after a career break 
and special tie-ups with all women 
colleges.

processes, we are strengthening 
our Talent Acquisition function and 
ensuring that we meet the talent needs 
of our organisation in a streamlined 
and efficient manner.
We launched an Applicant Tracking

scrutiny, we have also started an 
initiative to conduct pre-screening 
checks to validate critical parameters 
like basic KYC, Employment and key

Attrition
The Bank has seen increased attrition 
over the last FY mainly in the ‘nonsupervisory levels’, including Frontline 
staff and Sales Officers.
Post Pandemic, people in general 
seem to be questioning their priorities 
and revaluating their lives in ways that 
is impacting what they want from work 
they do. This has led to increased 
attrition and has impacted employers 
across industries.
At the Bank, we are also aware that 
the overall employee experience, 
especially on Culture, can be better. 
We hold RESPECT for ALL as a 
fundamental tenet in the way we 
work and relate with each other and 
the customer. However, in a large 
Organization, it is possible that there 
may be some anomalies. In these 
instances, we take quick action and 
make sure that our No Tolerance 
stance is re-emphasised.
We do have some distance to travel 
on this front. But, we are staying on 
course and doing what we can to 
accelerate the journey. In addition, 
there are concrete steps being taken 
towards building an INCLUSIVE 
ORGANSITION. We believe all this will 
go a long way in reining in attrition.

Employee Well-Being
Our flagship initiative 'HDFC Bank 
Cares' remains dedicated to providing 
resources and a platform that supports 
the physical, mental, emotional, and

To address the health issues arising 
from sedentary lifestyles and stress, 
we conduct regular health check-ups, 
Yoga workshops, stress management 
sessions, health challenges where 
employees can participate etc. We 
also provide comprehensive medical 
coverage for all our employees. 
Additionally, we have developed 
a comprehensive maternity care

we prioritize maintaining a secure 
workplace environment. Our facility 
attendants, responsible for security 
at our sites, undergo comprehensive

Rural development
With over 60% of India's population 
residing in rural areas, we strongly 
believe that inclusive development 
in India can only be attained when 
the prosperity of our villages keeps 
pace with the nation's economic 
growth. We prioritise rural areas for the 
implementation of our programmes. 
Currently, 70% of our initiatives are 
being implemented in such areas. 
Further, we have ensured the coverage 
of 75 aspirational districts (out of 
the total of 112) through our CSR 
programmes.
Our Holistic Rural Development 
Programme (HRDP), which is our 
flagship initiative aimed at identifying 
and effectively addressing the essential 
requirements of villages - spearheads 
our rural development efforts. Our 
interventions are carefully designed 
following consultations with the local 
community and other stakeholders.
HRDP conceives a comprehensive 
approach to sustainable development 
by adopting an integrated approach 
towards designing and implementing 
interventions. These interventions 
range from Natural Resource 
Management, Education, Skill 
Development and Healthcare. It 
focuses on diverse activities such 
as improving school infrastructure, 
constructing individual household 
sanitation units, providing access to 
water for drinking and irrigation, and 
promoting alternative energy sources 
like solar, biogas, and biomass 
energy. Further, the programme 
also includes organisation of health 
camps, demonstration of sustainable 
agricultural practices and initiatives 
towards soil and water conservation, 
in addition to targeted interventions for 
rural livelihood - including providing 
income-generating training for youth 
and women, creating alternate 
sources of livelihood such as livestock 
management, and promoting 
entrepreneurship activities.
Our Focused Development Programs 
(FDP) are targeted at a specific and 
limited number of goals. Under this 
initiative, we have identified three key 
targets which we are approaching in a 
focused manner.

Promoting chemical-free 
farming
• To achieve 1 lakh acres of farmland 
under chemical-free farming
Reducing the carbon and 
ecological footprint of our

• 1,000 villages to have clean and 
renewable energy solutions
Our Goals
Social - Community
Promoting chemical-free 
farming
We are passionate about promoting 
chemical-free farming. Our training 
programmes aim to educate farmers 
on various agricultural techniques that 
improve productivity while using locally 
produced manure and fertilisers while 
reducing the reliance on chemical 
fertilisers. We aim to bring 1 Lakh 
acres of farmland under chemical-free 
farming by FY25. This intervention is 
designed to allow us to maintain the 
soil, environment, and health of our 
communities.
Reducing carbon footprint
We recognise the importance of 
helping our communities reduce their 
carbon footprint. Our initiatives in this 
direction include planting trees for 
carbon sequestration & biodiversity 
conservation, and providing clean and 
renewable energy solutions to 1,000 
villages.
This goal encompasses supporting at 
least 25% of the households in each 
of the target villages by providing 
solar home lights, biomass chulha, 
biogas plants, solar study lamps, 
solar irrigation units etc. Promotion 
of biomass stoves positively impact 
women's health by improving indoor air 
quality. Also, we have planted 30 Lakh 
trees, exceeding our initial target of 25 
Lakh trees by the end of FY25.
Bringing unirrigated 
land under irrigation and 
uncultivated land under 
cultivation
We are working diligently to increase 
the cultivable land pan-India. Our 
target is to bring 1 Lakh acres of 
uncultivated land under cultivation 
augmented by bringing 2 Lakh acres 
of unirrigated land under irrigation and 
1 Lakh acre of land under cultivation 
by FY25. Our aim is to increase the 
area under cultivation and enhance 
the cropping intensity of the land, 
bolstering the agricultural sector.

Promotion of Education
We are committed to improving the 
quality of education in India and are 
aligned with the Government of India's 
Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan.
Parivartan's education programmes 
focus on teacher training, providing 
scholarships, career guidance, school 
infrastructural support, promoting 
innovation through the identification 
and replication of innovative practices, 
and improving education quality 
through remedial classes, learning 
camps, and teacher learning material.
It also provides special scholarships to 
support education for underprivileged 
children. In addition, we also support 
improving school infrastructure through 
refurbishment, setting up libraries and 
science labs, and providing sports 
materials. These efforts have helped to 
enhance the learning environment and 
outcomes for thousands of children 
across the country.

Our Targets
To convert 3,500 traditional

To support 25,000 meritorious 
underprivileged students with 
scholarships.
To cover 20 lakh students at class 
appropriate learning levels in all 
intervention schools
Our Goals
Smart Classes
These classes leverage interactive 
whiteboards and digital content 
to provide a more engaging and 
immersive learning experience 
for students. As a result, students 
have demonstrated improved 
academic performance and 
increased engagement in 
the classroom. We have also 
introduced Smart Classes in 
different states to integrate 
technology with education.
Improving learning-level 
outcomes
Our goal is to achieve classappropriate learning (CAL) levels for 
70% of students in all schools under 
intervention. Overall, we target to cover 
20 Lakh students by FY25 pan-India 
under this endeavour. We have defined 
the CAL levels to be achieved as 
per the NCERT framework and have 
assessed the improvement against 
the National Achievement Survey 
(NAS). We believe that the successful 
implementation of this dimension will 
ensure that students have a strong 
foundation in their subjects and 
are well-equipped to pursue higher 
education and other opportunities in 
the future.
Creation of Smart Schools
We aim to transform 3,500 traditional 
schools into smart schools by FY25, 
which will create a conducive learning 
environment for students and enable 
teachers to utilise various teaching aids 
and tools.
To ensure the successful 
implementation of this objective, we 
have identified six building blocks for 
the development of smart schools. 
Furthermore, we will provide targeted 
support to each school based on 
a detailed need assessment and 
situational analysis of the availability of 
adequate infrastructure such as space 
and electricity.
Educational Crisis Scholarship 
Support (ECSS)
We believe that financial or personal 
crises should not hamper the 
development of bright young minds. 
Through scholarships under our 
ECSS Programme, we are supporting 
identified economically challenged or 
students in crisis. We target to cover 
25,000 such students by FY25 by 
providing scholarships to continue their 
education and preventing dropouts 
due to crises.

Skill Development 
and Livelihood 
Enhancement
We are dedicated to supporting 
various projects aimed at empowering 
disadvantaged individuals by developing 
their skills and competencies. 
Under the overarching theme of capacity 
development, we have established 
separate goals for individual and 
institutional enhancement.

Our Goals
Our Targets
Increase in individual income
• Increase in income of ~5 Lakh 
farmers across the country
• Skilling of youth
• Development and sustenance of 
20,000 institutions
• To have Local Economic Activation 
with 25,000 community-led 
enterprises promoted with ~50% 
being women-led
Increase in individual income
The first goal is enhancing income with 
focus on underprivileged farmers, youth 
and women. We have devised three 
distinct sub-goals to approach this in a 
targeted and methodical manner.
Increasing the income of small 
and marginal farmers
Our first sub-goal is aimed at increasing 
the income of 5 Lakh small and marginal 
farmers by FY25 with an annual income 
under C60,000 by optimising their output 
and minimising their input costs. To 
achieve this, we are equipping farmers 
with contemporary and innovative 
farming tools and techniques by 
organising visits to various agricultural 
institutes and fields, and providing 
them with seeds, fertilisers, and other 
necessary support materials. We are 
also encouraging farmers to diversify 
their income by supporting them in 
allied activities such as livestock rearing, 
horticulture, timber, and fishery, among 
others.
Promoting 25,000 community-led 
enterprises
The second sub-goal focuses on 
promoting 25,000 community-led 
enterprises to stimulate local economic 
activity, with ~50% of these being led 
by women. We encourage economically 
deprived communities to engage in 
entrepreneurship on an individual 
or cluster basis. We support the 
identification of prospective economic 
activities in the intervention villages

Skill development for employment 
generation
The third sub-goal is on skill 
development for employment 
generation, and we are providing 
classroom/online/blended skill training 
to unemployed youth, school dropouts, 
and landless farmers. Our training 
programs come with certifications from

of institutions
Our second goal is aimed at the 
development and sustenance of 
institutions for livelihood enhancement, 
primarily community institutions such 
as village development committees, 
farmers’ groups, SHGs, water user 
groups, sanitation committees, youth 
groups, and adolescent groups. Our 
target is to develop and support 20,000 
community institutions by FY25, and 
our interventions could span from a few 
months to three years. The activities 
we engage in are related to agriculture, 
water, sanitation, health, livelihood, and 
other rural development work.
Social - Community

Healthcare and 
Hygiene
We take a holistic approach to 
healthcare and hygiene, enabling 
healthcare services like health 
clinics, providing medical equipment, 
organising nutrition programmes 
and immunisation drives, while also 
promoting hygiene and sanitation in 
schools and communities. In addition, 
Waste Management is one of our 
major intervention areas.
We are working towards 
institutionalisation of waste pickers 
through targeted interventions for 
their social and financial inclusion. 
This complements our community-led 
sanitation initiatives for proper disposal 
of wastewater.
Our interventions are centred on 
championing the Swachh Bharat 
Abhiyan through various activities 
including awareness campaigns that 
bring about behavioural changes, 
construction of toilets, organising 
health camps, generating awareness 
about nutrition, providing access to 
clean drinking water, and conducting 
blood donation drives.

Our Targets
Improve sanitation facility
• 1,000 villages to have a solid 
waste management systems 
in place and 15 ULBS to have 
Material Recovery Facilities 
(MRFS)
• 1,000 villages to have access to 
clean drinking water
Our Goals
Access to clean drinking 
water
The second sub-goal focuses on 
providing clean drinking water access 
to 1,000 villages. Our interventions 
include promoting clean drinking water 
availability at both the community 
level, through Jal-minar or other water 
buildings, and at the family level, 
through piped water connections. Our 
interventions will result in making three 
litres of water available per person per 
day. We are also forming and orienting 
water user groups to ensure that the 
services are sustainable, with postproject maintenance and water quality 
testing entrusted to these groups.
Waste management
Our first sub-goal involves developing 
waste management systems in 15 
Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) and 
1,000 villages. Our commitment 
to establishing a long-term solid 
waste management system involves 
providing the necessary infrastructure, 
instilling behavioural changes towards 
responsible consumption, source 
segregation, and litter prevention. 
Our interventions include setting 
up material recovery and recycling 
facilities in the 15 ULBs, as well as 
implementing village-level interventions 
such as residential composting, doorto-door garbage collection, and related 
mechanisms for user fee collection, 
compost sales, and recycling.

Financial Literacy and 
Inclusion
Achieving true financial inclusion 
is a vital goal that requires a multipronged approach. Our programme 
is committed to promoting financial 
literacy and empowering communities 
to make informed financial decisions.
We offer financial literacy workshops 
to provide essential knowledge about 
savings and investments, as well as 
access to organised finance sources. 
We also conduct financial literacy 
camps and nurture SHGs to promote 
financial literacy. The objective of these 
camps is to provide communities 
with the necessary knowledge to 
make informed decisions about their 
finances. Credit counselling is carried 
out in schools, colleges, and among 
senior citizens and pensioners.
Additionally, we have established 
financial literacy centres across India 
to further this cause. As part of our 
commitment to promoting financial 
literacy, we collaborate with our 
non-profit partners to enhance the 
effectiveness of our efforts.

Ladakh Glacier 
Intervention
Ayee village, Panamik Block, Nubra Subdivision, Leh-Ladakh
Given the increasing global 
temperatures and melting of natural 
glaciers, constructing artificial glaciers 
and tapping winter water resources 
in the form of ice becomes crucial for 
addressing water scarcity.
Artificial glaciers are a sustainable 
solution for water conservation and 
management, as they conserve 
water, are energy-efficient, involve 
local communities, adapt to local 
conditions, and build climate resilience 
in water-scarce regions like Ladakh. 
We are supporting the construction 
of an Artificial Glacier in Ayee village, 
Nubra Subdivision, in partnership 
with the Himmotthan Society. The 
project aims to address water scarcity 
during the spring and sowing season, 
benefiting 42 households and 105 
acres of agricultural land.
It provides assured irrigation, increases 
agricultural productivity, and creates 
job opportunities.
Beneficiary: 14 athletes
Beneficiary: 42 households

Water Hyacinth 
Handicrafts Training 
Project
Authoor Village and Kottarakurichi village, Thoothukudi, Tamil Nadu
We partnered with Society for 
the Upliftment of Villagers and 
Development of Himalayan Areas 
(SUVIDHA). Sixty women beneficiaries 
were provided with training and 
specialized craft toolkits for harvesting 
and processing water hyacinth stem.
The women were provided training 
in drying and storage processing, 
weaving flat products using a 
handloom, basket-weaving and mouldmaking. Following the completion of 
the project, several key milestones 
have been achieved. Weaver groups 
collaborated with IKEA through 
Ramesh Flower Company, showcasing 
sample products and generating a 
potential increase in demand for water 
hyacinth products. There have already 
been commitments by government 
representatives to scale up the 
project in the district and expand it 
to six neighbouring villages. These 
developments signify promising 
prospects for the future growth and 
success of the project.
Reviving the Screw Pine 
Craft Based Livelihoods 
in Kuttanad Region 
Kuttanad, Kerala
We initiated a project to revive Screw 
Pine Craft-Based Livelihoods in the 
Kuttanad Region. As part of the 
program, 5,000 screw pine saplings 
were distributed. Thirty women 
artisans from six villages received 
intensive training in making handicrafts 
using dried screw pine plants. The 
training expanded their skills and 
transformed their outlook, leading 
to the creation of innovative designs 
and a variety of crafted items. The 
project successfully reorganized the 
previously inactive artisan group and 
ensured raw material availability. An 
officer was appointed to improve 
production and develop sustainable 
market opportunities. The project also 
formed links with the Directorate of 
Handicrafts for additional skill training 
and participated in regional exhibitions 
and the India International Trade Fair, 
in 2021.
The reorganised Screw Pine Artisan 
group of 30 women has achieved 
remarkable results. Each artisan 
now earns an average gross annual 
income of C1,79,125, providing an 
additional income of C4,000 per 
month. The project established a 
Common Facility Centre for training 
and processing, ensuring a steady 
supply of raw materials. The artisans 
received training in innovative designs, 
resulting in improved product quality 
and quantity. The initiative has created 
sustainable market systems, promoting 
local economic activation. This project 
has brought economic prosperity, 
reduced workload, and empowered 
women in the community.

Supporting Tribal 
Communities 
with Livelihood 
Diversification
Kachhar Village, Raigarh District, Chhattisgarh 
Janki Sidar is a daily wage labourer 
from a tribal community. Due to a lack 
of irrigation facilities and limited land 
resources, she was unable to use her 
50-decimal land for meeting her dayto-day needs.
To overcome this challenge, we 
established a livelihood diversification 
project. The introduction of a 
combination of mushroom cultivation 
and backyard poultry and support 
with agricultural equipment like spawn, 
formalin, carbendazim, plastic bags, 
drum, sprayer, and crate helped her to 
earn an incremental income.
She now considers mushroom 
cultivation as a less labour-intensive 
and more profitable business.
Apart from adding to the family 
income, it has also helped her add 
nutritional value to daily household 
consumption. She is also providing 
handholding support to other 
vulnerable households.

Applying Collective 
Approach for 
Upliftment of Dairy 
Farmers
Village Puraposar, District Guna, 
Madhya Pradesh
Due to a lack of exposure to good 
practices, Bantibai Lodha from village 
Puraposar was forced to sell milk to 
local middlemen at a lower price than 
the fair market price. She was unable 
to sustain her livelihood and also had 
less money for cattle feed, fodder and 
vegetable farming.
In association with Endpoverty 
India's 'Mahila Kisaan Sangathan', 
we launched interventions for the 
upliftment of the female dairy farmers 
and their families, under HRDP. They 
formed 'Guna Vikas Mahila Farmer 
Producer Ltd' - a dairy collective and 
conducted training programmes on 
good dairy and agriculture practices. 
The complete value chain from 
production to marketing of milk and 
milk products was set up and systems 
for timely payment and bonuses to 
shareholders were rolled out.
Today, many small dairy farmers like 
Bantibai Lodha sell approximately 7 
to 8 litres of milk at Farmer Producer 
Company (FPC)'s Bulk Milk Cooler 
(BMC) unit where they get a fair price 
of C47 per litre on average, based on 
the quality and quantity of the milk. 
Weekly payments are transferred 
directly into their bank accounts. Dairy 
farmers have an assured market for 
their milk produce and middlemen 
have been eliminated from the value 
chain. Bantibai now earns C10,000 per 
month- an over 100% increase from 
her pre-project income.

Nation Building 
Contributing to India’s development
It is committed to extending banking 
services to the unbanked population 
through innovative solutions and 
digital initiatives. Furthermore, HDFC 
Bank supports the growth of the 
startup ecosystem and actively 
participates in the Government's 
efforts to foster financial inclusion. As 
a socially responsible institution, HDFC 
Bank continues to make significant 
contribution to India's development 
and progress.
Unlocking efficiencies in 
Government fund distribution 
through digitisation
The Bank is dedicated to supporting 
the Government's nation-building 
agenda through its focus on digitising 
payments. The goal is to enable easier 
distribution and monitoring of allocated 
funds for a multitude of Government 
schemes that benefit many sections 
of society. Additionally, HDFC Bank 
plays a vital role in collecting direct and 
indirect taxes and facilitating digital 
commerce through integration with 
Government-owned platforms.
This year, HDFC Bank was 
awarded the highest number of 
mandates amongst the private 
sector banks for SNA (Single 
Nodal Agency) accounts.
Water and Sanitation
Water management and provision of 
clean drinking (potable) water to all its 
citizens has been a major focus for the 
Government. 
HDFC Bank has contributed to the 
Government of India’s mission to 
provide potable water to every rural 
household through their tap water 
connection by 2024. The Bank has 
done this in two ways. It has worked 
with states like Meghalaya and 
Maharashtra to manage and distribute 
funds to implementing agencies such 
as district and gram panchayats for 
the Jal Jeevan Mission, a centrallysponsored scheme. Secondly, 
the Bank has also helped monitor 
implementation of various initiatives 
under the scheme by providing a 
centralised digital inter-face for use by 
state authorities. 
The Government of India also 
focussed on improving the overall 
infrastructure for its citizens by 
improving basic services including 
water, sewage, transport etc. The Bank 
has contributed to this by working 
with nine State Governments in the 
successful implementation of the Atal 
Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban 
Transformation (AMRUT) scheme. 
This centrally-sponsored scheme is 
supported by the Bank through timely 
and efficient distribution of funds to 
implementation agencies. 
HDFC Bank remains 
dedicated to its active 
role in nation-building 
through a range of 
initiatives. Through 
collaborations with 
State Governments, 
the Bank facilitates the 
efficient distribution 
of funds, contributing 
to increasing access 
to essential services 
like water, sanitation, 
healthcare, and 
education. 

The Government of India has also 
undertaken multiple, large-scale 
schemes at the national level such as 
‘Swachh Bharat Mission’, ‘National 
Water Mission’ and ‘Waste to Wealth 
Mission’ as part of its commitment 
to effective waste and pollution 
management. HDFC Bank has worked 
at the grass-root level to ensure 
efficient distribution of funds for all 
these schemes. 
Digitising Gram Panchayats
The Bank continues to maintain focus 
on the rural ecosystem by increasing 
penetration at the district, block, and 
Gram Panchayat levels. It offers digital 
banking facilities to Gram Panchayats, 
prioritising BharatNet connected Gram 
Panchayats. Overall, the Bank has 
processed 124 Million transactions 
across all Government schemes 
which makes it one of the top banks 
to support Government initiatives 
in the country. The Bank was also 
recognised for its contribution in Direct 
Benefit Transfers through the Public 
Financial Management System (PFMS) 
by the Ministry for Agriculture and 
Farmer Welfare (MoAFW).
Healthcare
The Bank continued to support the 
digitisation of the healthcare sector 
by enabling the efficient and smooth 
transfer of funds from apex bodies like 
the Ministry of Health to grass-root 
levels like village hospitals. Through 
its continued focus and effort, the 
Bank has helped mobilise funds under 
healthcare schemes across multiple 
states. 
While enabling timely movement 
of funds across many levels of 
implementing agencies, the Bank 
also helps the Government monitor 
utilisation of these funds by providing 
a central fund-monitoring-interface. 
This provides the all-important visibility 
into distribution of funds at the granular 
level. 
Education and Nutrition
The Bank’s focus on helping improve 
the nutritional needs of future 
generations continues. HDFC Bank 
worked with education departments 
across states to make funds available 
in a timely manner to ensure that the 
nutritional needs of the school going 
students are met. 
Partnerships with the Government 
have benefitted 
over 15 million 
children across 
1 Lakh+ schools.
The Bank also takes great pride in 
enabling disbursements of funds to 
the last mile for Samagra Shiksha 
Abhiyaan Scheme. The scheme 
helps in improvement of school 
infrastructure, upskills teachers and 
provides financial aid for text-books 
and uniforms.
Bolstering revenue collections
The Bank retained the status of the 
leading bank for Direct Tax collections 
in FY2022-23, as recognised by 
the Controller General of Accounts, 
Government of India.
In line with the Government's initiatives 
of 'Ease Of Doing Business' and 
'Digital India', the Bank has seamlessly 
integrated with various Government 
platforms and systems including TIN 
2.0, GSTN, ICEGATE, Railways Freight, 
EPFO, ESIC, and MCA21.
Through its integration with TIN 2.0, 
the Bank has offered a wider tax 
collection network to its customers

CollectNow
The Bank’s CollectNow offering 
provides an industry-first, omnichannel 
collection solution. Customers are 
seamlessly onboarded with a single 
set of documents. 15+ retail and 
wholesale collection modes are 
made available such as Cards, UPI, 
QR codes, NetBanking, eCMS, and 
over the counter payments. More 
importantly, it provides unique benefits 
such as a single settlement cycle for 
cards, UPI and other modes compared 
to the current three settlement cycles. 
Customers receive a single payout 
report making reconciliation easy. 
Digitising institutions
The Bank has worked with more than 
7,000 institutions and helped them 
digitise their collections and payouts 
to improve overall efficiency. Digitally 
penetrated accounts offer the Bank 
3x to 30x higher deposit values versus 
non-penetrated ones. Institutions in the 
religious, education, housing societies, 
clubs and not-for-profit segments have 
benefited from our digital solutions, 
which are easy to use. For example, 
we help religious institutions and 
housing societies deploy QR codes to 
collect donations and dues, instead of 
cash. QR codes placed on every floor, 
ease collection of society dues. Digital 
solutions for educational institutions 
enable better management of 
inflows, provide for seamless student 
onboarding, and timely expense 
management. 
FARSight
Having clear visibility of fund 
movement, ensuring expenses 
are within approved budgets and 
forecasting are key needs of any 
successful enterprise. The FARSight 
dashboard created by the Bank, 
especially for its Government and 
Institutional customers, is a userfriendly tool which allows them to do 
exactly that. They can slice and dice 
transaction data and monitor limits 
through this dashboard. 
Enabling Social Security
HDFC Bank has continued its service 
to the senior citizens of the nation 
by extending its pension services 
across the Railways and Defence 
departments.
The Bank integrated with the Railway 
CRIS system to enable digital 
disbursement of pensions to retiring 
Railway officials. 
The Bank has also signed a 
Memorandum of Understanding 
(MoU) with the Defence department 
to enable its branch network as a 
Pension Service Network for Defence 
Pensioners through the Government’s 
SPARSH (System for Pension 
Administration) portal.
Leveraging Government 
partnerships to fuel 
entrepreneurship 
Partnerships with the Government 
have enabled the Bank to deliver a 
strong performance in what was a 
challenging year for the Indian Startup eco-system. The Bank forged 
partnerships with various Central 
and State Government entities like 
Innovation for Defence Excellence 
(iDEX DIO), Karnataka Innovation and 
Technology Society, Kerala Startup 
Mission, Uttar Pradesh Electronics 
Corporation and MSME Department 
and Government of Madhya Pradesh. 
HDFC Bank is also amongst the early 
movers in rolling out the Government’s 
Credit Guarantee Scheme for Startups (CGSS) catering to the lending 
requirements of start-ups registered 
with the Department for Promotion of 
Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT).
Leveraging the HDFC Bank CSR 
programme, Parivartan, grants 
were given to 33 Incubators 
and 90 Start-ups. These were 
executed in partnership with 
Startup India, an initiative of DPIIT. 
Taking banking to the 
unbanked
The Bank is fully committed to taking 
banking to the remotest parts of the 
country through a combination of 
an extensive physical network and a 
robust digital suite of products and 
services. Today, about half of our 
branches are located in rural and semiurban areas. We also offer last mile 
access through mobile applications 
such as BHIM, UPI, USSD, Scan and 
Pay, and Aadhaar & RuPay enabled 
Micro-ATMs.
To bring more under-banked 
sections of the population into formal 
financial channels, the Bank has 
opened over 29.18 Lakh accounts 
under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan 
Yojana (PMJDY) and enrolled 41.73 
Lakh customers in social security 
schemes since inception. We have 
been consistently ranked among the 

leading private sector banks in this 
regard. The Bank has conducted 
Financial Literacy camps through Rural 
Branches and designated Financial 
Literacy Centers. In the year under 
review, loans to the tune of C14,551 
Crore to 18.82 Lakh beneficiaries were 
extended under the Pradhan Mantri 
Mudra Yojana (PMMY) and nearly 
C344 Crore to 1,502 beneficiaries 
under the ‘Stand up India’ scheme 
to Scheduled Caste, Scheduled 
Tribe and women borrowers. The 
Bank has also actively supported PM 
Street Vendor’s AtmaNirbhar Nidhi 
(PMSVANIDHI) a special scheme under 
micro-credit facility for street vendors 
with a collateral free affordable term 
loan of C10,000 for 1 year. The Bank 
has disbursed C10,000 each to 29,984 
street vendors to support them and 
has also educated them in using 
the digital mode for making financial 
transactions. The Bank provides 
services for Aadhaar enrolment and 
updation in branches designated as 
‘Aadhaar Seva Kendras’ in accordance 
with Regulatory guidelines. These 
‘Aadhaar Seva Kendras’ have 
processed more than 5.3 Million 
enrolments and updations since being 
set-up.
Playing a pivotal role in promoting 
Financial and Economic Inclusion
HDFC Bank has played a significant 
role in promoting financial and 
economic inclusion by tying up with 
Business correspondent agents and 
Business Facilitator agents to provide 
banking services to customers in 
underserved and unbanked areas. This 
journey started in 2018 by partnering 
with Common Service Centres (CSCs) 
and has now grown into tie-ups with 
five more corporates increasing our 
agent network further.
With the help of BCs, the Bank has 
been able to expand its footprint in 
remote and rural areas, where the 
penetration of traditional banking 
services is low. Banking agents are 
providing services such as cash 
deposit and withdrawal, social security 
schemes, opening of savings accounts 
and lending to marginalised sections 
and small businesses through SLI 
Loans, Gold Loan, KGC, Agri Loans, 
Business Loan and working 
capital loan.
45+ 
Banking products and services can 
be accessed via this network.
These BC Agents and BF Agents are 
local entrepreneurs belonging to the 
neighbourhood who are trained and 
authorised by the Bank to provide 
banking products digitally and in a 
convenient way. This has helped to 
promote financial inclusion and has 
contributed to the overall development 
of the country's economy.
40 Lakh 
Banking products provided 
till date across the country 
through these agents
Providing credit for marginal 
sections and agri ecosystem
Another key element of HDFC Bank's 
approach is its focus on lending to 
marginal sections including farmers, 
small businesses, and traders. The 
Bank has launched several initiatives 
through BC and BF Agents for 
promoting access to credit for these 
segments, including the provision of 
collateral-free loans and microfinance 
products. These have helped to

2.92 Lakh 
Farmer accounts opened through 
alternate channels to support 
the agricultural ecosystem of the 
country.
Lending to Marginal sections
Additionally, HDFC Bank has focused 
on empowering women and Self Help 
Groups (SHGs) through its agent 
network. With SLI Loans, the Bank 
provides Self Help Groups access to 
credit and financial services, helping 
to promote entrepreneurship and 
self-employment. Social Security 
Schemes help create financial safety 
net at affordable cost for the marginal 
sections. Thus paving way for Financial 
Inclusion in deeper geographies 
through the agent network.

Digital adoption in banking
HDFC Bank has been at the forefront 
of leveraging digital technology to 
expand access to financial services for 
the underserved population in India. 
BCs are now offering a range of digital 
services such as mobile banking, 
Aadhaar-enabled payment system 
(AEPS), and digital loan processing.
Supported Digi Gaon drive of Govt. 
of India.
4,363 
Villages positively impacted by 
providing them with laptops and 
digital infrastructure.
Our Business Correspondent network 
of 15,000+ agents are digitally 
capacitated to not just provide credit 
but also collect the instalments of 
these loans removing the hassle of 
long travel to branches.
EMIs collected: 1.76 Lakh+ 
transactions across retail and SLI/
JLG loans.
This has not only made banking more 
convenient for customers but has 
also helped to reduce the cost-ofservice delivery for the Bank. It has 
also enabled to reach out to a larger 
customer base, including those who 
were previously excluded from formal 
financial services due to geographical 
and economic barriers.
Recognised as Best Financial 
Institution in Digital Innovation, at 
Bharat Fintech Summit 2023
Another major step in digital adoption 
has been the launch of HDFC Bank 
Smart Saathi - a digital distribution 
platform, which will help onboard 
agents across existing and new 
corporate partners with speed and 
scale, provide on-ground support and 
customised training to agents and 
ensure seamless delivery of banking 
products across geographies.

a comprehensive whistle-blower policy, 
among other best practices.
Board expertise and 
competence
At HDFC Bank, we go beyond mere 
regulatory compliance to establish 
robust governance practices. 
Compliance with regulatory 
requirements serves as the foundation, 
but we have consistently placed 
emphasis on ensuring that the

the Board also seeks inputs from 
external experts to enhance decisionmaking. For more detailed information

Culture of transparency and 
accountability
At HDFC Bank, we prioritise the 
adoption of global best practices 
in governance, ensuring timely 
disclosures and fair presentation 
of information. Transparency and 
accountability are key expectations 
of our stakeholders. To meet these 
expectations, we have established 
policies and processes that enable 
a sufficient and visible flow of 
information while implementing 
necessary safeguards. In compliance 
with the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider 
Trading) Regulations, 2015, we have 
formulated a Code of Practices and 
Procedures for Fair Disclosures, 
emphasising prompt disclosure and 
universal dissemination of information. 
To strengthen our governance 
framework, the Board has approved 
various policies, which are accessible 
on our website for easy reference. 
These policies include the Policy 
on Appointment and Fit and Proper 
criteria for Directors, the Whistle 
Blower Policy, the Compensation 
Policy and the Conduct Philosophy 
(Code of Conduct). These policies 
reflect our commitment to maintaining 
high standards of integrity, ethics, 
and fairness in all aspects of our 
operations.
Policies and frameworks for 
ethical conduct
To foster a culture of ethical 
behavior, we have established the 
right environment and implemented 
policies and frameworks that promote 
appropriate business conduct. These 
policies are regularly communicated 
to our management, employees, and 
stakeholders.

encompass various areas, including:
• Code of Ethics/Conduct
• Policies to prevent insider trading and 
govern related-party transactions
• Policies on Prevention of Sexual 
Harassment (POSH)
• Environmental Social & Governance 
(ESG) Policy Framework
Transparency and accountability are 
deeply ingrained in our organisational 
culture. Our Code of Ethics/Conduct 
directs the Board and senior 
management to uphold our values 
and conduct business with integrity 
and the highest ethical standards. 
We strictly adhere to our Conduct 
Philosophy, which prohibits the use of 
child, forced, or compulsory labor in 
our operations.

ESG governance
The Bank's commitment to ESG 
matters continues to be a vital part of 
its governance framework. The CSR 
and ESG Committee of the Board 
oversees the Bank's sustainability 
and climate change initiatives. This 
committee is now guided by the 
ESG apex council, which consists 
of key representatives from senior 
management. The apex council 
maintains its responsibility for 
overseeing sustainability initiatives, 
reporting, climate change disclosures, 
and internal projects aimed at reducing 
the Bank's overall emissions. Their 
primary objective remains tracking 
progress with respect to our ESG 
goals to achieve industry leadership
To support the ESG apex council, 
the Bank has established ESG action 
working groups. These working groups 
include the Product Responsibility 
Working Group, which evaluates 
ESG risks, including climate risks, in 
the existing portfolio and identifies 
ESG-linked opportunities. The 
Environment Working Group oversees 
the Bank's environmental impact from 
its operations, while the Social and 
Governance Working Group focuses 
on workplace policies and governance 
initiatives.
This evolved structure ensures 
that ESG matters are consistently 
addressed and integrated into the 
Bank's operations. The Bank remains 
steadfast in its pursuit of sustainability 
goals and its commitment to 
maintaining industry leadership in ESG 
practices.

Dear Stakeholders,
Your Directors take great pleasure in presenting the 29th Annual 
Report on the business and financial operations of your Bank, 
together with the audited accounts for the year ended March 
31, 2023.
The year gone by has been the first normal/near normal one in 
the last three years as the world largely shook off the effects of 
the pandemic and spread cheer. 
On the economic front, India's GDP grew by 7.2 per cent in 
Financial Year 2022-23 compared to 9.1 per cent in the preceding 
year as per the Central Statistical Organisation. The higher 
growth last year in Financial Year 2021-2022 was largely due to 
the negative impact of the pandemic in Financial Year 2020-21.
Growth was supported by pent up consumption demand and 
easing of supply – side constraints as the economy recovered 
from pandemic induced disruptions. Increased Government 
spending improved investment momentum and in turn supported 
the recovery of private sector capital expenditure
Overall systemic liquidity remained in surplus for much of the 
last financial year. However, RBI started raising rates from May 
2022 onwards, cumulatively increasing by 250 basis points. 
Global headwinds resulted in slowing export momentum in the 
second half of financial year 2022-23 and 2023-24 GDP growth 
forecast being revised by 200 basis points. Although, Indian 
banks remain relatively immune to the effects of US regional 
banking turmoil, ripple effects of the global turmoil are likely to 
be felt on domestic markets due to high inflation, geopolitical 
tensions and persistent but continuing localised disruptions of 
the COVID-19 pandemic. 
In the long run however, we see resilience in the domestic 
market against future headwinds as India remains one of the 
fastest growing economies globally. External stability indicators 
continue to remain healthy. Internal consumption demand is 
being supported by the rationalisation of income tax slabs as 
well as 37.4 per cent increase in capital expenditure to ` 10 lakh 
crore in the Union Budget for 2023-24.
For more details, please refer to the Macroeconomic and 
Industry section on page no. 173.
Your Bank continued to grow in this environment by conducting 
its business responsibly and reinforcing its commitment to the 
environment and community at large.

Summary
Going forward we expect global headwinds to weigh on 
domestic economic outlook. The International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) in its latest projections has pared India’s growth forecast for 
2023-24 to 5.9 per cent from 6.1 per cent earlier citing upward 
revision in base and tightening monetary conditions. However, 
India remains one of the fastest growing economies in the world. 
Despite the presence of inflationary pressures and geopolitical 
uncertainties, the country has the capacity to absorb these 
challenges. The market continues to be underpentrated providing 
growth avenues for banking services in the country. Your Bank is 
well-positioned to capitalize on these opportunities, leveraging

On the supply side, services growth strengthened further with 
improvement in contact-based services, led by trade, transport 
and hospitality. Construction too experienced healthy growth 
as it continued the strong momentum from the previous year. 
Financial services and agriculture remained steady while 
manufacturing growth remained low, growing by 1.3 per cent 
in 2022-23. However, capacity utilisation in manufacturing has 
improved, signalling that built up inventories have cleared, 
and we might see an improvement in manufacturing activity 
going forward. 
Strong and continued support by the Government including 
extension of the credit guarantee scheme and Garib Kalyan Anna 
Yojana (Free food programme, till December 2022) and the rural 
job guarantee programme helped in sustaining the recovery. 
The near universal administering of COVID-19 vaccine (over 220 
crore doses with more than 102 crore individuals administered 
at least one dose) has provided cover from the continuous threat 
of new virus variants. 
Overall systemic liquidity remained in surplus for much of 202223. However, RBI started raising rates from May 2022 onwards, 
cumulatively increasing the rates by 250 basis points through 
the year. This was necessitated mostly due to external factors. 
Geopolitical tensions and sanctions, elevated prices of crude oil 
and other commodities and lingering COVID-19 related supply 
chain bottlenecks exacerbated global uncertainties. However, 
supply disruptions have now normalised, and domestic 
inflationary pressures are showing signs of moderation as well. 
Going forward we expect global headwinds to weigh on 
domestic economic outlook. The International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) in its latest projections has pared India’s growth forecast for 
2023-24 to 5.9 per cent from 6.1 per cent earlier citing upward 
revision in base and tightening monetary conditions. However, 
India remains one of the fastest growing economies in the world. 
Global economic activity continues to experience a slowdown 
due to a combination of factors. These include high inflation, 
geopolitical tensions in Europe and elsewhere, and persistent 
but localised disruptions due to COVID-19 pandemic. Further, 
the US regional banking turmoil has led to volatility in the financial 
markets, accentuating downside risks to global economic 
prospects. This was cited as a major reason for downward 
revision of global growth forecasts by the IMF in its economic 
outlook. Though India and Indian banks remain relatively 
insulated from the banking turmoil, materialisation of adverse 
outcomes in the global markets is likely to have ripple effects 
on domestic markets as well. Moreover, India is relatively better 
positioned to respond to any adverse global shocks with external 
stability related indicators (Short-term debt, Forex reserves, FDI 
flows) remaining healthy. 
Issuance of Equity Shares and Employee Stock 
Option Scheme (ESOP)
As on March 31, 2023, the issued, subscribed and paid-up 
capital of your Bank stood at ` 5,579,742,786/- comprising 
5,579,742,786 equity shares of ` 1/- each. Further, 34,201,810 
equity shares of face value of ` 1/- each were issued by your Bank 
pursuant to the exercise of Employee Stock Options (ESOPs). 
(For information pertaining to ESOPs, please refer Annexure 1 
of the Directors’ Report).
Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)
As on March 31, 2023, your Bank’s total CAR, calculated as 
per Basel III Regulations, stood at 19.3 per cent, well above 
the regulatory minimum requirement of 11.7 per cent, including 
a Capital Conservation Buffer of 2.5 per cent and an additional 
requirement of 0.2 per cent on account of the Bank being 
identified as a Domestic Systemically Important Bank. Tier I 
Capital was at 17.1 per cent as of March 31, 2023

Management Discussion and Analysis
Macroeconomic and Industry Developments
India’s GDP registered a growth of 7.2 per cent in Financial 
Year 2022-23 as per latest estimates by the Central Statistical 
Organisation. This is a moderation from 9.1 per cent growth 
in Financial Year 2021-22, largely due to the base effect for 
Financial Year 2021-22 owing to the negative economic impact 
of pandemic in Financial Year 2020-21. Growth was supported 
by pent up consumption demand and easing of supply – side 
constraints as the economy looked to shake off pandemic 
induced disruptions.
Private consumption continued to improve, registering a healthy 
growth of 7.5 per cent on strong discretionary spending. Urban 
demand showed resilience while rural demand began to show 
early signs of recovery. Investment momentum remained strong 
as private capex recovery began supported by rising Government 
capital expenditure. Exports expanded at a healthy rate of 13.6 
per cent in Financial Year 2022-23 crossing the $400 billion mark 
for the second year in a row. However, exports seemed to have 
lost some momentum towards the latter half of 2022-23 as global 
growth headwinds rose.

Financial Statements

On the positive side, there are supports for domestic growth 
as well. The Union Budget 2023-24 increased Government’s 
allocation on capital expenditure by 37.4 per cent to over 10 
lakh crore. Further, the rationalisation of income tax slabs 
announced in the Budget is likely to aid consumption demand 
by putting more money in the hands of people in the lower 
income brackets. Manufacturing and private capital expenditure 
may see improvement as inflation moderates supported by the 
pause in RBI’s rate hike cycle. Finally, the normal monsoon 
forecast by IMD augurs well for the agriculture sector. However, 
risk of El-Nino negatively affecting temporal and spatial rainfall 
distribution remains.
On balance, we expect India’s GDP growth at 6.0 per cent in 
2023-24. Headline inflation has moderated from its peak of 7.8 
per cent year-on-year in April 2022, with a cool off in commodity 
prices and food inflation as well as an improvement in supply 
chains. Headline inflation stood at 4.8 per cent year-on-year in 
June 2023. However, there are several risks on horizon. Uneven 
nature of monsoons, El-Nino risk and weak progress in Kharif 
sowing are some of major risks to inflation outlook. In 2023-2024, 
we estimate headline inflation to average at 5.1 per cent year-onyear. We expect the RBI to keep the policy rate unchanged at 
6.5 per cent throughout 2023-2024 and see possibility of rate 
cuts only in early 2024-2025. 
Overall, the Indian economy remained a bright spot even as 
geopolitical tensions, banking and financial sector volatility, 
historic inflationary highs and COVID-19 related disturbances 
affected much of the large economies. The global headwinds 
could cloud the economic outlook, but India’s domestic resilience 
as reflected over 2022-23 is likely to withstand future headwinds.
Financial Performance
The financial performance of your Bank during the year ended 
March 31, 2023, remained healthy with Total Net Revenue 
(Net Interest Income plus Other Income) rising 16.3 per cent 
to ` 118,057.1 crore from `101,519.5 crore in the previous year. 
Revenue growth was driven by an increase in both Net Interest 
Income and Other Income. Net Interest Income grew by 20.6 
per cent to ` 86,842.2 crore. Net Interest Margin (NIM) stood at 
4.1 per cent. Gross Advances grew by 16.9 per cent and 
Deposits grew by 20.8 per cent.
TOTAL NET REVENUE
16.3 per cent growth
Other Income grew by 5.8 per cent to ` 31,214.8 crore. The 
largest component was Fees and Commissions at ` 23,844.1 
crore. Within fees approximately 94 per cent pertains to Retail. 
The increase in fees is largely explained by increase in the Retail 
exposures. Loss on Revaluation and Sale of Investments was 
` 1,131.2 crore. Foreign Exchange and Derivatives Revenue was 
` 4,081.9 crore, and recoveries from written-off accounts were 
` 3,382.4 crore.
Operating (Non-Interest) Expenses rose to ` 47,652.1 crore 
from ` 37,442.2 crore. This is explained by setting up of 1,479 
new branches and 1,597 ATMs / Cash Deposit and Withdrawal 
Machines (CDMs). This, along with higher spend on IT, resulted in 
higher infrastructure and staffing expenses. Staff expenses also 
went up due to employee additions and annual wage revisions. 
Further, Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation 
(DICGC) premium cost increased due to deposit growth and 
rate increase. The Cost to Income Ratio was 40.4 per cent as 
compared to 36.9 per cent during the previous year owing to 
higher staff and infrastructure expenses

Business Review
Your Bank’s operations are split into Domestic and International.
A) Domestic Business comprises the following:
Retail Banking
Your Bank's Retail Assets are built on three key principles: 
Industry First Digital Offering, Optimal Pricing for Risk, and 
Pristine Portfolio Quality. By adhering to these principles, your 
Bank has achieved an impressive 22 per cent year-on-year 
growth in Domestic Retail Advances.
The Personal Loans segment has experienced strong growth, 
with the overall portfolio touching ` 171,676 crore by the end 
of the year. The Bank's increased focus on the Government 
segment and top corporates has contributed to improved 
portfolio quality.
The launch of Xpress car loans, offering seamless end-to-end 
digital disbursement, has driven a 17 per cent year-on-year 
growth in the Auto Loan portfolio.
Your Bank has exhibited significant growth in gold loans, 
surpassing other gold financiers, thanks to an expanded branch 
network. 
Home Loan portfolio has exhibited significant growth, surpassing 
industry growth rates and capturing a larger market share. 
Continued emphasis is placed on digitising processes and 
enhancing customer touchpoints to expand the Bank's reach. 
Building on the success of initiatives like Personal Loan in 10 
Seconds, Digital Loan Against Shares, and Digital Loan Against 
Mutual Funds, your Bank introduced in the year under review an 
industry-first, completely digital, contactless, and paperless car 
loan process. New customers can receive disbursement within 
30 minutes, including the Video KYC process, while existing 
pre-approved customers can obtain loan disbursement in just 10 
seconds. These loans are credited to the account of the dealer.
The payments business continues to play a pivotal role in driving 
balance sheet growth and is one of the stated strategic growth 
pillars for the Bank. 
With over 85 million cards issued (credit, debit and pre-paid) 
and a widely spread acceptance network across online and 
offline merchant ecosystem, the Bank continues to maintain 
a leadership position across multiple product offerings in the 
payments landscape. 
In Financial Year 2022-23, HDFC Bank introduced many new 
products across the payments business. 
Smart Hub Vyapar, an integrated holistic banking and business 
solution that caters to daily needs of merchants and helps 
drive business growth, was formally launched in October 2022. 
The platform has witnessed widespread adoption and has 
onboarded one million users across the country as of March 
31, 2023.
The Credit Cards business continued to enhance its product 
offerings and launched a slew of co-branded credit cards 
covering Retail and Wholesale business segments. Overall, the 
cards business (credit, debit and pre-paid) continued to see 
robust volume growth, with customer spends crossing ` 5 lakh 
crore in Financial Year 2022-23.
Further, the Bank launched PayZapp 2.0, a comprehensive 
mobile payment commerce app in March 2023. The app already 
has more than one million registrations. 
Lastly, in tune with the evolving payments landscape, the 
business continues to transform itself with significant investments 
across cloud computing, analytics, Artificial Intelligence and 
Machine Learning, open APIs and cyber security. The objective 
is to manage large scale and continuously grow volumes while 
processing transactions in a safe and secure manner.
Virtual Relationship Banking is an integrated customer centric 
approach covering three pillars - Virtual Relationship, Virtual 
Sales and Virtual Care. This channel is a crucial component of 
its sales and customer engagement strategy. It involves the use 
of technology to reach out to customers, build relationships, and 
promote banking products and services. This is an effective way 
for the Bank to expand the managed customer base, generate 
leads, and drive revenue growth.
Employees and customers are the capital for this business, and 
the Bank has invested heavily in training and development of its 
relationship managers. Training covers product knowledge, sales 
techniques, communication skills, compliance and regulatory 
requirements, and customer relationship management skills. 
A banking experience with digital ease and personalised 
conversations is at the core of our VRM strategy. Digital or 
contactless banking became a necessity during the pandemic.

This programme gained further traction in the year under review. 
Under VRM, relationship managers reach out to customers 
through remote and digital platforms resulting in deeper and 
cost-effective engagement. As digital literacy and exposure 
increases exponentially, VRMs are gaining wider acceptance 
through deeper engagement and relationships backed by a 
strong product offering and are an important component of the 
Bank's customer engagement strategy.
With proper training, technology support, and compliance 
adherence, this channel is a highly effective tool for the Bank to 
drive revenue growth, expand its customer base, and provide 
excellent customer service.
Meanwhile, your Bank also added 1,479 branches during the 
year, taking the total to 7,821. As of March 31, 2023, the Bank’s

distribution of insurance products, aimed at providing customers 
with a wide choice by leveraging the product bouquet of the 
three insurance partners. For the year ended March 31, 2023, 
the Bank mobilised premium of ` 8,689 crore representing a 
year-on-year growth of 28 per cent. The extensive distribution 
network, includes branches, virtual channels, NRI services, and 
wealth management. The key focus would continue to be on 
staff training, robust quality and control processes uniformly 
implemented across all partners as well as offering integrated 
and seamless digital on-boarding journeys. Currently, the Bank’s 
NetBanking platform offers more than 60 insurance products 
across all partners, accounting for over 53 per cent of the 
total policies. 
Non-Life Insurance
Your Bank, in collaboration with its three General Insurance and 
two Standalone Health and Insurance partners, has introduced 
innovative non-life insurance products to expand the range of 
offerings and provide a comprehensive coverage to customers. 
These products are accessible through both digital and physical 
platforms. Employees across channels have been trained in the 
new products and processes. To meet customer demands, 
additional manpower has been deployed across non-life 
insurers. As on March 31, 2023, premium mobilisation in General 
and Health Insurance reached a total of ` 2,405 crore.
Mutual Funds
Your Bank follows an open architecture approach in distribution 
of Mutual Funds and is currently associated with 34 Asset 
Management Companies (AMCs). The Bank’s Assets under 
Management (AUM) increased by 10 per cent to reach ` 1,01,655 
crore for the year ended March 31, 2023. During the same 
period, the Bank witnessed a significant growth of 40 per cent 
in Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) mobilisation. Through its 
unique Investment Services Account (ISA) offering, the Bank 
offers a digital on-boarding platform to the customers for Mutual 
Funds’ investments - 74 per cent of ISAs were opened through 
digital mediums in Financial Year 2022-23.

In financial year 2022-23, your Bank has focused on expansion 
and has reached 923 locations through the hub and spoke 
model. We now cater to over 62,000 households with a 51 per 
cent growth in customer base. Market share in mutual fund 
distribution now stands at 5 per cent. Your Bank’s endeavour is 
to continue this expansion into new geographies through a more 
granular approach.
Your Bank places a strong emphasis on a customer-centric 
approach. Our commitment to an open architecture and 
non-proprietary framework remains unwavering. The team of 
relationship managers, service relationship managers, and 
investment analysts work together to provide best-in-class

profitability of your Bank.
We remain focused on providing wealth management services

Wholesale Banking
The Wholesale Banking business was an important growth 
engine for your Bank in the year under review. This business 
focuses on institutional customers such as the Government, 
PSUs, large and emerging corporates, and SMEs. Your Bank’s 
strong offerings include working capital and term loans, as well 
as trade credit, cash management, supply chain financing, 
foreign exchange, and investment banking services.
The Wholesale Banking business recorded healthy growth, 
ending Financial Year 2022-23 with a domestic loan book size of 
` 823,254 crore, recording a growth of 11.6 per cent over the 
earlier year. This constituted about 52 per cent of your Bank’s 
domestic loans as per Basel II classification. Your Bank was 
able to expand its share of the customer wallet, primarily 
using sharper customization, cross-selling and expanding into 
more geographies. 
Corporate Banking, which focuses on large, well-rated companies, 
continued to be the biggest contributor to Wholesale Banking in 
terms of asset size. 
This business refocused on its engagement with MNCs. This 
business also continued to capitalise on the trend of large 
companies preferring to deal with fewer banks. Your Bank 
deepened its existing relationships as well as gained market 
share by leveraging its wide product offering. This business 
supported customer requirements under the Production Linked 
Incentive Scheme. The Emerging Corporates Group, which 
focuses on the mid- market segment, too witnessed significant 
growth. Your Bank leveraged its vast geographical reach, 
technology backbone, automated processes, suite of financial 
products and quick turnaround times to offer a differentiated 
service. The business continues to have a diversified portfolio 
in terms of both industry and geography.
In the year under review, the Bank continued its focus on the 
MSME sector. There has already been increased formalistion/ 
digitalisation of the MSME sector due to the adoption of the 
Goods and Service Tax (GST). The COVID-19 pandemic led 
to the sector experiencing substantial stress, prompting the 
Union Government to identify it for special support through 
various schemes like Moratorium, ECLGS, ECLGS Extension 
and COVID support loans. Your Bank supported its customers 
during this period by participating in the Government schemes 
and emerged as a star performer under the ECLGS scheme.
The Investment Banking business further cemented its 
prominent position in the Debt Capital Markets, Equity Capital 
Markets and INR Loan Syndication. Your Bank maintained its 
position amongst the top 3 in the Bloomberg rankings of Rupee 
Bond Book Runners for Financial Year 2022-23, with a market 
share of 16.54 per cent. Your Bank maintained its 2nd position 
in the Bloomberg rankings of Syndicated INR term loans for 
Financial Year 2022-23, with a market share of 6.38 per cent. 
Your Bank is actively assisting clients in equity fund raising and 
advisory services
In the Government business, your Bank sustained its focus on 
tax collections, collecting direct tax (CBDT) of ` 4,99,099.29 crore 
and Indirect tax (CBIC+ GST) of over ` 3,45,008.23 crore during 
Financial Year 2022-23. It continues to enjoy a pre-eminent position 
among the country’s major stock and commodity exchanges in 
both Cash Management Services and Cash Settlement Services.
The Bank has embarked on strategic digital transformation to 
enhance Customer Engagement and Employee Experience and 
create an ecosystem for seamless banking. 
The Bank is leveraging analytics for deeper insights on Corporate 
ecosystems leading to better product structuring, cross sell 
opportunities, improved yields, thus improving Bank’s share of 
Revenue Pools from Corporates.
In addition to the Corporate Net Banking platform (e-Net and 
the new upgraded platform CBX) and Trade Platform - Trade 
on Net (TON), the Bank has also launched the new SCF 
transaction platform which allows digital contract bookings and 
disbursements automating the SCF transactions end to end for

the Corporates. Multiple Corporates have already migrated to 
the platform. The Bank is also integrated with all the three TReDS 
platforms. We are also partnering with Fintechs to integrate 
with Corporate ERP and offer Embedded Banking in Corporate 
Ecosystems journeys. 
Treasury
The Treasury is the custodian of your Bank’s cash/liquid assets 
and handles its investments in securities, foreign exchange 
and cash instruments. It manages the liquidity and interest rate 
risks on the balance sheet and is also responsible for meeting 
reserve requirements. The vertical also helps manage the 
treasury needs of customers and earns a fee income generated 
from transactions customers undertake with your Bank while 
managing their foreign exchange and interest rate risks.
Revenue accrues from spreads on customer transactions based 
on trade and remittance flows and demonstrated hedging 
needs. Your Bank recorded revenue of 4,081.9 crore from foreign 
exchange and derivative transactions in the year under review. 
While plain vanilla forex products were in demand across all 
customer segments, demand for derivatives products increased 
with the RBI liberalizing regulations and allowing Indian banks to 
participate in Non-Deliverable Offshore markets.
As part of its prudent risk management, your Bank enters into 
foreign exchange and derivatives deals with counterparties after 
it has set up appropriate credit limits based on its evaluation of 
the ability of the counterparty to meet its obligations. Where 
your Bank enters into foreign currency derivatives contracts 
not involving the Indian Rupee with its customers, it typically 
lays them off in the inter-bank market on a matched basis. For 
such foreign currency derivatives, your Bank primarily carries 
the counterparty credit risk (where the customer has crystallised 
payables or mark-to-market losses) and may carry only residual 
market risk, if any. Your Bank also deals in derivatives on its own 
account, including for the purpose of its own Balance Sheet 
risk management.
Your bank is also a nominated agent for the bullion imports and 
has a significant market share in that business.
Your Bank maintains a portfolio of Government Securities in 
line with the regulatory norms governing the Statutory Liquidity 
Ratio (SLR). A significant portion of these SLR securities are in 
‘Held-to- Maturity’ (HTM) category, while some are ‘Available for 
Sale’ (AFS). Your Bank is also a primary dealer for Government 
Securities. As a part of this business, your Bank holds fixed 
income securities as ‘Held for Trading’ (HFT).
In the year under review, your Bank continued to be a significant 
participant in the domestic exchange and interest rate markets. It 
also capitalised on falling bond yields to book profits and is now 
looking at tapping opportunities arising out of the liberalisation 
in the foreign exchange and interest rate markets.
B) International Business
During the year, your Bank stayed on course to cater to NRI 
clients and deepen its product and service proposition. Your 
Bank has global footprints by way of representative offices and 
branches in countries like Bahrain, Hong Kong, the UAE and 
Kenya. It also has a presence in International Financial Service 
Centre (IFSC) at GIFT City in Gandhinagar, Gujarat.
The Bank’s product strategy in International Markets is customer 
centric and it has products to cater to client needs across asset 
classes. Your Bank now has plans to extend the product offering 
from GIFT City Branch under Liberalized Remittance Scheme to 
Resident and Non-Resident clients.
As on March 31, 2023, the Balance Sheet size of International 
Business was US$ 7.68 billion. Advances constituted 2.6 per cent 
of the Bank’s Gross Advances. The Total Income contributed 
by Overseas Branches constituted 1.2 per cent of Bank’s Total 
Income for the year.

C) Partnering with the Government
Government and Institutional Business
It has been another year of steady growth for the Government 
and Institutional business in your Bank. Some of the key 
highlights this year were:

the private sector banks for SNA (Single Nodal Agency) 
accounts as well as Centrally Sponsored Schemes 
including Jal Jeevan Mission, Atal Mission for Rejuvenation 
and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), Prime Minister Awas 
Yojana (PMAY), Swachh Bharat Mission, National Water 
Mission and Waste to Wealth Mission, among others. 
Processing about 36 per cent of the funds i.e. ` 6.5 lakh 
crore which flowed from the Central Government to the 
states for development programs under the aegis of the 
Centrally Sponsored Schemes, Central Sector Schemes, 
and the 15th Finance Commission. 
Being the leading agency bank with 34 per cent market 
share in direct tax collections, 14 per cent in GST and 13

D) Semi-Urban and Rural
The Semi-Urban and Rural (SURU) markets have always been 
a focus of your Bank’s strategy. In the last few years, your Bank 
has made a renewed push into these markets as rising income 
levels and aspirations of rural customers are leading to demand 
for better quality financial products and services. The rural 
groups in every department of your Bank work together to tap 
these opportunities.
Apart from meeting its statutory obligations under PSL (Agri and 
Allied activities, Small and Marginal Farmers and weaker sections 
etc.), your Bank has been offering a wide range of products on 
the asset side, such as Auto, Two-Wheeler, Personal, Gold, Light 
Commercial Vehicle (LCV), and small shopkeeper loans in these 
markets. Now it plans to increase its coverage of villages and 
deepen relationships in existing ones. The semi-urban and rural 
push has been backed by the Bank’s digital strategy.
Your Bank’s operations in Semi-Urban and Rural locations are 
explained below:
Agriculture and Allied Activities
Your Bank’s assets in Agriculture and Allied activities stood at 
` 2,55,300.17 crore as on March 31, 2023.
In general, the key to your Bank’s success in the existing market 
is its ability to tap the opportunities through:
• Wide product range
• Faster turnaround time
• Digital solutions
HDFC Bank’s product range includes pre and post harvest 
Crop Loans, Farm Development/Investment Loans, TwoWheeler Loans, Auto Loans, Tractor Loans, Small Agri Business 
Loans, Loan Against Gold, among others. This has helped the 
Bank establish a strong footprint in the rural hinterland with its 
asset products.
Your Bank has also been a leading participant in the Agri 
Infrastructure Fund scheme and has been achieving the allocated 
targets of the last few campaigns run by the Government.
Apart from advising farmers on their financial needs, your Bank 
is increasingly focusing on facilitating various Government/
Regulatory schemes and non-crop segment covering agri allied 
and small agri business enterprises including rural MSMEs.
Your Bank has designed a range of crop and geographyspecific products in line with the harvest cycles and the local 
needs of farmers across diverse Agro-climatic zones. It has 
transformed rural banking services from being product centric 
to customer centric.
Products such as post-harvest cash credit and warehouse 
receipt financing enable faster cash flows to farmers. Credit 
is also offered for allied agricultural activities such as dairy, 
pisciculture, and sericulture.
Participation in Government Schemes
As a part of Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan, the Government of 
India has announced several schemes/enablers across several 
sectors, particularly in the agriculture sector. Your Bank is 
implementing almost all such initiatives/schemes targeting 
multiple stakeholders in the agri ecosystem.
Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF) Scheme: Through 
this scheme the Bank is offering medium to long-term debt 
for investment in viable projects pertaining to post harvest 
management and infrastructure development like construction

Your Bank is actively implementing the scheme and passing 
the benefits to all eligible borrowers in the food processing 
sector. In the current financial year loans worth ` 205 crore have 
been sanctioned for 1,091 projects and ` 161 crore has been 
disbursed to 765 projects. 
Other Agri schemes include Agri Marketing Infrastructure 
Fund, Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Fund, Agri Clinic and 
Agribusiness Centres, Mission for Integrated Development of 
Horticulture (MIDH), Stand up India, Credit Guarantee Fund for 
Micro Units as well as state specific Government schemes.
To address high volume and low value ticket loans in AgriBusiness with a digital optimization strategy, your Bank plans 
to onboard AgriTech-BCs with differentiated business models. 
These AgriTechs will help source and service small and 
marginal farmers.
Funding Small and Marginal Farmers (SMFs)
Your Bank views lending to the agriculture sector, including to 
small and marginal farmers as a huge opportunity and not just a 
regulatory mandate to meet priority sector lending requirements. 
The Bank has leveraged its extensive knowledge of rural 
customers to create as well as deliver products and services 
at affordable price points and with quick turnaround time. This 
has enabled HDFC Bank to establish a strong footprint in the 
rural geographies, which it has now leveraged to increase its 
penetration of liability products. 
In the last financial year, your Bank serviced customers in 
165,000 villages. The rural banking teams have reached out to 
these villages with various suite of agriculture products. Your 
Bank is looking at growing the numbers in the coming year to 
200,000 plus villages with a plethora of interventions.
Further, your Bank has put in place a strategy to engage closely 
with small and marginal farmers through customised agriculture 
loans. It has launched various secured/unsecured loan products, 
including loan against gold as security targeting small and 
marginal farmers in agri and allied segment while leveraging the 
Government schemes.
Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs): For agriculture 
productivity and incomes to grow, aggregation of farm holdings 
in the form of FPOs is the key strategy in doubling farmers’ 
income. Leveraging the Government scheme for formation and 
promotion of 10,000 new FPOs (Credit guarantee is available 
from NABARD/CGTMSE), your Bank is funding eligible FPOs for 
working capital and term loan requirements. As on March 31, 
2023, your Bank was able to reach 118 FPOs covering 74,000 
small and marginal farmers.
Dairy
Dairy is the largest segment in the agriculture economy 
and keeping this in mind, your Bank has created a separate 
team of agriculture specialists to cater to this segment. In 
Financial Year 2022-23 the Bank has disbursed an amount of 
` 895.89 crore to 66,000 small and marginal farmers for Cattle 
finance. 
Digital Interventions
Digitising Milk Procurement: This initiative brings 
transparency in the milk procurement and payment process, 
which benefits both farmers and dairy societies. Multi-function 
Terminals (MFTs), popularly known as Milk-to- Money ATMs, are 
deployed in dairy societies. The MFTs link the milk procurement 
system of the dairy society to the farmer’s account to enable 
faster payments. MFTs have cash dispensers that function as 
standard ATMs. Payments are credited without the hassles of 
Directors’ Report

cash distribution. Further, this process creates a credit history 
which can then be used for accessing bank credit. Apart 
from dairy and cattle loans, customers gain access to all the 
Bank’s products including digital offerings such as 10 Second 
Personal Loans, Kisan Credit Card, Bill Pay, and Missed Call 
Mobile Recharge. So far, your Bank has digitised payments at 
over 1,700 milk cooperatives across 21 states, benefiting more 
than 5.9 lakh dairy farmers. The Dairy business witnessed 86 
per cent year-on-year growth in disbursements and 78 per cent 
in the book.
Substituting Moneylenders:
The Bank is strategically expanding its presence in a market 
that was previously dominated by unorganized sectors such as 
moneylenders and pawn brokers. A major goal of the Bank is to 
make the gold loan facility accessible across the entire country. 
In Financial Year 2022-23, the Bank successfully expanded its 
gold loan services to 2,827 additional branches, bringing the 
total number of branches offering this service to 4,189. At the 
end of the year, the Bank's gold loan portfolio amounted to 
` 11,026 crore.
The bank is implementing its blueprint for making gold loans 
available in most of its branches and thereby taking gold loan 
product to otherwise untapped customer segments.
Social initiatives in Farm Sector
Farm yield and income are subject to the vagaries of the 
weather. In addition, factors like soil health, input quality (seeds 
and fertilizers), water availability, and Government policy have 
significant impact, along with price realisations and storage 
facilities. Your Bank has launched a variety of initiatives to ease 
the stress on farm income and rural households.
Over the last few years, several parts of the country have 
been severely impacted by natural calamities such as drought, 
unseasonal rains, hailstorms, floods and the pandemic. Within 
regulatory guidelines, your Bank has been providing relief to the 
impacted farmers. It also has put in place systems designed to 
enable direct benefit transfers in a time-bound manner.
Lending to the agriculture sector, including to small and marginal 
farmers, is a regulatory mandate as part of priority sector lending 
requirements. The Bank has leveraged its extensive knowledge 
of rural customers to create as well as deliver products and 
services at affordable price points and with quick turnaround 
time. This has enabled the Bank to establish a strong footprint 
in the rural geographies, which it has now leveraged to increase 
its penetration of liability products. Further, your Bank is building 
a segment-specific approach like funding to horticulture clusters, 
supply chain finance, agri business, MSMEs and dairy farmers. 
It also continues to engage closely with farmers to mitigate risks 
and protect portfolio quality.
Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME)
The MSME sector serves as an important engine for economic 
growth and is one of the largest employers in the economy. As 
on March 31, 2023, your Bank’s assets in the MSME segment 
stood at ` 363,618 crore. The Micro Enterprises assets alone 
stood at ` 139,115 crore. 
The Union Government and the Reserve Bank of India 
(RBI) provided special support to the MSME sector during 
the pandemic through various schemes, such as Interest 
Moratorium, ECLGS, ECLGS extension, and COVID support 
loans. The Government has also launched a revamped CGTMSE 
scheme with increased limit threshold for guarantee cover and 
reduction of guarantee fee. 
Your bank emerged as the largest contributor to CGTMSE 
this year, supporting the MSME sector with guarantee-covered 
credit facilities. This has further supported the growth of MSME 
loans, which have shown a year-on-year growth of 22.5 per cent. 
The Bank also supported its customers through the ECLGS 
and ECLGS extension schemes this year and provided ad hoc 
enhancements as needed. HDFC Bank continued to be a star 
performer under the ECLGS 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and ECLGS extension 
schemes. It disbursed loans amounting to ` 44,823 crore to 
over 1.25 lakh customers under these schemes. The Bank 
continued to provide swift support to existing customers after the 
Government announced the extension of the ECLGS scheme.
The pace of digitalisation among MSMEs has accelerated, which 
has helped to speed up the pace of disbursement and increase 
transparency in the sector. Customers can now apply online and 
submit required documents digitally, and they can also execute 
post-sanction agreements digitally to avail of facilities quickly with 
straight-through disbursement. The Government's digitalisation 
push, the adoption of GST, and reforms in return filings, such 
as income tax, have made it easier to access customer cash 
flow and financial data, which can be used to support decisionmaking and portfolio monitoring.
The SME portal continues to offer ad hoc approvals and preapproved Temporary Overdrafts (TODs) on a Straight Through 
Processing (STP) basis to existing customers. They can request 
a top-up of loans and submit the required documents online. The 
SME portal also allows customers to access your Bank's services 
related to sanctioned credit facilities 24/7 from anywhere. We 
have also enabled customers to download various certificates 
and statements as needed on an ongoing basis.
On the trade side, your Bank focuses on customer engagement 
to increase the penetration of Trade on Net applications. Trade 
on Net is a complete enterprise trade solution for customers 
engaged in domestic and foreign trade. It enables them to initiate 
and track requests online seamlessly, reducing time and costs.

Directors’ Report

65 lakh transactions and has seen 1.5X increase in the 
average spend.
SmartHub Vyapar: The one-stop business and banking 
solution designed and developed to serve the business 
needs of Micro and Small Enterprises (MSMEs) is being 
continuously enhanced with new use cases bundled 
as part of various rollouts. The latest rollout included 
on-boarding for select segments of Savings Account 
customers, a General Purpose Reloadable (GPR) prepaid card wherein, the merchant as a customer can apply 
and load money and other app linked enhancements. The 
continuous enhancements over time have aided in scaling 
up to reach 1.5 million merchants. The app handles over 
18 lakh transactions daily and has earned a 4.9 average 
rating on Play Store and 4.6 on App Store. Besides, 
SmartHub has facilitated the disbursement of over 
` 10,000 crore worth of loans.
Onboarding and Servicing Journeys: We have 
accelerated our digitisation agenda after carrying ahead 
the momentum from the previous years in truly digitising 
our customer journeys. The Onboarding Journeys 
enable smoother and consistent customer experience 
by expanding the offerings on the Bank’s platforms. 
A few of the onboarding journeys added are New to Bank 
Credit Cards, Existing to Bank Credit Cards without offer, Gold 
Loan and SmartHub lead form and Sovereign Gold Bond. 
In addition to the above our Servicing Journeys such 
as Debit Card hot listing and re-issue, Nomination/Email 
updation, etc have also been rolled out. Journeys such 
as Individual Current Account, Business Loan for Existing 
and New to Bank customers without offer are in their final 
stages before launch.
HDFC Bank One (Customer Experience Hub), the

20 per cent of our total car loans are now being 
facilitated through XCL.
Disbursal takes less than 30 minutes.
Our Digital Distribution Platform was launched in 
April, 2023. With this platform, we have digitally enabled 
our network of Corporate Business Correspondents and 
Business Facilitators by providing them an omnichannel 
experience for the digital journeys of products such 
as Gold Loan, Home Loans, Kisan Gold Card, Sales 
Accounts, Recurring Deposits, Fixed Deposits, etc. which 
are focusing specifically on rural locations. This portal has 
been made available for agents as well as partners.
Cattle Finance: Dairy Cattle Finance app, our onetouch solution is developed to facilitate dairy farmers by 
providing them with a single platform for an end-to-end 
digital processing of their applications. Beginning with 
onboarding, the platform encompasses everything till 
disbursement leading to a significant reduction in the 
turnaround-time thus enhancing customer experience. 
Since its public launch in December, 2022, Cattle Finance 
has processed over 2,700 applications. This journey was 
conceptualised, documented, designed, developed, and 
launched all within a mere 30 days showcasing our Bank’s

reaching this record number within the span of a 
year.
UPI: HDFC Bank’s UPI has continued to move from 
strength to strength with a substantial year-on-year 
growth both in value as well as volumes. Now, with 
the successful implementation of the Active-Active 
architecture of UPI we can process records from 
National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) 
DR and its’ PR site simultaneously. This will play 
a significant role in laying the foundation for our 
HDFC Bank UPI Active-Active design. Efforts on UPI 
mandates at the launch time of the LIC IPO proved 
fruitful as HDFC Bank was selected for the main IPO 
among the top 5 banks. UPI will be enhanced further 
with the introduction of UPI Lite with its first issuer 
scheduled to go-live across the country. 
FynDNA Governor Solution: Governor Solution 
is our recently developed adaptive rate limiter 
deployed between the source and destination 
system (whether Cloud or On-premises), which plays 
the key role of intelligently managing and controlling 
the exchange of transactions basis the health of 
the destination system. This monitoring mechanism 
allows for detailed analysis of the performance of 
the destination system, enabling detection of any 
irregularities and avoiding performance deterioration. 
ATM Hard Disk Encryption: With the 
implementation of Full Hard Disk Encryption, the 
Bank has further fortified the security structures 
at our ATMs, mitigating the risk of an attack on the 
machine posed by system booting through a USB/
CD or DVD. Currently, over 12,000 ATMs’ have been 
encrypted with additional encryption plans for the 
remaining already in place.
SDWAN: Software-Defined Wide Area Network has 
been rolled out across over 2,000 locations enabling 
the management of network devices through 
software as opposed to the traditional usage of 
hardware switches, routers, etc. It assists in creation 
of a centralised control centre thereby improving 
performance and reliability for users.
Directors’ Report

implement "Bank Tokenization" in addition to 
"Network Tokenization" facilitating enablement of 
On-us transactions resulting in huge savings. 
ATM hard disk encryption - Our ATMs are being 
further secured by Hard Disk Encryption. It has 
already been carried out in over 9,000 ATMs with 
the remaining still in progress. 
Cyber Security
Cyber security is at the heart of the technology transformation 
journey with substantial advancements being made to further 
fortify the Bank’s infrastructure and applications. Few initiatives 
in this regard are:
Foundation of a next-gen Security Operations Centre 
(SOC) with advanced technologies for predictive security 
and incident management. To this effect, the Bank has 
provisioned the Securonix platform on AWS and 
configured more than 10,000 logging sources and devices 
for monitoring. The Bank has upgraded its monitoring and 
detection by deploying next generation security incident 
event management solution (SIEM) fueled by artificial 
intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) capabilities 
along with its strong UEBA (User Entity Behavioural 
Analysis) functionalities and inbuilt threat modelling. This 
initiative and approach to leverage AI and ML as an entire 
suite to proactively detect and respond to threats is seen 
as the first in the industry.
Introduction of Security Orchestration, Automation and 
Response (SOAR) to reduce the incident response time 
by connecting security solutions with each other and 
automating the incident life cycle.
Micro-segmentation is being enabled in the data centre 
network to allow higher visibility across network flows as 
well as stronger preparedness and management against 
ransomware related events / incidents.
24x7 defacement monitoring and vulnerability 
management of the Bank’s internet properties minimise 
the surface area for cyber security attacks.
Technology related challenges over the past few years have 
only made the Bank’s resolve stronger to consolidate and fortify 
its technology environment. Focused technology and digital 
investments and programs in technology are pivotal to the Bank 
to usher in the new age of digital banking and experiences for 
its customers.
Service Quality Initiatives and Grievance Redressal
Customer Focus is one of the five core values deeply ingrained 
in the ethos of your Bank. With a holistic approach, your 
Bank continuously strives to enhance customer experience, 
recognising the significance of this in a highly competitive 
business environment, especially with diverse lines of 
businesses. Ensuring exceptional product quality and service 
delivery becomes paramount for sustained growth. Your Bank 
desires to achieve this by seeking customer feedback as well as 
benchmarking with best-in-class business entities and facilitating 
the implementation of customer-centric improvements. Your 
Bank has adopted a three-step strategy with regards to 
Customer Service - Define, Measure, and Improve.
Your Bank has adopted a multi-pronged approach to provide 
an omnichannel experience to its customers. On one side, your 
Bank has traditional touch points like Branch, Email Management 
team and PhoneBanking, and on the other side, it has state- ofthe-art platforms like NetBanking, MobileBanking, the chatbot 
Eva and the bank’s exclusive social care handles which offer a 
wide range of channel choice to its customers. Your Bank has 
also improvised on the relationship-based banking programmes 
by introducing a Virtual Relationship Manager (VRM) programme 
to cater to various financial needs in a personalised manner. 
Customer service performance and grievance redressal are 
regularly assessed at different levels, including Branch Level 
Customer Service Committees (BLCSCs), Standing Committee 
on Customer Service (SCCS) and Customer Service Committee 
of the Board (CSCB). Your Bank has implemented robust 
processes to monitor and measure service quality levels across 
touchpoints, including at product and process level, through 
diligent work of the Quality Initiatives Group.
The Service Quality team conducts regular reviews across 
various products, processes and channels, focusing on 
improving the customer experience. A unique Service Quality 
Index (SQI) has been developed to measure the performance of 
key customer facing channels based on critical customer service 
parameters. This SQI enables continuous improvement initiatives 
to raise service standards. The effectiveness of the quality of 
service provided is also extensively reviewed, including at the 
Customer Service Committee of the Board. 
One of the basic building blocks of providing acceptable level 
of customer service is to have an effective internal Grievance 
Redressal Mechanism / Framework. Your Bank has developed 
a comprehensive Grievance Redressal Policy, duly approved by 
the Board, which outlines a framework for resolving customer 
grievances. This policy is accessible to customers through the 
Bank’s website and branch network.
Your Bank actively participated in RBI’s Nationwide Intensive 
Customer Awareness campaign, aiming to enhance customer 
awareness on their rights and responsibilities in context of the 
customer service standards and the Internal Grievance Redress 
(IGR) provided by the Regulated Entities and Alternate Grievance 
Redress (AGR) mechanism of RBI. The initiative emphasised to

customers about the self-protection measures for safeguarding 
against the growing incidents of digital and electronic financial 
frauds, reaching even the farthest and remotest areas of 
the country.
Your Bank has created multiple channels for customers to provide 
feedback and register grievances, facilitating a transparent and 
accessible system. As a pioneer in innovative financial solutions 
and digital platforms, your Bank has witnessed an increased 
utilisation of its digital channels, resulting in improved customer 
loyalty. Keeping customer interest in focus, your Bank has 
formulated a Board approved Protection Policy, which limits 
the liability of customers in case of unauthorised electronic 
banking transactions.
Your Bank is on a journey to measure customer loyalty through 
a high velocity, closed loop customer feedback system. This 
customer experience transformation programme will help 
employees empathise better with customers and improve 
turnaround times. Branded as ‘Infinite Smiles’, the programme 
would help establish behaviours and practices that result in 
customer-centric actions through continuous improvements in 
product, services, process, and policies.
Your Bank remains committed to placing the customer at the 
centre of its operations. By consistently improving customer 
experience, adopting an omnichannel approach, and 
implementing robust service quality and grievance redressal 
mechanisms, your Bank aims to exceed customer expectations 
and build lasting relationships.
Risk Management and Portfolio Quality
Your Bank's historical focus on Pillar 1 risks, including Credit 
Risk, Market Risk, and Operational Risk, has been expanded 
in response to the evolving banking landscape. Liquidity Risk, 
Information Technology Risk, and Information Security Risk 
have also emerged as critical considerations. These risks not 
only impact your Bank's financial strength and operations but 
also its reputation. To address these concerns, your Bank 
has established Board-approved risk strategy and policies 
overseen by the Risk Policy and Monitoring Committee (RPMC). 
The Committee ensures that frameworks are established for 
assessing and managing various risks faced by your Bank, 
systems are developed to relate risk to the Bank’s capital level 
and methods are in place for monitoring compliance with internal 
risk management policies and processes. The Committee 
guides the development of policies, procedures and systems 
for managing risks. It ensures that these are adequate and 
appropriate to changing business conditions, the structure and 
needs of your Bank and its risk appetite.
The hallmark of your Bank’s risk management function is that it 
is independent of the business sourcing unit with convergence 
only at the CEO level.
The gamut of key risks faced by the Bank which are dimensioned 
and managed include:
Credit Risk, including Residual Risks
Market Risk
Operational Risk
Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book
Liquidity Risk
Intraday Liquidity Risk
Intraday Credit Risk
Credit Concentration Risk
Counterparty Credit Risk
Model Risk
Outsourcing Risk
People Risk
Business Risk
Strategic Risk
Compliance Risk
Reputation Risk

Group Risk
Credit Risk
Credit Risk is the possibility of losses associated with diminution 
in the credit quality of borrowers or counterparties. Losses 
stem from outright default or reduction in portfolio value. Your 
Bank has a comprehensive credit risk architecture, policies, 
procedures, and systems for managing credit risk in its retail 
and wholesale businesses. Wholesale lending is managed on 
an individual as well as portfolio basis. In contrast, given the 
granularity of individual exposures, retail lending is managed 
largely on a portfolio basis across various products and customer 
segments. Robust front-end and back-end systems are in 
place to ensure credit quality and minimise default losses. The 
factors considered while sanctioning retail loans include income, 
demographics, credit history, loan tenure, and banking behavior. 
In addition, multiple credit risk models are developed and used 
to assess different segments of customers based on portfolio 
behavior. In wholesale loans, credit risk is managed by capping 
exposures based on borrower group, industry, credit rating 
Directors’ Report

grades, and country, among others. This is backed by portfolio 
diversification, stringent credit approval processes, periodic 
post-disbursement monitoring, and remedial measures. Your 
Bank has ensured strong asset quality through volatile times 
in the lending environment by stringently adhering to prudent 
norms and institutionalised processes. Your Bank also has a 
robust framework for assessing Counterparty Banks, which are 
reviewed periodically to ensure interbank exposures are within 
approved appetite.
As on March 31, 2023, your Bank’s ratio of Gross Non-Performing 
Assets (GNPAs) to Gross Advances was 1.12 per cent. Net NonPerforming Assets (Gross Non-Performing Assets Less Specific 
Loan Loss provisions) was 0.27 per cent of Net Advances.
Your Bank has a conservative and prudent policy for specific 
provisions on NPAs. Its provision for NPAs is higher than the 
minimum regulatory requirements and adheres to the regulatory 
norms for Standard Assets.
Digital and Credit Risk
Driven by rapid technological advancements, the banking 
sector is witnessing the increasing importance of digitalisation 
as a critical differentiator for customer retention and service 
delivery. Digital lending has emerged as a convenient and quick 
method for customers to secure loans with just a few clicks, 
often in minutes, if not seconds. However, addressing the risks 
associated with digital lending is crucial, and your Bank has 
implemented appropriate measures to manage these risks 
effectively. Digital loans are sanctioned primarily to your Bank’s 
existing customers. Often, they are customers across multiple 
products, thus enabling the Bank ready access to their credit 
history and risk profile. This accessibility facilitates the evaluation 
of their loan eligibility. Moreover, the credit checks and scores 
used by your Bank in process based underwriting are replicated 
for digital loans. This ensures consistency in the evaluation 
process. To further enhance risk management, your Bank has 
established an independent model validation unit responsible for 
assessing the credit scoring models utilised in generating credit 
scores for digital loans. These models are subject to ongoing 
monitoring, periodic reviews, back-testing, and corrective 
actions are implemented whenever necessary.
By implementing these measures, your Bank aims to balance the 
convenience and speed of digital lending with associated risks.
Market Risk
Market Risk arises primarily from your Bank's statutory reserve 
management and trading activity in interest rates, equity, and 
currency market. These risks are managed through a well-defined 
Board approved Market Risk Policy, Investment Policy, Foreign 
Exchange Trading Policy, and Derivatives Policy that caps risk in 
different trading desks or various securities through trading risk 
limits/triggers. The risk measures include position limits, tenor 
restrictions, sensitivity limits, namely, PV01, Modified Duration 
of Hold to Maturity Portfolio and Option Greeks, Value-at-Risk 
(VaR) Limit, Stop Loss Trigger Level (SLTL), Scenario-based P&L 
Triggers, Potential Loss Trigger Level (PLTL), and are monitored on 
an end-of-day basis. In addition, forex open positions, currency 
option delta, and interest rate sensitivity limits are computed 
and monitored on an intraday basis. This is supplemented by 
a Board-approved stress testing policy and framework that 
simulates various market risk scenarios to measure losses and 
initiate remedial measures. Your Bank's Market Risk capital 
charge is computed daily using the Standardised Measurement 
Method applying the regulatory factors.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank may not be able to 
meet its financial obligations as they fall due without incurring 
unacceptable losses. Your Bank's liquidity and interest rate risk 
management framework is spelled out through a well-defined 
Board approved Asset Liability Management Policy. As part of 
this process, your Bank has established various Board-approved 
limits for liquidity and interest rate risks in the banking book. 
The Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) is a decision-making unit 
responsible for implementing the liquidity and interest rate risk 
management strategy of the Bank in line with its risk management 
objectives and ensures adherence to the risk tolerance/limits set 
by the Board. ALCO reviews the policy's implementation and 
monitoring of limits. While the maturity gap, Basel III ratios, and 
stock ratio limits help manage liquidity risk, Net Interest Income 
and market value impacts help mitigate interest rate risk in the 
banking book. This is reinforced by a comprehensive Boardapproved stress testing programme covering both liquidity and 
interest rate risk.
Your Bank conducts various studies to assess the behavioural 
pattern of non-contractual assets and liabilities and embedded 
options available to customers, which are used while managing 
maturity gaps and repricing risk. Further, your Bank has the 
necessary framework to manage intraday liquidity risk.
The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) is one of the Basel 
Committee’s key reforms to develop a more resilient banking 
sector. The LCR, a global standard, is also used to measure your 
Bank’s liquidity position. LCR seeks to ensure that the Bank has 
an adequate stock of unencumbered High-Quality Liquid Assets 
(HQLA) that can be converted into cash easily and immediately 
to meet its liquidity needs under a 30-day calendar liquidity 
stress scenario. The LCR helps in improving the banking sector’s 
ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic 
stress, whatever the source, thus reducing the risk of spill over 
from the financial sector to the real economy. Based on Basel 
III norms, your Bank’s average LCR stood at 115.51 per cent on

regulatory threshold at 100 per cent.
AVERAGE LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO
115.51 per cent
ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS FOR FY 2022-23
The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), a key liquidity risk measure 
under BCBS liquidity standards, is also used to measure your 
Bank’s liquidity position. The NSFR seeks to ensure that 
your Bank maintains a stable funding profile in relation to the 
composition of its assets and off-balance sheet activities. The 
NSFR promotes resilience over a longer-term time horizon by 
requiring banks to fund their activities with more stable sources 
of funding on an ongoing basis. The RBI guidelines stipulated a 
minimum NSFR requirement of 100 per cent at a consolidated 
level and your Bank has maintained the NSFR well above 100 
per cent since its implementation. Based on guidelines issued 
by RBI, your Bank’s NSFR stood at 119.13 per cent on a 
consolidated basis at March 31, 2023.
Operational Risk
This is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal 
processes, people and systems or from external events. It also 
includes risk of loss due to legal risk.
Given below is a detailed explanation under four different 
heads: Framework and Process, Internal Control, Information 
Technology and Information Security Practices and Fraud 
Monitoring and Control.
A. Framework and Process
To manage Operational Risks, your Bank has in place a 
comprehensive Operational Risk Management Framework, 
whose implementation is supervised by the Operational Risk 
Management Committee (ORMC) and reviewed by the RPMC 
of the Board. An independent Operational Risk Management 
Department (ORMD) implements the framework. Under the 
framework, the Bank has three lines of defence. The first line of 
defence is the business line (including support and operations).
The first line is primarily responsible for developing risk mitigation 
strategies in managing operational risk for their respective units.
The second line of defence is the ORMD, which is responsible 
for implementing the operational risk management framework 
across the Bank. It designs and develops tools required for 
implementing the framework including policies and processes, 
guidelines towards implementation and maintenance of the 
framework. In order to achieve the aforesaid objective pertaining 
to operational risk management framework, the ORMC guides 
and oversees the functioning, implementation, and maintenance 
of operational risk management activities of Bank, with special 
focus on:
Identification and assessment of risks across the Bank 
through the Risk and Control Self-Assessment (RCSA) 
and Scenario analysis
Measurement of Operational Risk based on the actual 
loss data
Monitoring of risk through Key Risk Indicators (KRI)
Management and reporting through KRI, RCSA and loss 
data of the Bank
Internal Audit is the third line of defence. The team reviews the 
effectiveness of governance, risk management and internal 
controls within your Bank.
Internal Control
Your Bank has implemented sound internal control practices 
across all processes, units and functions. It has well laid down 
policies and processes for the management of its day-today activities. Your Bank follows established, well-designed 
controls, which include traditional four eye principles, effective 
segregation of business and support functions, segregation of 
duties, call back processes, reconciliation, exception reporting 
and periodic MIS. Specialised risk control units function in riskprone products/ functions to minimise operational risk. Controls 
are tested as part of the SOX control testing framework.
Information Technology and Information Security 
Practices
Your Bank operates in a highly automated environment and makes 
use of the latest technologies available on cloud or on Premises 
Data centres to support various business segments. With advent 
of new technology tools and increased sophistication, Bank has 
improved its efficiency, reduced operational complexities, aided 
decision making and enhanced the accessibility of products and 
services. This results in various risks such as those associated 
with the use, ownership, operation, redundancy, involvement, 
influence, and adoption of IT within an enterprise, as well as 
business disruption due to technological failures. Additionally, 
it can lead to risks related to information assets, data security, 
integrity, reliability and availability, among others. Your Bank 
has put in place a governance framework, information security 
practices, business continuity plan, Disaster Recovery (DR) 
resiliency, Security Enhancements, Public Cloud and Cloud 
native services adoption and Enhanced Automated Monitoring 
mechanisms to mitigate Information Technology and Information 
Security-related risks. 
The three lines of defence approach is adopted for enterprisewide Technology Risk management. The first line of defence 
Directors’ Report
Directors’ Report

holds primary responsibility of managing the risk and ensuring 
proper controls are in place.
The second line of defence defines policies, frameworks and 
controls. Information Technology Risk function and Information 
Security Group addresses technology and information security 
related risks. A well-documented Board-approved information 
security policy and cyber security policy are in place. 
Your Bank has a robust Business Continuity and Disaster 
Recovery plan that is periodically tested to ensure that it can 
meet any operational contingencies. Further, there is a welldocumented crisis management plan in place to address the 
strategic issues of a crisis impacting the Bank and to direct and 
communicate the corporate response to the crisis including cyber 
crisis. In addition, employees periodically undergo mandatory 
business continuity awareness training and sensitisation 
exercises on a periodic basis.
For details on business continuity and crisis management 
measures, please refer page no. 64.
For details on robust cyber security measures, please 
refer page no. 62.
An independent assurance team within Internal Audit acts as a 
third line of defence that provides assurance on the management 
of IT-related risks.
Fraud Monitoring and Control
Your Bank has put in place a Whistle Blower and Vigilance Policy 
and a central vigilance team that oversees the implementation 
of fraud prevention measures. Frauds are investigated to identify 
the root cause and relevant corrective steps are recommended 
to prevent recurrence.
Fraud Monitoring committees at the senior management and 
Board level also deliberate on high value fraud events and advise 
preventive actions. Periodic reports are submitted to the Board 
and senior management committees.
Compliance Risk
Compliance Risk is defined as the risk of impairment of your 
Bank’s integrity, leading to damage to its reputation, legal or 
regulatory sanctions, or financial loss, as a result of a failure (or 
perceived failure) to comply with applicable laws, regulations, 
and standards. Your Bank has a Compliance Policy to ensure 
the highest standards of compliance. A dedicated team of 
subject matter experts in the Compliance Department works 
with business, support and operations teams to ensure active 
Compliance Risk management and monitoring. The team also 
provides advisory services on regulatory matters. The focus is on 
identifying and reducing risk by rigorously testing products and 
also putting in place robust internal policies. Products that adhere 
to regulatory norms are tested after rollout and shortcomings, 
if any, are fully addressed till the product stabilises. Internal 
policies are reviewed and updated periodically as per agreed 
frequency or based on market actions or regulatory guidelines/
actions. The compliance team also seeks regular feedback on 
regulatory compliance from product, business and operation 
teams through self-certifications and monitoring.
ICAAP
Your Bank has a structured management framework in the 
Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) to 
identify, assess and manage all risks that may have a material 
adverse impact on its business/financial position/capital 
adequacy. The ICAAP framework is guided by the Board 
approved ICAAP Policy.
Stress Testing Framework
Your Bank has implemented a Board approved Stress Testing 
Policy and Framework which forms an integral part of the Bank’s 
ICAAP. Stress testing involves the use of various techniques 
to assess your Bank’s potential vulnerability to extreme but 
plausible stressed business conditions. The changes in the 
levels of Pillar I risks and select Pillar II risks, along with the 
changes in the on and off-Balance Sheet positions of your Bank 
are assessed under assumed ‘stress’ scenarios and sensitivity 
factors. The suite of stress scenarios include topical themes 
as well as historically observed geopolitical / macroeconomic 
/ sectoral and other trends. The stress testing outcome may 
be analysed through capital impact and/or identification of 
vulnerable borrowers depending on the scenario.
Group Risk
Your Bank has two subsidiaries, HDB Financial Services Limited 
and HDFC Securities Limited. The Board of each subsidiary is 
responsible for managing their respective material risks (Credit 
Risk, Concentration Risk, Market Risk, Operational Risk, 
Liquidity Risk, Interest Rate Risk on Banking Book, Technology 
Risk, Reputation Risk, Compliance Risk, Business Risk and 
others). The Group Risk Management Committee (GRMC) 
was instituted in your Bank under the ICAAP framework to 
establish a formal and dedicated structure to periodically assess 
the nature/ quantum of material risks of the subsidiaries and 
adequacy of its risk management processes. Stress testing for 
the group as a whole is carried out by integrating the stress 
tests of the subsidiaries. Similarly, capital adequacy projections 
are formulated for the group after incorporating the business/
capital plans of the subsidiaries.
Business Continuity Planning (BCP)
Your Bank has a robust BCP program in place that enabled 
it to continue to operate and deliver quality services during 
COVID and beyond. Our ISO22301:2019 certified Business 
Continuity Program enables us to minimize service disruptions

regulatory bodies and is subject to regular internal, external, and 
regulatory reviews. The central Business Continuity Office works 
towards strengthening the Bank’s continuity preparedness. The 
implementation of the program is overseen by the Business 
Continuity Steering Committee which is chaired by the Chief 
Risk Officer. The Business Continuity Procedure has well 
defined roles and responsibilities for teams involved in Crisis

to continue delivering services seamlessly to customers through 
the disruptive events and beyond. 
Internal Controls, Audit and Compliance
Your Bank has put in place extensive internal controls and 
processes to mitigate Operational Risks, including centralised 
operations and ‘segregation of duty’ between the front office 
and back office. The front-office units usually act as customer 
touchpoints and sales and service outlets while the back-office 
carries out the entire processing, accounting and settlement 
of transactions in the Bank’s core banking system. The policy 
framework, definition and monitoring of limits is carried out by 
various mid-office and risk management functions. The credit 
sanctioning and debt management units are also segregated 
and do not have any sales and operations responsibilities.
Your Bank has set up various executive-level committees, with 
participation from various business and control functions, that 
are designed to review and oversee matters pertaining to capital, 
assets and liabilities, business practices and customer service, 
operational risk, information security, business continuity planning 
and internal risk-based supervision among others. The second 
line of defence functions set standards and lay down policies 
and procedures by which the business functions manage risks, 
including compliance with applicable laws, compliance 
with regulatory guidelines, adherence to operational 
controls and relevant standards of conduct. At the 
ground level, your Bank has a mix of preventive and 
detective controls implemented through systems and 
processes, ensuring a robust framework in your Bank to 
enable correct and complete accounting, identification 
of outliers (if any) by the Management on a timely basis 
for corrective action and mitigating operational risks.
Your Bank has put in place various preventive controls:
Limited and need-based access to systems 
by users
Dual custody over cash and near-cash items
Segregation of duty in processing of transactions 
vis-à-vis creation of user IDs
Segregation of duty in processing of transactions 
vis-à-vis monitoring and review of transactions/
reconciliation
Four eye principle (maker-checker control) for 
processing of transactions
Stringent password policy
Booking of transactions in core banking system 
mandates the earmarking of line/limit (fund as well 
as non-fund based) assigned to the customer
STP processes between core banking system 
and payment interface systems for transmission 
of messages
Additional authorisation leg in payment interface 
systems in applicable cases
Audit logs directly extracted from systems
Empowerment grid
Your Bank also has detective controls in place:
(a) 
Periodic review of user IDs
(b) 
Post-transaction monitoring at the back-end 
by way of call back process (through daily 
log reports) by an independent person, i.e., 
to ascertain that entries in the core banking 
system/messages in payment interface 
systems are based on valid/authorised 
transactions and customer requests
(i) 
Daily tally of cash and near-cash items at 
end of day
Directors’ Report

(ii) 
Reconciliation of Nostro accounts (by an 
independent team) to ascertain and match-off 
the Nostro credits and debits (External or Internal) 
regularly to avoid / identify any unreconciled/
unmatched entries passing through the system
(c) 
Reconciliation of all Suspense Accounts and 
establishment of responsibility in case of outstanding
(d) 
Independent and surprise checks periodically 
by supervisors.
Your Bank has an Internal Audit Department which is responsible 
for independently evaluating the adequacy and effectiveness of 
all internal controls, risk management, governance systems and 
processes and is manned by appropriately qualified personnel.
This department adopts a risk-based audit approach and carries 
out audits across various businesses i.e., Retail, Wholesale and 
Treasury (for India and Overseas books), audit of Operations units, 
Management and Thematic audits, Information Security audit, 
Revenue audit and Concurrent audit in order to independently 
evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls on 
an ongoing basis and proactively recommending enhancements 
thereof. The Internal Audit Department, during the course of audit, 
also ascertains the extent of adherence to regulatory guidelines, 
legal requirements and operational processes and provides 
timely feedback to the Management for corrective actions. A 
strong oversight on the operations is also kept through off-site 
monitoring by use of data analytics to study trends/patterns to 
detect outliers (if any) and alert the Management.
The Internal Audit Department also independently reviews 
your Bank’s implementation of Internal Rating Based (IRB)- 
approach for calculation of capital charge for Credit Risk, the 
appropriateness of your Bank’s ICAAP, as well as evaluates the 
quality and comprehensiveness of your Bank’s disaster recovery 
and business continuity plans and also carries out management 
self-assessment of adequacy of the Bank’s internal financial 
controls and operating effectiveness of such controls in terms of 
Sarbanes Oxley (SOX) Act and Companies Act, 2013. The Internal 
Audit Department plays an important role in strengthening of the 
Control functions by periodically reviewing their practices and 
processes as well as recommending enhancements thereof. 
Additionally, oversight is also kept on the functioning of the 
subsidiaries, related party transactions and extent of adherence 
to the licensing conditions of the RBI.
Any new product/process introduced in your Bank is reviewed by 
Compliance function in order to ensure adherence to regulatory 
guidelines and also by Internal Audit from the perspective of 
existence of internal controls. The Audit function also proactively 
recommends improvements in operational processes and 
service quality, wherever deemed fit.
To ensure independence, the Internal Audit Function has a 
reporting line to the Audit Committee of the Board and a dotted line 
reporting to the Managing Director for administrative purposes.
The Compliance function independently tracks, reviews and 
ensures compliance with regulatory guidelines and promotes a 
compliance culture in the Bank.
Your Bank has a comprehensive Know Your Customer, 
Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Combating Financing of 
Terrorism (CFT) policy (based on the RBI guidelines/provisions 
of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002) incorporating 
the key elements of Customer Acceptance Policy, Customer 
Identification Procedures, Risk Management and Monitoring of 
Transactions. The policy is subjected to an annual review and is 
duly approved by the Board.
Your Bank besides having robust controls in place to ensure 
adherence to the KYC guidelines at the time of account opening 
also has monitoring process at various stages of the customer 
lifecycle including a continuous review process in the form of 
transaction monitoring carried out by a dedicated AML CFT 
monitoring team, which carries out transaction reviews for 
identification of suspicious patterns/trends that enables your 
Bank to further carry out enhanced due diligence (wherever 
required) and appropriate actions thereafter. 
The Audit team and the Compliance team undergo regular 
training both in-house and external to equip them with the 
necessary knowhow and expertise to carry out the function.
The Audit Committee of the Board reviews the effectiveness 
of controls, compliance with regulatory guidelines as also the 
performance of the Audit and Compliance functions in your Bank 
and provides direction, wherever deemed fit. Your Bank has 
always adhered to the highest standards of compliance and

low in June 2022 as the US Fed stepped up monetary tightening

Board Performance Evaluation
The performance evaluation of the Board, Committees of the

Chairman) for Financial Year 2022-23, was carried out internally 
pursuant to the framework laid down by the Nomination and 
Remuneration Committee ('NRC'). A questionnaire for the 
evaluation of the Board, its Committees and the individual 
members of the Board (including the Chairman), designed 
in accordance with the said framework and covering various 
aspects of the performance of the Board and its Committees, 
including composition, roles and responsibilities, Board 
processes, Boardroom culture, adherence to Code of 
Conduct and Ethics, quality and flow of information, as well as 
measurement of performance in the areas of strength and areas 
of focus, as identified in the previous year's evaluation, was sent 
out to the Directors. The Committees were evaluated inter alia 
on parameters such as composition, terms of reference, quality 
of discussions, contribution to Board decisions and balance of 
agenda between the Committee and the Board. The responses 
received to the questionnaires on evaluation of the Board and its 
Committees were placed before the meeting of the Independent 
Directors for consideration. The assessment of performance of 
Non-Independent Directors on key personal and professional 
attributes was also carried out at the meeting of Independent 
Directors. The assessment of performance of the Independent 
Directors on the Board (including Chairman) was subsequently 
discussed by the Board. In addition to the above parameters, 
the Board also evaluated fulfillment of the independence 
criteria as specified in SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirement) Regulations, 2015 by the Independent Directors of 
the Bank and their independence from the management.
The evaluation brought out the cohesiveness of the Board, a 
Boardroom culture of trust and cooperation, and Boardroom 
discussions which are open, transparent and encourage diverse 
viewpoints. Other areas of strength included effective discharge 
of Board's roles and responsibilities. Some of the areas of focus 
for the Board going forward included continue to adhere to 
the best governance practices, increasing time dedicated to 
strategy- competitive positioning and benchmark, long term 
succession planning and talent management, improvement in 
Board processes and quality of information. The Board also 
noted that while there has been positive development in the 
areas of focus identified in the previous year's evaluation, efforts 
need to continue in that direction. The appropriate feedback 
was conveyed to the Board members and other concerned 
stakeholders, for suitable action.

proper criteria for Directors of the Bank. The Policy lays down 
the criteria for identification of persons who are qualified an 
‘fit and proper’ to become Directors on the Board- such as 
academic qualifications, competence, track record, integrity, etc. 
which shall be considered by the NRC while recommending 
appointment of Directors. The Policy is available on the website 
of the Bank at the link https://www.hdfcbank.com/personal/

Directors’ Report

The remuneration of all employees of the Bank, including Whole 
Time Directors, Material Risk Takers, Key Managerial Personnel,

culture based on the belief that the Performance Management

holistically. The compensation system should also take into 
account factors such as roles, skills / competencies, experience 
and grade / seniority to differentiate pay appropriately on the 
basis of contribution, skill and availability of talent on account 
of competitive market forces. The details of the Compensation 
Policy are also included in Note No. 24 of Schedule 18 forming 
part of the Accounts.

expertise at the Board level are continuously reviewed and

business and assurance functions, is continuously reviewed to 
ensure continuity and depth of leadership at two levels below the

Management positions falling vacant, to ensure a smooth and 
seamless transition.

reviewed by the NRC and the Board.

Conclusion
The last financial year was when the world began living again 
as it largely came out of the COVID 19 induced disruptions. The 
Indian economy demonstrated considerable resilience and is 
expected to be the fastest growing major economy in the world 
despite global headwinds and geopolitical tensions. 
Your Bank has a huge opportunity thanks to the under 
penetration of banking services in India. It has a strong balance 
sheet in terms of both size and asset quality. Its consistent 
performance and customer focus has helped it build a franchise 
that can capitalise on the opportunity. The merger with HDFC 
Limited is a positive for its long term growth story with the 
addition of the home loan product to its portfolio opening up 
a significant runway. It will continue focusing on its five core 
values: Customer Focus, Operational Excellence, Product 
Leadership, People and Sustainability and adhering to high 
levels of corporate governance.

To the Members of HDFC Bank Limited
Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Opinion 
We have audited the accompanying Standalone Financial Statements of HDFC Bank Limited (“the Bank”), which comprise 
the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, and the Profit and Loss Account and the Cash Flow Statement for the year then 
ended, and notes to the Standalone Financial Statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid Standalone 
Financial Statements give the information required by the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 as well as the Companies Act, 2013 
(“the Act”) in the manner so required for banking companies and are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted 
in India and give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Bank as at March 31, 2023, and its profit and its cash flows 
for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our 
responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Standalone 
Financial Statements” section of our report. We are independent of the Bank in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
Standalone Financial Statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we 
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
Key Audit Matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We 
have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.
Independent Auditor's Report

Identification and Provisioning of Non-performing Advances (NPA):
Total NPA as at March 31, 2023: `18,011.85 Crores 
Provision for NPA as at March 31, 2023: `13,643.71 Crores 
(Refer Schedule 17 (C)(2), Schedule 18 note 12)
Key Audit Matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
The Bank is required to comply with the Master Circular dated 
April 01, 2022 issued by the Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) on “Prudential 
Norms on Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning 
pertaining to Advances” (the “IRAC norms”) and amendments thereto, 
which prescribe the guidelines for identification and classification of 
Non-performing Advances and the minimum provision required for 
such assets. 
The Bank is also required to apply its judgement to determine the 
identification and provision required against Non-performing Advances 
considering various quantitative as well as qualitative factors.
The identification of Non-performing Advances is also affected by 
factors like stress and liquidity concerns in certain sectors.
The provision for identified Non-performing Advances is estimated 
based on ageing and classification of Non-performing Advances, 
nature of product, value of security etc. and is also subject to the 
minimum provisioning norms specified by RBI.
Since the identification of Non-performing Advances and provisioning 
for Non- performing Advances requires considerable level of 
management estimation, application of various regulatory requirements 
and its significance to the overall audit, we have identified this as a key 
audit matter.
Our audit procedures included the following:
- Understood the process and controls, and tested the design and 
operating effectiveness of key controls, including Information 
Technology based controls, and focused on the following:
• Monitoring of credit quality which amongst other things includes 
the monitoring of overdue loan accounts, drawing power limit, 
pending security creation;
• Identification and classification of Non- performing Advances in 
accordance with IRAC norms, other regulatory guidelines issued 
by the RBI and consideration of qualitative aspects; and
• Testing of application controls including testing of automated 
controls, reports and system reconciliations.
- Evaluated the governance process and controls over calculations 
of provision for Non-performing Advances and tested that basis of 
provisioning is in accordance with the Board approved policy and 
IRAC norms.
- Tested the controls for identification of loans with default events and 
/ or breach of key covenant, and for a sample of performing loans, 
independently assessed as to whether there was a need to classify 
such loans as Non-performing Advances.
- On a test check basis, verified the accounts classified by the Bank 
as Special Mention Accounts (‘SMA’) in RBI’s Central Repository of 
Information on Large Credits (‘CRILC’).
With respect to provisions recognised towards Non-performing 
Advances, we reperformed the provision calculations on a sample basis 
taking into consideration the value of security, where applicable, the 
IRAC norms and the policy of the Bank, and compared our outcome to 
that prepared by the management and tested relevant assumptions and 
judgements which were used by the management.

Information Technology (“IT”) Systems and Controls impacting Financial Reporting
Key Audit Matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
The IT environment of the Bank is complex and involves a large number 
of independent and interdependent IT systems used in the operations 
of the Bank for processing and recording a large volume of transactions. 
As a result, there is a high degree of reliance and dependency on such 
IT systems for the financial reporting process of the Bank. 
Appropriate IT general controls and IT application controls are required 
to ensure that such IT systems are able to process the data as required, 
completely, accurately, and consistently for reliable financial reporting.
We have identified certain key IT systems (“in-scope” IT systems) which 
have an impact on the financial reporting process and the related 
control testing as a key audit matter because of the high level of 
automation, significant number of systems being used by the Bank for 
processing financial transactions, the complexity of the IT architecture 
and its impact on the financial records and financial reporting process 
of the Bank.
 
Our procedures with respect to this matter included the following:
In assessing the controls over the IT systems of the Bank, we 
involved our technology specialists to obtain an understanding of the 
IT environment, IT infrastructure and IT systems. We evaluated and 
tested relevant IT general controls over the “in-scope” IT systems and 
IT dependencies identified as relevant for our audit of the standalone 
financial statements and financial reporting process of the Bank. On 
such “in-scope” IT systems, we have tested key IT general controls with 
respect to the following domains:
• Program change management, which includes that program 
changes are moved to the production environment as per defined 
procedures and relevant segregation of environment is ensured. 
• User access management, which includes user access provisioning, 
de-provisioning, access review, password management, sensitive 
access rights and segregation of duties to ensure that privilege access 
to applications, operating systems and databases in the production 
environment were granted only to authorized personnel. 
• Program development, which includes controls over IT application 
development or implementation and related infrastructure, which are 
relied upon for financial reporting.
• IT operations, which includes job scheduling, monitoring and backup 
and recovery.
We also evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness 
of relevant key IT dependencies within the key business process, 
which included testing automated controls, automated calculations / 
accounting procedures, interfaces, segregation of duties and system 
generated reports, as applicable. 
We communicated with those charged with governance and 
management and tested a combination of compensating controls or 
remediated controls and / or performed alternative audit procedures, 
where necessary.
Other Information
The Bank’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included 
in the annual report but does not include the Standalone Financial Statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The annual 
report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor's report.
 
Our opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any form 
of assurance conclusion thereon.
 
In connection with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified 
above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the 
Standalone Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
 
When we read the annual report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate 
the matter to those charged with governance and take appropriate action as applicable under the relevant laws and regulations.
Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the Standalone Financial 
Statements
The Bank’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act, with respect to the preparation 
of these Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance and 
cash flows of the Bank in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Accounting 
Standards specified under Section 133 of the Act, and the provisions of Section 29 of the Banking Regulations Act, 1949 

and circulars, guidelines and directions issued by the Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) from time to time. This responsibility also 
includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the 
assets of the Bank and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate 
accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness 
of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Standalone Financial Statements that give a true 
and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, management is responsible for assessing the Bank’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless management and Board of Director either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so. The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Bank’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect 
a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these Standalone Financial Statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout 
the audit. We also:
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or 
error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is 
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, 
or the override of internal control.
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 
in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether 
the Bank has adequate internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements in place and the 
operating effectiveness of such controls.
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by management of the Bank.
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the 
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant 
doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are 
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the Standalone Financial Statements or, if 
such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up 
to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a 
going concern.
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Standalone Financial Statements, including the disclosures, 
and whether the Standalone Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation.
10. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the 
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
11. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought 
to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

12. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We 
describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, 
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse

Independent Auditor's Report
Annexure A to the Independent Auditor’s Report 
Referred to in paragraph 16(f) of the Independent Auditor’s Report of even date to the members of HDFC Bank Limited on the 
standalone financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 
Report on the Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements under 
clause (i) of sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Act
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements of HDFC Bank Limited (“the 
Bank”) as of March 31, 2023, in conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial statements of the Bank for the year 
ended on that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The Bank’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control 
over financial reporting criteria established by the Bank considering the essential components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (“the Guidance Note”) issued by the Institute 
of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, 
including adherence to Banks’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the 
accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required 
under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Banks's internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial 
Statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing 
deemed to be prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, 
both applicable to an audit of internal financial controls and both issued by the ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note 
require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements was established and maintained and 
if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system 
with reference to Standalone Financial Statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with 
reference to Standalone Financial Statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference 
to Standalone Financial Statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design 
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s 
judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether 
due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on 
the Banks’s internal financial controls system with reference to Standalone Financial Statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With reference to Financial Statements
A Bank's internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements is a process designed to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Standalone Financial Statements 
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Bank's internal financial controls with 
reference to Standalone Financial Statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of 
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Bank; (2) 
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of Standalone Financial 
Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Bank are 
being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the Bank; and (3) provide reasonable 

assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the Bank's assets that 
could have a material effect on the Standalone Financial Statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls With reference to financial statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements, including 
the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may 
occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone 
Financial Statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone 
Financial Statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the 
policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Bank has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system with reference to Standalone 
Financial statements and such internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements were operating 
effectively as at March 31, 2023, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Bank 
considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued by ICAI.

Schedule 17 - Significant accounting policies 
appended to and forming part of the financial 
statements for the year ended March 31, 2023
BACKGROUND
HDFC Bank Limited (‘HDFC Bank’ or ‘the Bank’), 
incorporated in Mumbai, India is a publicly held banking 
company engaged in providing a range of banking and 
financial services including retail banking, wholesale 
banking and treasury operations. The Bank is governed 
by the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and the Companies 
Act, 2013. The Bank has overseas branch operations in 
Bahrain, Hong Kong, Dubai and Offshore Banking Unit at 
International Financial Service Centre (IFSC), GIFT City, 
India. The financial accounting systems of the Bank are 
centralised and, therefore, accounting returns are not 
required to be submitted by branches of the Bank.
BASIS OF PREPARATION
The standalone financial statements have been prepared 
and presented under the historical cost convention and 
accrual basis of accounting, unless otherwise stated and 
are in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting 
Principles in India (‘GAAP’), statutory requirements 
prescribed under the Third Schedule of the Banking 
Regulation Act, 1949, directions, circulars and guidelines 
issued by the Reserve Bank of India (‘RBI’) from time to 
time (RBI guidelines), Accounting Standards (‘AS’) specified 
under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read 
together with the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 and 
the Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2021, in so 
far as they apply to banks.
 
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity 
with GAAP requires the management to make estimates 
and necessary assumptions in the reported amounts of 
assets and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) as 
of the date of the financial statements and the reported 
income and expenses for the reporting year. Management 
believes that the estimates used in the preparation of the 
financial statements are prudent and reasonable. Actual 
results could differ from these estimates. Any revision in 
the accounting estimates is recognised prospectively in the 
current and future periods.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Investments
 
Classification: 
In accordance with the RBI guidelines, investments are 
classified on the date of purchase into “Held for Trading” 
(‘HFT’), “Available for Sale” (‘AFS’) and “Held to Maturity” 
(‘HTM’) categories (hereinafter called “categories”). 
Subsequent shifting amongst the categories is done 
in accordance with the RBI guidelines. Under each of 
these categories, investments are further classified under 
six groups (hereinafter called “groups”) - Government 
Securities, Other Approved Securities, Shares, Debentures 
and Bonds, Investments in Subsidiaries / Joint Ventures 
and Other Investments. 
Purchase and sale transactions in securities are accounted 
on settlement date except in the case of equity shares 
which are accounted on trade date.
Basis of classification:
Investments that are held for resale within 90 days from 
the date of purchase are classified under HFT category. 
Investments which the Bank intends to hold till maturity are 
classified under HTM category. Investments in the equity 
of subsidiaries / joint ventures are classified under HTM 
category. Investments which are not classified in either of 
the above categories are classified under AFS category.
Acquisition cost: 
Brokerage, commission, etc. and broken period interest 
on debt instruments are recognised in the Profit and Loss 
Account and are not included in the cost of acquisition.
Disposal of investments:
Profit / Loss on sale of investments under the aforesaid 
three categories is recognised in the Profit and Loss 
Account. Cost of investments is determined based on the 
weighted average cost method. The profit from sale of 
investment under HTM category, net of taxes and transfer 
to statutory reserve is appropriated from the Profit and Loss 
Account to “Capital Reserve”.
Short sale:
The Bank undertakes short sale transactions in Central 
Government dated securities in accordance with the RBI 
guidelines. The short position is categorised under HFT 
category and netted off from investments. The short 
position is marked to market and loss, if any, is charged to 
the Profit and Loss Account while gain, if any, is ignored. 
Profit / Loss on short sale is recognised on settlement date.
Valuation:
Investments classified under AFS and HFT categories 
are marked to market individually and depreciation / 
appreciation is aggregated for each group. Net depreciation, 
if any, compared to the acquisition cost, in any of the six 
groups, is charged to the Profit and Loss Account. The net 
appreciation, if any, in any of the six groups is not recognised 
except to the extent of depreciation provided earlier. The 
Schedules to the Financial Statements
As at March 31, 2023

book value of individual securities is not changed on such 
revaluation of investments.
Traded investments are valued based on the trades / 
quotes on the recognised stock exchanges or prices 
published by Financial Benchmarks India Pvt Ltd. 
(FBIL) with Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives 
Association (FIMMDA) as the calculating agent. Investments 
denominated in foreign currencies are valued based on the 
prices provided by market information providers such as 
Bloomberg, Refinitiv, etc.
The market value of unquoted government of India securities, 
state government securities and special bonds such as oil 
bonds, fertilizer bonds etc. issued by the government of 
India is computed as per the prices published by FBIL with 
FIMMDA as the calculating agent. 
The valuation of other unquoted fixed income securities (viz. 
other approved securities and bonds and debentures), and 
preference shares, is done with appropriate mark-up, i.e. 
applicable FIMMDA published credit spread over the Yield 
to Maturity (YTM) rates for government of India securities as 
published by FBIL with FIMMDA as the calculating agent.
Unquoted equity shares are valued at the break-up 
value, if the latest Balance Sheet is available or at ` 1 for 
each company.
Units of mutual funds are valued at the latest net asset value 
declared by the respective schemes of the mutual fund. 
Treasury bills, commercial papers and certificate of deposits 
being discounted instruments, are valued at carrying cost. 
Investments in Security receipts (SR) and unquoted 
units of Infrastructure Investment Trust (InvIT) are valued 
as per the net asset value provided by the issuing Asset 
Reconstruction Company and InvIT trust respectively. 
Investments in unquoted units of Alternative Investment 
Fund (AIF) are categorised, at the discretion of the Bank, 
under HTM category for an initial period of three years and 
valued at cost during this period. Such investments are 
transferred to the AFS category after the said period of 
three years. Investments in AFS category are valued at 
NAV shown by the AIF in its financial statements. Units are 
valued based on the latest audited financials of the AIF, if 
available, or at ` 1 per AIF as per the RBI guidelines.
Pass Through Certificates (PTC) including Priority SectorPTCs are valued by using FIMMDA credit spread as 
applicable for the NBFC category, based on the credit rating 
of the respective PTC over the YTM rates for government 
of India securities published by FBIL with FIMMDA as the 
calculating agent. 
Investments classified under HTM category are carried 
at their acquisition cost and not marked to market. Any 
premium on acquisition is amortised over the remaining 
maturity period of the security on a constant yield-tomaturity basis. Such amortisation of premium is adjusted 
against interest income from investments. Any diminution, 
other than temporary, in the value of investments in HTM 
category is provided for.
Non-performing investments are identified and provision 
are made thereon based on the RBI guidelines. The 
provision on such non-performing investments is not set 
off against the appreciation in respect of other performing 
investments. Interest on non-performing investments is not 
recognised until received.
Repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions:
Repurchase (Repo) and reverse repurchase (Reverse 
Repo) transactions are reflected as borrowing and lending 
transactions respectively. 
Borrowing cost on repo transactions is accounted as 
interest expense and revenue on reverse repo transactions 
is accounted as interest income.

Advances
Classification:
Advances are classified as performing and non-performing 
based on the RBI guidelines and are stated net of bills 
rediscounted, inter-bank participation with risk, specific 
loan loss provision, interest in suspense for non-performing 
advances, claims received from Credit Guarantors, 
provision for funded interest term loan and provision for 
diminution in the fair value of restructured assets. 
Provisioning:
The Bank classifies its loans and investments, including 
at overseas branches and overdues from crystallised 
derivative contracts, into performing and non-performing 
in accordance with RBI guidelines. Further the NPAs are 
classified into sub-standard, doubtful and loss assets 
based on the RBI guidelines. Non-performing assets are 
upgraded into standard as per the extant RBI guidelines.
Specific loan loss provision in respect of non-performing 
advances is made based on management’s assessment 
of the degree of impairment of advances, subject to the 
minimum provisioning prescribed by the RBI. 
The specific provision for retail non-performing advances 
is also made based on the nature of product and 
delinquency levels. 
Specific loan loss provision in respect of non-performing 
advances is included under Provisions and Contingencies.

Non-performing advances are written-off in accordance 
with the Bank’s policy. Recoveries from bad debts writtenoff are included under other income. 
In relation to derivative contracts with non-performing 
borrowers, the Bank makes provision for the entire amount 
of overdue and future receivables relating to positive 
marked to market value of the said derivative contracts.
The Bank maintains general provision for standard assets 
including credit exposures computed as per the current 
marked to market values of interest rate and foreign 
exchange derivative contracts and gold. The Bank also 
maintains general provision for unhedged foreign currency 
exposures of borrowers as prescribed by RBI. In the case 
of overseas branches, general provision on standard assets 
is maintained at the higher of the levels stipulated by the 
respective overseas regulator or RBI. The provision for 
standard assets is included under other liabilities.
In addition to the above, the Bank on a prudent basis 
makes provision on advances or exposures which are not 
NPAs,but has reasons to believe on the basis of the extant 
environment or specific information or basis regulatory 
guidance / instructions, of a possible slippage of a specific 
advance or a group of advances or exposures or potential 
exposures. These are classified as contingent provisions 
and included under other liabilities.
Provision made in addition to the Bank’s policy for specific 
loan loss provision for non-performing assets, possible 
slippage of specific exposures and regulatory general 
provision is categorised as floating provision. Creation of 
floating provision is considered by the Bank up to a level 
approved by the Board of Directors. Floating provisions 
are used only for contingencies under extraordinary 
circumstances and for making specific provisions for nonperforming accounts. Floating provisions are included 
under other liabilities.
Further to the provisions required to be held according 
to the asset classification status, provision is held for 
individual country exposures (other than for home country 
exposure). Countries are categorised into risk categories 
as per Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd. 
(‘ECGC’) guidelines and provisioning is made in respect of 
that country where the net funded exposure is one percent 
or more of the Bank’s total assets. Provision for country risk 
is included under other liabilities.
In accordance with the RBI guidelines on the prudential 
framework for resolution of stressed assets and the 
resolution frameworks for COVID-19 related stress and 
its Board approved policy, the Bank has implemented 
resolution plans for eligible borrowers. The asset 
classification and necessary provision thereon is made in 
accordance with the said RBI guidelines. The restructured 
loans are upgraded into standard category as per the 
extant RBI guidelines.

Securitisation and transfer of assets
Assets transferred through securitisation and direct 
assignment of cash flows are de-recognised in the Balance 
Sheet when they are sold (true sale criteria being fully met 
with) and consideration is received. Sales / transfers that do 
not meet true sale criteria are accounted for as borrowings. 
For a securitisation or direct assignment transaction, the 
Bank recognises profit upon receipt of the funds and loss 
is recognised at the time of sale.
On sale of stressed assets, if the sale is at a price below 
the net book value (i.e., funded outstanding less specific 
provisions held), the shortfall is charged to the Profit and 
Loss Account and if the sale is for a value higher than the 
net book value, the excess provision is credited to the 
Profit and Loss Account in the year when the sum of cash 
received by way of initial consideration and / or redemption 
or transfer of security receipts issued by SC / RC exceeds 
the net book value of the loan at the time of transfer.
In respect of stressed assets sold under an asset 
securitisation, where the investment by the bank in security 
receipts (SRs) issued against the assets transferred by it is 
more than 10 percent of such SRs, provisions held against 
outstanding SRs are higher of the provisions required in 
terms of net asset value declared by the Securitisation 
Company (‘SC’) / Reconstruction Company (‘RC’) and 
provisions as per the extant norms applicable to the 
underlying loans, notionally treating the book value of these 
SRs as the corresponding stressed loans assuming the 
loans remained in the books of the Bank.
The Bank invests in Pass Through Certificates (PTCs) issued 
by Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs). These are accounted 
at acquisition cost and are classified as investments. The 
Bank also buys loans through the direct assignment route 
which are classified as advances. These are carried at 
acquisition cost unless it is more than the face value, in 
which case the premium is amortised based on effective 
interest rate method.
The Bank transfers advances through inter-bank 
participation with and without risk. In the case of participation 
with risk, the aggregate amount of the participation issued 
by the Bank is reduced from advances. In case where 
the Bank is assuming risk by participation, the aggregate 
amount of the participation is classified under advances. 
In the case of issue of participation certificate without 
risk, the aggregate amount of participation issued by the 
Schedules to the Financial Statements
As at March 31, 2023

Bank is classified under borrowings and where the Bank 
is acquiring participation certificate, the aggregate amount 
of participation acquired is shown as due from banks 
under advances.

Fixed assets and depreciation
Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation as adjusted for impairment, if any. Cost 
includes cost of purchase and all expenditure like site 
preparation, installation costs and professional fees 
incurred on the asset before it is ready to use. Subsequent 
expenditure incurred on assets put to use is capitalised only 
when it increases the future benefit / functioning capability 
from / of such assets. 
Depreciation is charged over the estimated useful life of 
the fixed asset on a straight-line basis. The management 
believes that the useful life of assets assessed by the 
Bank, pursuant to Part C of Schedule II to the Companies 
Act, 2013, taking into account changes in environment, 
changes in technology, the utility and efficacy of the asset 
in use, fairly reflects its estimate of useful lives of the fixed 
assets. The estimated useful lives of key fixed assets are 
given below:

period of 4 years.
For assets purchased and sold during the year, 
depreciation is provided on pro-rata basis.
Whenever there is a revision of the estimated useful 
life of an asset, the unamortised depreciable amount 
is charged over the revised remaining useful life of the 
said asset.
Profit on sale of immovable property net of taxes 
and transfer to statutory reserve, are transferred to 
capital reserve.
Assets (other than PoS terminals) costing less than 
` 5,000 individually, are fully depreciated in the year 
of purchase.

Impairment of assets
The Bank assesses at each Balance Sheet date whether 
there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. 
Impairment loss, if any, is provided to the extent the 
carrying amount of assets exceeds their estimated 
recoverable amount.

Translation of foreign currency items
Foreign currency income and expenditure items of domestic 
operations are translated at the exchange rates prevailing 
on the date of the transaction. Income and expenditure 
items of integral foreign operations (representative offices) 
are translated at the weekly average closing rates and 
of non-integral foreign operations (foreign branches and 
offshore banking units) at the monthly average closing rates.
Outstanding foreign currency monetary items of domestic 
and integral foreign operations are translated at the closing 
exchange rates notified by Foreign Exchange Dealers’ 
Association of India (FEDAI) as at the Balance Sheet date 
and the resulting net revaluation profit or loss is recognised 
in the Profit and Loss Account.
Both monetary and non-monetary foreign currency 
assets and liabilities of non-integral foreign operations 
are translated at closing exchange rates notified by FEDAI 
at the Balance Sheet date and the resulting profit / loss 
arising from exchange differences are accumulated in the 
Foreign Currency Translation Reserve until disposal of the 
non-integral foreign operations in accordance with AS-11, 
The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates and the 
extant RBI guidelines. 
Foreign currency denominated contingent liabilities on 
account of foreign exchange and derivative contracts, 
guarantees, letters of credit, acceptances and 
endorsements are translated at closing rates of exchange 
notified by FEDAI as at the Balance Sheet date.

Foreign exchange and derivative contracts
Foreign exchange spot and forward contracts, outstanding 
as at the Balance Sheet date and held for trading, are 
revalued at the closing spot and forward rates respectively 
as notified by FEDAI and at interpolated rates for contracts 
of interim maturities. The USD-INR exchange rate for

valuation of contracts having longer maturities i.e. greater 
than one year, is derived using the USD-INR spot rate as 
well as relevant INR yield curve and USD yield curve. For 
other currency pairs, and non-deliverable contracts, the 
forward points (for rates / tenors not published by FEDAI) 
are obtained / derived basis data published by Refinitiv 
or Bloomberg for valuation of the contracts. Valuation is 
considered on present value basis. For this purpose, the 
forward profit or loss on the contracts are discounted to the 
valuation date using the discounting yields. The resulting 
profit or loss on valuation is recognised in the Profit and 
Loss Account. Marked to market value of foreign exchange 
contracts are classified as assets when the fair value is 
positive or as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
Foreign exchange forward contracts not intended for 
trading, that are entered into to establish the amount of 
reporting currency required or available at the settlement 
date of a transaction, and are outstanding at the Balance 
Sheet date, are effectively valued at the closing spot rate. 
The premium or discount arising at the inception of such 
forward exchange contract is amortised on a straight line 
basis as expense or income over the life of the contract. 
The Bank recognises all derivative contracts at fair value, 
on the date on which such derivative contracts are entered 
into and are re-measured at fair value as at the Balance 
Sheet date. Marked to market values of such derivatives 
are classified as assets when the fair value is positive or as 
liabilities when the fair value is negative.
The Bank as part of its risk management strategy, makes 
use of derivative instruments, including foreign exchange 
forward contracts, for hedging the risk embedded in 
some of its financial assets or liabilities recognised on the 
balance sheet. The Bank identifies the hedged item (asset 
or liability) at the inception of the transaction itself. Hedge 
effectiveness is ascertained at the time of the inception of 
the hedge and at the reporting date thereafter.
In case of a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of 
the hedging instruments and hedged items are recognised 
in the Profit and Loss Account and in case of cash flow 
hedges, the changes in fair value of effective portion are 
recognised in Reserves and Surplus under ‘Cash flow 
hedge reserve’ and ineffective portion of an effective 
hedging relationship, if any, is recognised in the Profit 
and Loss Account. The accumulated balance in the cash 
flow hedge reserve, in an effective hedging relationship, is 
recycled in the Profit and Loss Account at the same time 
that the impact from the hedged item is recognised in the 
Profit and Loss Account.

Revenue recognition
Interest income is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account 
on an accrual basis, except in the case of non-performing 
assets and overdue interest on retail EMI based performing 
advances, which are recognised when realised. In case 
of domestic advances, where interest is collected on rear 
end basis, such interest is accounted on receipt basis in 
accordance with the RBI communication.
Interest income on investments in PTCs and loans bought 
out through the direct assignment route is recognised at 
their effective interest rate. 
Income on non-coupon bearing discounted instruments is 
recognised over the tenor of the instrument on a constant 
yield basis.
Dividend on equity shares and preference shares is 
recognised as income when the right to receive the 
dividend is established.
Income from units of mutual funds / AIF is recognised on 
cash basis.
Loan processing fee is recognised as income when due. 
Syndication / Arranger fee is recognised as income when 
a significant act / milestone is completed.
Gain / loss on sell down of loans is recognised in line with 
the extant RBI guidelines.
Guarantee commission, commission on letter of credit, 
annual locker rent fees and annual fees for credit cards 
are recognised on a straight-line basis over the period 
of contract. Other fees and commission income are 
recognised when due, where the Bank is reasonably 
certain of ultimate collection.
Fees paid / received for priority sector lending certificates 
(PSLC) is recognised on straight-line basis over the period 
of the certificate.

Employee benefits
 
Stock based Employee Compensation:
The Employee Stock Option Scheme (‘the Scheme’) 
provides for the grant of options to acquire equity shares 
of the Bank to its employees and whole time directors. 
The Employee Stock Incentive Master Scheme -2022 
(ESIS-2022) provides for the grant of Restricted Stock 
Units (RSUs) to acquire equity shares of the Bank to its 
employees and whole-time directors. The options / units 
granted shall vest as per their vesting schedule and these 
may be exercised within a specified period. 
The Bank follows the intrinsic value method to account for 
its stock-based employee compensation plans in respect of 
options granted up to March 31, 2021. Compensation cost 
Schedules to the Financial Statements
As at March 31, 2023

is measured by the excess, if any, of the market price of 
the underlying stock over the exercise price as determined 
under the option plan. The market price is the closing 
price on the stock exchange where there is highest trading 
volume on the working day immediately preceding the date 
of grant. 
Effective April 01, 2021, the fair value of share-linked 
instruments on the date of grant for all instruments granted 
after March 31, 2021 is recognised as an expense in 
accordance with the RBI guidelines on Compensation of 
Whole Time Directors / Chief Executive Officers / Material 
Risk Takers and Control Function staff. The fair value of the 
stock-based employee compensation is estimated on the 
date of grant using Black-Scholes model. 
The compensation cost is amortised on a straight-line 
basis over the vesting period after adjusting estimated 
forfeiture. Ultimately, the cost for all instruments that vest 
is recognized. The compensation expense is recognised in 
the Profit and Loss Account with a corresponding credit to 
Employee Stock Options Reserve. On exercise of the stock 
options, corresponding balance in Employee Stock Options 
Reserve is transferred to Share Premium. In respect of the 
options which expire unexercised, the balance standing to 
the credit of Employee Stock Options Reserve is transferred 
to General Reserve.
Gratuity:
The Bank has an obligation towards gratuity, a defined 
benefit retirement plan covering all eligible employees. 
The plan benefit vests upon completion of five years of 
service and is in the form of lump sum amount, without an 
upper limit, equivalent to 15 days’ basic salary payable for 
each completed year of service to all eligible employees on 
resignation, retirement, death while in employment or on 
termination of employment. The Bank makes contributions 
to a recognised Gratuity Trust administered by trustees and 
whose funds are managed by insurance companies. In 
respect of erstwhile Lord Krishna Bank (eLKB) employees, 
the Bank makes contribution to a fund set up by eLKB and 
administered by the Board of Trustees. 
The defined gratuity benefit plans are valued by an 
independent actuary as at the Balance Sheet date using 
the projected unit credit method as per the requirement of 
AS-15, Employee Benefits, to determine the present value 
of the defined benefit obligation and the related service 
costs. The actuarial calculations entails assumptions about 
demographics, early retirement, salary increases and 
interest rates. Actuarial gain or loss is recognised in the 
Profit and Loss Account.
Superannuation:
The Bank has a Superannuation Plan under which 
employees of the Bank, above a prescribed grade, are 
entitled to receive retirement benefits either through salary 
or under a defined contribution plan. For those opting for 
a defined contribution plan, the Bank contributes a sum 
equivalent to 13% of the employee’s eligible annual basic 
salary (15% for the whole time directors and for certain 
eligible employees of the erstwhile Centurion Bank of 
Punjab (eCBoP staff)) to a Trust administered by trustees 
and whose funds are managed by insurance companies. 
The Bank has no liability towards future superannuation 
fund benefits other than its contribution and recognises 
such contribution as an expense in the year incurred.
Provident fund:
The Bank is covered under the Employees Provident Fund 
and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 and accordingly 
all employees of the Bank are entitled to receive benefits 
under the provident fund. The Bank contributes an amount, 
on a monthly basis, at a determined rate (currently 12% 
of employee’s basic salary). Of this, the Bank contributes 
an amount equal to 8.33% of employee’s basic salary up 
to a maximum salary level of ` 15,000/- per month, to the 
Pension Scheme administered by the Regional Provident 
Fund Office. The balance amount out of the 12% employer’s 
share is contributed to an exempted Trust set up by the 
Bank and administered by a Board of Trustees. The Bank 
recognises such contributions as an expense in the year in 
which it is incurred. 
Interest payable to the members of the exempted trust shall 
not be lower than the statutory rate of interest declared by 
the Central Government under the Employees Provident 
Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 and 
shortfall, if any, shall be made good by the Bank.
The guidance note on implementing AS-15, Employee 
Benefits, states that benefits involving employer established 
provident funds, which require interest shortfalls to be 
provided, are to be considered as defined benefit plan. 
Actuarial valuation of this Provident Fund interest shortfall 
is done as per the guidance note issued in this respect by 
The Institute of Actuaries of India (IAI) and provision towards 
this liability is made.
The overseas branches of the Bank make contribution to the 
respective applicable government social security scheme 
calculated as a percentage of the employees’ salaries. 
The Bank’s obligations are limited to these contributions, 
which are expensed when due, as such contribution is in 
the nature of defined contribution.

Pension:
In respect of pension payable to certain eLKB employees 
under the Lord Krishna Bank (Employees) Pension 
Scheme, which is a defined benefit scheme, the Bank 
contributes 10% of basic salary to a pension trust set up 
by the Bank and administered by the Board of Trustees and 
an additional amount towards the liability shortfall based on 
an independent actuarial valuation as at the Balance Sheet 
date, which includes assumptions about demographics, 
early retirement, salary increases and interest rates.
In respect of certain eLKB employees who had moved to 
a Cost to Company (CTC) based compensation structure 
and had completed less than 15 years of service, the 
contribution which was made until then, is maintained as a 
fund and will be converted into annuity on separation after a 
lock-in-period of two years. For this category of employees, 
liability stands frozen and no additional provision is required 
except for interest as applicable to Provident Fund, which 
is provided for.
In respect of certain eLKB employees who moved to a CTC 
structure and had completed service of more than 15 years, 
pension would be paid on separation based on salary 
applicable as on the date of movement to CTC structure. 
Provision thereto is made based on an independent 
actuarial valuation as at the Balance Sheet date.
National Pension Scheme (NPS):
In respect of employees who opt for contribution to the 
NPS, the Bank contributes certain percentage of the basic 
salary of employees to the aforesaid scheme, a defined 
contribution plan, which is managed and administered by 
pension fund management companies. The Bank has no 
liability other than its contribution and recognises such 
contributions as an expense in the year incurred.

Debit and credit cards reward points
The Bank estimates the probable redemption of debit 
and credit card reward points and cost per point using an 
actuarial method by employing an independent actuary, 
which includes assumptions such as mortality, redemption 
and spends. Provisions for liabilities on the outstanding 
reward points are made based on an independent actuarial 
valuation as at the Balance Sheet date and included in 
other liabilities and provisions.

Bullion
The Bank imports bullion including precious metal bars on 
a consignment basis. The imports are typically on a backto-back basis and are priced to the customer based on 
the price quoted by the supplier. The difference between 
the price recovered from customers and cost of bullion 
is accounted at the time of sale to the customers and 
reported as ‘‘Other Income’’.
The Bank also deals in bullion on a borrowing and lending 
basis and the interest thereon is accounted as interest 
expense / income respectively.

Lease accounting
Lease payments including cost escalation for assets taken 
on operating lease are recognised in the Profit and Loss 
Account over the lease term on a straight-line basis in 
accordance with the AS-19, Leases. 

Income tax
Income tax expense comprises current tax provision (i.e. 
the amount of tax for the period determined in accordance 
with the Income Tax Act, 1961, the rules framed there 
under and considering the material principles set out in 
Income Computation and Disclosure Standards) and the 
net change in the deferred tax asset or liability during the 
year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for 
the future tax consequences of timing differences between 
the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their 
respective tax bases, and operating loss carried forward, 
if any. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using 
the enacted or substantively enacted tax rates as at the 
Balance Sheet date. 
Current tax assets and liabilities and deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are off-set when they relate to income taxes 
levied by the same taxation authority, when the Bank has 
a legal right to off-set and when the Bank intends to settle 
on a net basis.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent there 
is reasonable certainty that the assets can be realised 
in future. In case of unabsorbed depreciation or carried 
forward loss under taxation laws, deferred tax assets are 
recognised only if there is virtual certainty of realisation 
of such assets. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each 
Balance Sheet date and appropriately adjusted to reflect the 
amount that is reasonably / virtually certain to be realised.

Earnings per share
The Bank reports basic and diluted earnings per equity 
share in accordance with AS-20, Earnings per Share. Basic 
earnings per equity share has been computed by dividing 
net profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders by 
the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding 
for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential 
dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to 
issue equity shares were exercised or converted to equity 
during the year. Diluted earnings per equity share are 
computed using the weighted average number of equity 
Schedules to the Financial Statements
As at March 31, 2023

shares and the dilutive potential equity shares outstanding 
during the period except where the results are anti-dilutive. 

Share issue expenses
Share issue expenses are adjusted against Share Premium 
Account in terms of Section 52 of the Companies Act, 2013.

Segment information 
The disclosure relating to segment information is in 
accordance with AS-17, Segment Reporting and as per 
guidelines issued by RBI.

Accounting for provisions, contingent liabilities and 
contingent assets
In accordance with AS-29, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities 
and Contingent Assets, the Bank recognises provisions 
when it has a present obligation as a result of a past event, 
it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation 
and when a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation 
can be made. 
Provisions are determined based on management estimate 
required to settle the obligation at the Balance Sheet date, 
supplemented by experience of similar transactions. These 
are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and adjusted to 
reflect the current management estimates.
A disclosure of contingent liability is made when there is:
a possible obligation arising from a past event, the 
existence of which will be confirmed by the occurrence 
or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future 
events not within the control of the Bank; or
a present obligation arising from a past event which 
is not recognised as it is not probable that an outflow 
of resources will be required to settle the obligation 
or a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation 
cannot be made.
When there is a possible obligation or a present obligation 
in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is 
remote, no provision or disclosure is made.
Contingent assets, if any, are not recognised in the financial 
statements since this may result in the recognition of 
income that may never be realised.

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash including 
foreign currency notes and gold in hand, balances with 
RBI, balances with other banks and money at call and 
short notice.

Corporate social responsibility
Expenditure towards corporate social responsibility, in 
accordance with Companies Act, 2013, is recognised in 
the Profit and Loss Account.

Basic earnings per equity share of the Bank has been computed by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to the equity 
shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per equity share 
has been computed by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to the equity shareholders by the weighted average 
number of equity shares and dilutive potential equity shares outstanding during the year, except where the results are antidilutive. The dilutive impact is on account of stock options / Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) granted to employees by the Bank. 
There is no impact of dilution on the profits in the current year and previous year.

Plan “E” in June 2010, Plan “F” in June 2013 and Plan “G” in July 2016. Under the terms of each of these Plans, the Bank may 
issue to its employees and Whole Time Directors, Equity Stock Options (‘ESOPs’) each of which is convertible into one equity 
share. All the plans were framed in accordance with the SEBI (Employee Stock Option Scheme & Employee Stock Purchase 
Scheme) Guidelines, 1999 as amended from time to time and as applicable at the time of the grant. The accounting for the 
stock options has been in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Share Based Employee Benefits and 
Sweat Equity) Regulations, 2021 and RBI guidelines to the extent applicable.
Plans C, D, E, F and G provide for the issuance of options at the recommendation of the Nomination and Remuneration 
Committee of the Board (‘NRC’) at the closing price on the working day immediately preceding the date when options are 
granted. This closing price is the closing price of the Bank’s equity share on an Indian stock exchange with the highest trading 
volume as of the working day preceding the date of grant.
Further, the shareholders of the Bank approved the grant of 10,00,00,000 Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”) under Employees’ 
Stock Incentive Master Scheme – 2022 (ESIS-2022) in May, 2022.
The vesting conditions applicable to the options / units are at the discretion of the NRC. These options / units are exercisable 
on vesting, for a period as set forth by the NRC at the time of the grant. The period in which the options and units may be 
exercised cannot exceed five years and one year respectively from the date of expiry of vesting period. During the financial 
year 2022-23, no modifications were made to the terms and conditions of ESOPs. During the previous year 2021-22, the 
Shareholders of the Bank approved certain modifications in the subsisting ESOP Plans to allow any employee of the Bank 
transferred to a subsidiary company, to continue to be entitled to the stock options already granted to such an employee 
during the course of his / her service with the Bank.

Other liabilities
The Bank held provisions towards standard assets amounting to ` 6,988.66 crore as at March 31, 2023 (previous year: 
` 6,562.60 crore). These are included under other liabilities.

Provision for standard assets is made @ 0.25% for direct advances to agriculture, individual housing loans and Small 
and Micro Enterprises (SMEs) sectors, @ 1% for advances to commercial real estate sector, @ 0.75% for advances 
to commercial real estate - residential housing sector, @ 5% on restructured standard advances, @ 2% until after 
one year from the date on which the rates are reset at higher rates for housing loans offered at a comparatively lower 
rate of interest in the first few years and @ 2% on all exposures to the wholly owned step down subsidiaries of the 
overseas subsidiaries of Indian companies, sanctioned / renewed after December 31, 2015.
−Provision is maintained at rates higher than the regulatory minimum, on standard advances based on evaluation of 
the risk and stress in various sectors as per the policy approved by the Board of the Bank.
−In accordance with regulatory guidelines and based on the information made available by its customers to the Bank, 
for exposures to customers who have not hedged their foreign currency exposures, provision for standard assets 
is made at levels ranging up to 0.80% depending on the likely loss the entities could incur on account of exchange 
rate movements.
−Provision for standard assets of overseas branches is made at higher of rates prescribed by the overseas regulator 
or RBI. 
−For all other loans and advances including credit exposures computed as per the current marked to market values 
of interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts, provision for standard assets is made @ 0.40%.
−In accordance with RBI guidelines, an additional provision is made @ 3% on the incremental exposure to the 
"Specified Borrowers" (except NBFCs / HFCs) beyond normally permitted lending limit (NPLL) as defined by RBI.
Other liabilities include contingent provisions of ` 9,232.84 crore as at March 31, 2023 (previous year: ` 9,684.88 crore) 
in respect of advances.
The Bank has presented gross unrealised gain on foreign exchange and derivative contracts under other assets and 
gross unrealised loss on foreign exchange and derivative contracts under other liabilities. Accordingly, other liabilities as 
at March 31, 2023 include unrealised loss on foreign exchange and derivative contracts of ` 9,914.66 crore (previous 
year: ` 7,464.74 crore).
There is no item under Other Liabilities and Provisions -“Others (including provisions)” exceeding 1% of total assets as at 
March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022.
8. Unhedged foreign currency exposure
The Bank has in place a policy and process for managing currency induced credit risk. The credit appraisal memorandum 
prepared at the time of origination and review of a credit facility is required to discuss the exchange risk that the customer 
is exposed to from all sources, including trade related, foreign currency borrowings and external commercial borrowings. It 
could cover the natural hedge available to the customer as well as other hedging methods adopted by the customer to mitigate 
exchange risk. For foreign currency loans granted by the Bank beyond a defined threshold the customer is encouraged to 
enter into appropriate risk hedging mechanisms with the Bank. Alternatively, the Bank satisfies itself that the customer has 
the financial capacity to bear the exchange risk in the normal course of its business and / or has other mitigants to reduce the 
risk. On a periodic basis, the Bank reviews information on the unhedged portion of foreign currency exposures of customers, 
whose total foreign currency exposure with the Bank exceeds a defined threshold. A Board approved credit risk rating linked 
limit on unhedged foreign currency position of customers is applicable when extending credit facilities to a customer. The 
compliance with the limit is assessed by estimating the extent of drop in a customer’s annual Earnings Before Interest and 
Depreciation (‘EBID’) due to a potentially large adverse movement in exchange rate impacting the unhedged foreign currency 
exposure of the customer. Where a breach is observed in such a simulation, the customer is suitably advised to review and 
manage its unhedged exposure, where deemed necessary.
In accordance with RBI guidelines, as at March 31, 2023 the Bank holds standard asset provisions of ` 263.00 crore (previous 
year: ` 355.00 crore) and maintains capital (including CCB & D-SIB) of ` 973.84 crore (previous year: ` 1,412.67 crore) in respect 
of the unhedged foreign currency exposure of its customers.

Qualitative disclosures on risk exposure in derivatives
Overview of business and processes
Derivatives are financial instruments whose characteristics are derived from underlying assets, or from interest rates, 
exchange rates or indices. These include forwards, swaps, futures and options. The notional amounts of financial 
instruments such as foreign exchange contracts and derivatives provide a basis for comparison with the instruments 
recognised on the Balance Sheet but do not necessarily indicate the amounts of future cash flows involved or the current 
fair value of the instruments and, therefore, do not indicate the Bank’s exposure to credit or price risks. The following 
sections outline the nature and terms of the derivative transactions generally undertaken by the Bank. 
Interest rate contracts
Forward rate agreements give the buyer the ability to determine the underlying rate of interest for a specified period 
commencing on a specified future date (the settlement date). The underlying rate of interest could be an interest rate curve, 
interest rate index or bond yield. There is no exchange of principal and settlement is effected on the settlement date. The 
settlement amount is the difference between the contracted rate and the market rate prevailing on the settlement date 
discounted for the interest period of the agreement.
Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of interest obligations with the counterparty for a specified period without 
exchanging the underlying (or notional) principal.
Interest rate caps and floors give the buyer the ability to fix the maximum or minimum rate of interest. The writer of 
the contract pays the amount by which the market rate exceeds or is less than the cap rate or the floor rate respectively. 
A combination of interest rate caps and floors can create structures such as interest rate collar, cap spreads and 
floor spreads. 
Interest rate futures are standardised interest rate derivative contracts traded on a recognised stock exchange to buy 
or sell a notional security or any other interest bearing instrument or an index of such instruments or interest rates at a 
specified future date, at a price determined at the time of the contract.
Exchange rate contracts
Forward foreign exchange contracts are agreements to buy or sell fixed amounts of currency at an agreed exchange rate 
on a future date. These instruments are carried at fair value, determined based on either FEDAI rates or market quotations.
Cross currency swaps are agreements to exchange principal amounts denominated in different currencies. Cross 
currency swaps may also involve the exchange of interest payments on one specified currency for interest payments in 
another specified currency for a specified period.
Currency options (including Exchange Traded Currency Option) give the buyer, on payment of a premium, the right 
but not an obligation, to buy or sell specified amounts of currency at an agreed exchange rate on or before a specified 
future date. 
Currency futures contract is a standardised contract traded on an exchange, to buy or sell a certain underlying currency 
on a certain date in the future, at a specified price. The contract specifies the rate of exchange between one unit of 
currency with another.

For the year ended March 31, 2023
The Bank’s derivative transactions relate to sales and trading activities. Sale activities include the structuring and marketing 
of derivatives to customers to enable them to hedge their market risks (both interest rate and exchange risks), within the 
regulatory framework as applicable from time to time. The Bank deals in derivatives on its own account (trading activity) 
principally for the purpose of generating a profit from short term fluctuations in price yields or implied volatility. The Bank 
also deals in derivatives to hedge the risk embedded in some of its Balance Sheet assets or liabilities.
Constituents involved in derivative business
The Treasury front-office enters into derivative transactions with customers and inter-bank counterparties. The Bank 
has an independent back-office and mid-office as per regulatory guidelines. The Bank has credit risk and market risk 
departments, as part of the Risk Management Group, that assesses counterparty credit risk and market risk limits, within 
the risk architecture and processes of the Bank.
Derivative policy
The Bank has in place a Derivative policy which covers various aspects that apply to the functioning of the derivative 
business. The derivative business is administered through various market risk limits such as position limits, tenor limits, 
sensitivity limits, scenario based profit and loss limit for option portfolio, stop loss trigger levels and value-at-risk limits 
that are recommended by the Risk Policy and Monitoring Committee (‘RPMC’) to the Board of Directors for approval. 
All methodologies that are used to assess market and credit risks for derivative transactions are specified by the market 
risk and credit risk units. Limits are monitored on a daily basis by the mid-office.
The Bank has a Board approved policy on Customer Suitability & Appropriateness, which forms part of the Derivative 
policy, to ensure that derivative transactions entered into are appropriate and suitable to the customer’s nature of 
business / operations. Before entering into a derivative deal with a customer, the Bank scores the customer on various 
risk parameters and based on the overall score level it determines the kind of product that best suits its risk appetite and 
the customer’s requirements.
Classification of derivatives book
The derivative book is classified into trading and hedging book. Classification of the derivative book is made on the basis 
of the definitions of the trading and hedging specified in the RBI guidelines. The trading book is managed within the 
trading limits recommended by the RPMC and approved by the Board of Directors.
Hedging policy
For derivative contracts designated as hedging instruments, the Bank documents, at inception of the hedge, the 
relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, the risk management objective for undertaking the 
hedge and the methods used to assess the hedge effectiveness. Hedge effectiveness is ascertained at the time of 
inception of the hedge and periodically thereafter. Hedge effectiveness is measured by the degree to which changes in 
the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item that are attributable to a hedged risk are offset by changes in the fair value 
or cash flows of the hedging instrument using various qualitative and quantitative methods.
The hedging book consists of transactions to hedge Balance Sheet assets or liabilities. The tenor of hedging instrument 
may be less than or equal to the tenor of underlying hedged asset or liability. The Bank as part of its risk management 
strategy, makes use of derivative instruments, including foreign exchange forward contracts, for hedging the risk embedded 
in some of its financial assets or liabilities recognised on the balance sheet. In case of a fair value hedge, the changes in 
the fair value of the hedging instruments and hedged items are recognised in the Profit and Loss Account and in case of 
cash flow hedges other than for foreign exchange forward contracts and principal only swaps, the changes in fair value 
of effective portion are recognised in Reserves and Surplus under ‘Cash flow hedge reserve’ and ineffective portion of an 
effective hedging relationship, if any, is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account. The accumulated balance in the cash 
flow hedge reserve, in an effective hedging relationship, is recycled in the Profit and Loss Account at the same time that 
the impact from the hedged item is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account. Foreign exchange forward contracts and 
principal only swaps not intended for trading, that are entered into to establish the amount of reporting currency required 
or available at the settlement date of a transaction, and are outstanding at the Balance Sheet date, are effectively valued 
at the closing spot rate. The premia or discount arising at the inception of such forward exchange contract is amortised 
as expense or income over the life of the contract.

Provisioning, collateral and credit risk mitigation
The Bank enters into derivative transactions with counterparties based on their business ranking and financial position. 
The Bank sets up appropriate appetite / limits upon evaluating the ability of the counterparty to honour its obligations in 
the event of crystallisation of the exposure. Appropriate credit covenants are stipulated where required, as trigger events 
to call for collaterals or terminate a transaction and contain the risk. Further, to mitigate the current exposure in noncentrally cleared forex and derivative transactions, Bank has entered into Credit Support Annex (‘CSA’) agreements with 
some of the major international counterparty banks and few Indian financial institutions.
The Bank, at the minimum, conforms to the RBI guidelines with regard to provisioning requirements. Overdue receivables 
representing crystallised positive mark to market value of a derivative contract are transferred to the account of the 
borrower and treated as non-performing assets, if these remain unpaid for 90 days or more. Full provision is made 
for the entire amount of overdue and future receivables relating to positive marked to market value of non-performing 
derivative contracts.

**Amounts given are absolute values on a net basis, excluding currency options.
The notional principal amounts of derivatives reflect the volume of transactions outstanding as at the Balance Sheet date and do not represent 
the amounts at risk.
For the purpose of this disclosure, currency derivatives include currency options purchased and sold and cross currency swaps.
For the purpose of this disclosure, Forward contracts include Tom, Spot, Forward exchange and Fx Swap contracts.
For the purpose of this disclosure, interest rate derivatives include interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and interest rate caps and

The Bank has computed the maximum and minimum of PV01 for the year based on the balances as at the end of every month.
In respect of derivative contracts, the Bank has computed the exposure under the Current Exposure Method for counterparty credit risk capital 
computation based on the guidelines issued by RBI on “Bilateral Netting of Qualified Financial Contracts – Amendments to Prudential Guidelines” 
dated March 30, 2021 and any related amendments thereafter. However, for the purpose of calculating product-wise derivative exposure as 
mentioned in point number 3 in table above, bank has calculated using Current Exposure Method (‘CEM’) without the impact of Bilateral Netting.

Technical or prudential write-offs
 
Technical or prudential write-offs refer to the amount of non-performing assets which are outstanding in the books of 
the branches, but have been written-off (fully or partially) at the head office level. The financial accounting systems of the 
Bank are integrated and there are no write-offs done by the Bank which remain outstanding in the books of the branches.

 Gross advances are net of bills rediscounted and interest in suspense for non-performing advances.

 Net NPAs are non-performing assets net of specific provisions, claims received from Credit Guarantors, provisions for funded interest 
term loans classified as NPAs and provisions in lieu of diminution in the fair value of restructured assets classified as NPAs.

 Net advances are equivalent to gross advances net of specific loan loss provisions, claims received from Credit Guarantors, provision for 
funded interest term loans classified as NPA and provisions in lieu of diminution in the fair value of restructured assets.

 Provision coverage ratio does not include assets written-off.
Divergence in the asset classification and provisioning
 
In terms of the RBI guidelines, banks are required to disclose the divergence in asset classification and provisioning 
consequent to RBI’s annual supervisory process in their notes to accounts to the financial statements, wherever the 
additional provisioning assessed / additional gross NPAs identified by RBI exceeds the threshold specified by RBI. The 
threshold for provisioning is 10 per cent of the reported profit before provisions and contingencies for the reference period 
and that for additional gross NPAs is 10 per cent of the published incremental Gross NPAs for the reference period. 
 
Based on the above, there was no reportable divergence in asset classification and provisioning for NPAs for the years 
ended March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021.

From the above, 58 loans aggregating to ` 11.45 crore was repurchased by the transferor in compliance with 
paragraph 48 of Master Direction - RBI (Transfer of Loan Exposures) Directions, 2021.
The Bank has not acquired any Special Mention Account.
The RBI Master Direction on Transfer of Loan Exposures dated September 24, 2021 has mandated disclosure of 
transfer of loan assets. Considering the terms ‘loans not in default’ and ‘special mention account’ under this circular 
vis-à-vis loans termed as ‘standard’ as hitherto and the separate processes prescribed therein for transfer of such 
assets, the Bank believes that such disclosure would be more meaningful if disclosed prospectively and therefore 
transfer of loan exposures prior to September 24, 2021 are not considered relevant for disclosure.
During the years ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, there were no standard assets securitised-out by 
the Bank.

Securitised assets as per books of SPVs sponsored by the Bank:
 
There are no SPVs sponsored by the Bank as at March 31, 2023 and as at March 31, 2022.
Off-Balance Sheet SPVs
 
There are no Off-Balance Sheet SPVs sponsored by the Bank, which need to be consolidated as per accounting norms.

Contingent liability*
Brief description

Claims against 
the Bank not 
acknowledged as 
debts - taxation
The Bank is a party to various taxation matters in respect of which appeals are pending. The Bank 
expects the outcome of the appeals to be favorable based on decisions on similar issues in the 
previous years by the appellate authorities, based on the facts of the case and taxation laws. 

Claims against 
the Bank not 
acknowledged as 
debts - others
The Bank is a party to various legal proceedings in the normal course of business. The Bank does not 
expect the outcome of these proceedings to have a material adverse effect on the Bank’s financial 
conditions, results of operations or cash flows.

Partly paid investments
This represents amount remaining unpaid towards liability for partly paid investments. 

Liability on account of 
forward exchange and 
derivative contracts
The Bank enters into foreign exchange contracts, currency options, forward rate agreements, 
currency swaps and interest rate swaps with inter-bank participants on its own account and for 
customers. Forward exchange contracts are commitments to buy or sell foreign currency at a 
future date at the contracted rate. Currency swaps are commitments to exchange cash flows by 
way of interest / principal in one currency against another, based on predetermined rates. Interest 
rate swaps are commitments to exchange fixed and floating interest rate cash flows. The notional 
amounts of financial instruments such as foreign exchange contracts and derivatives provide a basis 
for comparison with instruments recognised on the Balance Sheet but do not necessarily indicate 
the amounts of future cash flows involved or the current fair value of the instruments and, therefore, 
do not indicate the Bank’s exposure to credit or price risks. The derivative instruments become 
favorable (assets) or unfavorable (liabilities) as a result of fluctuations in market rates or prices relative 
to their terms. 

Guarantees given on 
behalf of constituents, 
acceptances, 
endorsements and 
other obligations
As a part of its commercial banking activities, the Bank issues documentary credit and guarantees 
on behalf of its customers. Documentary credits such as letters of credit enhance the credit standing 
of the Bank’s customers. Guarantees generally represent irrevocable assurances that the Bank will 
make payments in the event of the customer failing to fulfill its financial or performance obligations.

Other items for 
which the Bank is 
contingently liable
These include: a) Credit enhancements in respect of securitised-out loans; b) Bills rediscounted by 
the Bank; c) Capital commitments; d) Underwriting commitments; e) Investment purchases pending 
settlement; f) Amount transferred to the RBI under the Depositor Education and Awareness Fund 
(DEAF).

Amortisation of expenditure on account of enhancement in family pension of employees of banks
The Reserve Bank of India, vide its notification dated October 04, 2021 granted Banks an option to amortise the expenditure 
on account of enhancement of family pension, over a period not exceeding five years beginning with the financial year ending 
March 31, 2022, subject to a minimum of one-fifth of the total amount involved being expensed every year. The Bank has not 
availed the said option and has recognised the entire expenditure on account of enhancement of family pension in financial 
year ended March 31, 2022.
Provident fund
The guidance note on AS-15, Employee Benefits, states that employer established provident funds, where interest is guaranteed 
are to be considered as defined benefit plans and the liability has to be valued. The Institute of Actuaries of India (IAI) has issued 
a guidance note on valuation of interest rate guarantees on exempt provident funds. The actuary has accordingly valued the 
same and the Bank held a provision of Nil as at March 31, 2023 (previous year: Nil), towards the present value of the guaranteed 
interest benefit obligation. The actuary has followed the deterministic approach as prescribed by the guidance note.

(b) fair compensation given the individual’s skill, competence, experience and market pay position; 
(c) 
contribution to post retirement benefits; and
(d) compliance with all statutory obligations.
The quantum of fixed pay for the Senior Management i.e. Employees in Executive Vice President and above 
grades, Material Risk Takers other than Whole Time Directors, Risk and Control Staff and Key Management 
Personnel are approved by the NRC and the Board. 
The quantum of fixed pay for Whole Time Directors is approved by the NRC and the Board, and is subject to 
the approval of the RBI.
Variable Pay - For Senior Management and Material Risk Takers
 
The performance management system forms the basis for variable pay allocation of the Bank. The Remuneration 
Policy of the Bank ensures that the performance management system is comprehensive and considers both, 
quantitative and qualitative performance measures. 
(i) Composition of Variable Pay
 
The variable pay will be in the form of share linked instruments or a mix of cash and share linked instruments. 
The share linked instrument used in the financial year 2022-23 was the Employee Stock Options. All plans 
for grant of options are framed in accordance with the SEBI guidelines, 1999 as amended from time to 
time and are approved by the shareholders of the Bank. These plans provide for the grant of options post 
approval by the NRC. For Whole Time Directors the variable pay is approved by the NRC, Board and the 
Reserve Bank of India.
 
The Bank will ensure that there is a proper balance between Fixed Pay and Variable Pay. In cases where 
compensation by way of share-linked instruments is not permitted by law / regulations, the entire variable 
pay will be in cash. 

(ii) Limits on Variable Pay
 
A substantial portion of compensation i.e. at least 50% will be variable and paid on the basis of individual, 
business-unit and organization performance. This will be in line with the principle that, at higher levels 
of responsibility, the proportion of variable pay will be higher. The total variable pay shall be limited to a 
maximum of 300% of the fixed pay (for the relative performance period).
 
In case the variable pay is upto 200% of the fixed pay, a minimum of 50% of the variable pay; and in case 
the variable pay is above 200%, a minimum of 67% of the variable pay shall be via non-cash instruments. 
The non-cash component in 2022-23 comprised of Employee Stock Options.
 
In the event that the employee is barred by statute or regulation from grant of share-linked instruments, 
his / her variable pay will be capped at 150% of fixed pay but shall not be less than 50% of the fixed pay.
(iii) Deferral of Variable pay
 
For senior management including Whole Time Directors (WTDs) and Material Risk Takers (MRTs), 
deferral arrangements exists for the variable pay. A minimum of 60% of total variable pay is under deferral 
arrangements. If cash component is a part of the variable pay, at least 50% of the cash bonus is deferred. 
In cases where cash component of the variable pay is under ` 25 lakh, deferral of cash variable pay is not 
applied (in line with RBI guidelines).
 
The deferral period is a minimum of three years and is applicable to both cash and non-cash components 
of variable pay. The deferral period for share linked instruments / ESOPs is governed by the ESOP Scheme 
Rules which is approved by the NRC and the Board. In 2022-23, the deferment of cash variable pay, 
where applicable, was 3 years in the case of cash variable pay and 4 years (vesting period) in the case of 
Employee Stock Options.
(iv) Vesting of Variable Pay 
 
The deferred portion of the remuneration vests at the end of deferral period and is spread out over the 
course of the deferral period. The first vesting is not before one year from the commencement of the 
deferral period. The vesting is no faster than on a pro rata basis and the frequency of the vesting is more 
than a year in order to ensure appropriate assessment of risk. 
(v) Malus / Clawback Arrangement:
 
The Bank believes in sustained business performance in tandem with prudent risk taking. The Bank, 
therefore, has devised appropriate deterrents in order to institutionalize the aforementioned commitment.
 
Malus Arrangement: The provision of a Malus arrangement would entail cancellation of payout for the 
deferred portion of reward (cash variable pay / long term incentive (LTI) i.e. any Share Linked Instrument). 
The RBI guidelines define malus thus “A malus arrangement permits the bank to prevent vesting of all or 
part of the amount of a deferred remuneration. Malus arrangement does not reverse vesting after it has 
already occurred.”
 
Clawback Arrangement: The provision of Clawback arrangement would entail return of payout of reward 
(cash variable pay / long term incentive (LTI) i.e. any Share Linked Instrument) made in the previous years 
attributable to a given reference year wherein the incident has occurred. The return would be in terms of 
net amount. The RBI guidelines define clawback thus “A clawback is a contractual agreement between 
the employee and the bank in which the employee agrees to return previously paid or vested remuneration 
to the bank under certain circumstances.”
 
The malus and clawback clause will be actioned when the employee demonstrates behaviour involving 
fraudulent behaviour, moral turpitude, lack of integrity, flagrant breach of company policies and statutory 
norms resulting in financial or non-financial losses. Manifestation of behaviour listed above is presumed to 
have a malafide intent. Illustrative list of conditions are enumerated below. The occurrence of any / some 
/ all of the following conditions / events shall trigger a review by the NRC for the application of the Malus 
or the Clawback arrangement:

Substantial financial deterioration in profitability or risk parameters
Reckless, negligent or willful actions or exhibited inappropriate values and behavior
Fraud that requires a financial restatement
Reputational harm
Exposing the bank to substantial risk
Such other conditions or events, of similar nature as above, as determined by NRC for triggering 
review by NRC for the purpose of application of the Malus or the Clawback arrangement 
 
In determining the causes for deterioration in financial performance under (a), the NRC may take into 
consideration and have due regard to the fact whether the deterioration was for factors within control or 
whether it was on account of conditions like global market headwinds, industry performance, changes 
in legal / regulatory regime, force majeure events like occurrence of natural disasters, pandemic, other 
socio-economic conditions etc.
 
While undertaking the review for the concerned person for the application of the Malus or the Clawback 
arrangement based on any trigger events, when determining accountability of the concerned person, 
the NRC shall be guided by the principles of proportionality, culpability or proximity or nexus to the event 
or misconduct.
 
In accordance with the RBI guidelines, wherever the assessed divergence in bank’s provisioning for 
Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) or asset classification exceeds the prescribed threshold for public disclosure, the bank shall not pay the unvested portion of the variable compensation for the assessment 
year under ‘malus’ arrangement. Further, in such situations, no proposal for increase in variable pay (for 
the assessment year) shall be entertained. In case the bank’s post assessment gross NPAs are less than 
2.0%, these restrictions will apply only if criteria for public disclosure are triggered either on account of 
divergence in provisioning or both provisioning and asset classification.
 
The NRC may decide to apply malus on part, or all of the variable pay. The time horizon for the application 
of malus / clawback clause shall be four years from the date of reward.
 
The NRC shall review the act of misconduct / incident to ascertain the degree of accountability attributable 
to a Whole Time Director / Material Risk Taker / Senior Management (Job Bands C1 and above) prior to 
applying the Malus or Clawback arrangement.
(vi) Approval Process: 
 
The Variable Pay for Senior Management, Material Risk Takers other than Whole Time Directors, Risk 
and control staff is approved by the NRC and the Board. For Whole Time Directors the variable pay is 
approved by the NRC, Board and the Reserve Bank of India.
 
Employees other than Senior Management, Material Risk Takers, Whole Time Directors
 
The Bank has formulated the following variable pay plans:
(i) Annual Bonus Plan 
 
The quantum of variable payout is a function of the performance of the Bank, performance of the 
business unit, performance of the individual employee, job band of the employee and the functional 
category. Basis these key determinants and due adjustment for risk alignment, a payout matrix for 
variable pay is developed. Market trends for specific businesses / functions along with inputs from 
compensation surveys may also be used in finalising the payout. 
 
Bonus pools are designed to meet specific business needs therefore resulting in differentiation in 
both the quantum and the method of payout across functions. Typically higher levels of responsibility 
receive a higher proportion of variable pay vis-à-vis fixed pay. 
(ii) Performance-linked Plans (PLPs) 
 
PLPs are formulated for employees in sales, collections, customer service and relationship roles 
who are given business / service targets but have limited impact on risk since credit decisions are 
exercised independent of these functions. All PLP payouts are based on a balanced scorecard 

framework which factors not just quantitative, but also qualitative measures, and are subject to 
achievement of individual targets enumerated in the respective scorecards of the employees. A 
portion of the PLP payouts is deferred till the end of the financial year to provide for any unforeseen 
performance risks. Employees who are on the PLPs are excluded from the Annual Bonus Plan.
(iii) Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOPs)
 
Employees in Job Bands D3 and above also receive ESOPs as a vehicle to create a balance between 
short term rewards and long term sustainable value creation. ESOPs play a key role in the attraction 
and retention of key talent. 
 
The NRC grants options after considering parameters such as the incumbent’s grade and performance 
rating, and such other factors as may be deemed appropriate by the NRC. 
 
All plans for grant of options are framed in accordance with the SEBI guidelines, 1999 as amended 
from time to time and are approved by the shareholders of the Bank. These plans provide for the 
grant of options post approval by the NRC.
 
The Bank grants ESOPs to eligible employees. Such ESOPs vest over four tranches spread over a 
period of 48 months. 
 
In accordance with the RBI guidelines, Employee Stock Options is included as part of Variable Pay.
(iv) Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)
 
The bank introduced RSUs in FY2022-23 for employees at E3 – D2 bands (upto 10 levels below the 
MD).
 
The overall grant criteria is based on the bank meeting certain parameters such as shareholder’s 
return, asset quality, return on assets, profitability and return on capital.
 
The quantum of RSUs to be granted to individual employees was based on an employee’s grade 
and performance rating over the previous three years.
 
The vesting criteria would be based on the profitability of the bank.
 
All plans for grant of RSUs are framed in accordance with the SEBI guidelines, 1999 as amended 
from time to time and are approved by the shareholders of the Bank. These plans provide for the 
grant of RSUs post approval by the NRC.
 
Such RSUs vest over four tranches spread over a period of 48 months.
 
Risk, Control and Compliance Staff
 
The Bank has separated the Risk, Control and Compliance functions from the Business functions 
in order to create a strong culture of checks and balances and to eliminate any possible conflict 
of interest between revenue generation and risk management and control. Accordingly, the overall 
variable pay as well as the annual salary increment of the employees in the Risk, Control and 
Compliance functions is based on their performance, functional objectives and goals. The Bank 
ensures that the mix of fixed to variable compensation for these functions is weighted in favour of 
fixed compensation. 
 
Guaranteed Bonus
 
Guaranteed bonuses are not consistent with sound risk management or pay for performance 
principles of the Bank and therefore do not form an integral part of the general compensation practice. 
 
For critical hiring for some select strategic roles, the Bank may consider granting of bonus, based 
on the performance rating upon confirmation, as a prudent way to avoid loading the entire cost 
of attraction into the fixed component of the compensation which could have a long term cost 
implication for the Bank. For such hiring, the said bonus is generally decided by taking into account 
appropriate risk factors and market conditions.

For hiring at levels of Whole Time Directors / Managing Director / Material Risk Takers and certain 
employees in select strategic roles, a sign-on bonus, if any, is limited to the first year only and would 
be in the form of Employee Stock Options.
 
Severance Pay
 
The Bank does not grant severance pay other than accrued benefits (such as gratuity, pension) 
except in cases where it is mandated by any statute. 
 
Hedging
 
The Bank does not provide any facility or fund or permit its Whole Time Directors and employees to 
insure or hedge their compensation structure to offset the risk alignment effects embedded in their 
compensation arrangement. 
 
Statutory Bonus
 
Some employees are also paid statutory bonus as per the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965 as amended 
from time to time.
III. Remuneration Processes
 
Fitment at the time of hire
 
Pay scales at the Bank are set basis the job size, experience, location and the academic and professional credentials 
of the incumbent. 
 
The compensation of new hires is in line with the existing pay ranges and consistent with the compensation levels of 
the existing employees of the Bank at similar profiles. The pay ranges are subject to change basis market trends and 
the Bank’s talent management priorities. While the Bank believes in the internal equity and parity as a key determinant 
of pay, it does acknowledge the external competitive pressures of the talent market. Accordingly, there could be 
certain key profiles with critical competencies which may be hired at a premium and treated as an exception to the 
overall pay philosophy. Any deviation from the defined pay ranges is treated as a hiring exception requiring approval 
with appropriate justification.
 
Pay Increment / Pay Revision
 
The Bank strives to ensure external competitiveness as well as internal equity without diluting the overall focus on 
optimising cost. In order to enhance the Bank’s external competitiveness, it participates in an annual salary survey of 
the banking sector to understand key market trends as well as get insights on relative market pay position compared 
to peers. The Bank endeavors to ensure that most employees progress to the median of the market in terms of 
fixed pay over time. This coupled with key internal data indicators like performance score, job family, experience, 
job grade and salary budget form the basis of decision making on revisions in fixed pay. 
 
Increments in fixed pay for majority of the employee population are generally undertaken once every financial year. 
However, promotions, confirmations and change in job dimensions could also lead to a change in the fixed pay 
during other times of the financial year.
 
The Bank also makes salary corrections and adjustments during the financial year for competitive pay positioning for 
the purpose of retention of critical skills and critical talent in the domain of Information Technology, Digital, Information 
Security, Data Science as well as business segments that are strategic focus areas of the bank. However, such pay 
revisions are done on an exception basis.
 
The Fixed Pay for the Material Risk Takers (other than Whole time Directors), Senior Management, Key Management 
Personnel is approved by the NRC and the Board. The Fixed Pay for the Whole Time Directors is approved by the 
NRC, Board and the Reserve Bank of India.
Description of the ways in which current and future risks are taken into account in the remuneration processes, 
including the nature and type of the key measures used to take account of these risks
The Bank takes into account various types of risks in its remuneration processes. The Bank follows a comprehensive 
framework that includes within its ambit the key dimensions of remuneration such as fixed pay, variable pay and long 
term incentives (i.e. Employee Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units). 

Fixed pay: The Bank conducts a comprehensive market benchmarking study to ensure that employees are competitively 
positioned in terms of fixed pay. The Bank follows a robust salary review process wherein revisions in fixed compensation 
are based on performance. The Bank also makes salary adjustments taking into consideration pay positioning of 
employees vis-à-vis market reference points. Through this approach the Bank endeavors to ensure that the talent risk 
due to attrition is mitigated. Fixed pay could be revised downwards as well, in the event of certain proven cases of 
misconduct by an employee.
Variable pay: The Bank has distinct types of variable pay plans as given below:
(a) Quarterly / monthly performance-linked pay (PLP) plans:
All quarterly / monthly PLP plans are based on the principle of balanced scorecard framework that includes within its 
ambit both quantitative and qualitative factors including key strategic objectives that ensure future competitive advantage 
for the Bank. PLP plans, by design, have deterrents that play a role of moderating payouts based on the non-fulfillment 
of established quantitative / qualitative risk factors. Deterrents also include risks arising out of non-compliance, mis-sell 
etc. Further, a portion of all payouts under the PLP plans is deferred till the end of the financial year to provide for any 
unforeseen performance risks. Employees who are part of the PLP plans are excluded from the Annual Bonus Plan.
(b) Variable Pay:
The Bank takes into consideration the fact that a portion of the Bank’s profits are directly attributable to various types of 
risks the Bank is exposed to such as credit risk and market risk.
The framework developed by the Bank in order to arrive at the quantum of bonus pool is based on the performance of 
the Bank and profitability. The annual variable pay is distributed based on business unit, individual performance, job band 
and role of the individual for non-business functions. The business unit performance is based on factors such as growth 
in revenue, growth in profit, cost to income ratio and achievement vis-à-vis plans and key objectives. Bonus pay out for 
an individual employee in a particular grade is linked to the performance rating of the employee and subject to meeting 
the Bank’s standards of ethical conduct. 
The Bank has devised appropriate malus and claw back clauses as a risk mitigant for Whole Time Directors, Material Risk 
Takers, Senior Management (i.e. employees in the job Bands of Executive Vice President and above ). Under the malus 
clause the incumbent could forego the vesting of the deferred variable pay in full or in part. Under the claw back clause 
the incumbent is obligated to return all the tranches of variable pay payout pertaining to the reference performance year. 
The deferred variable pay is paid out post review and approval by the NRC and the Board.
Description of the ways in which the Bank seeks to link performance during a performance measurement 
period with levels of remuneration
The Bank has a robust performance management system for evaluating the performance of its Whole Time Directors. 
The performance appraisal system is based on a Balanced Scorecard Framework and considers qualitative as well as 
quantitative factors of performance which includes the following parameters:
Business Performance - This includes business growth, profitability, asset quality and shareholder value
Stakeholder Relationship - This includes net promoter score and corporate social responsibility
Audit and Compliance - This includes internal audit reports and compliance with the regulations and 
inspection reports
Digital Transformation - This includes performance on initiatives required to run the bank and grow the bank
Organizational Excellence - This includes succession planning and employee engagement
While the above parameters form the core evaluation parameters for the Bank and the remuneration of its Whole Time 
Directors, each of the business units are measured on the following from a remuneration standpoint:
Increase in plan over the previous year;
Actual growth in revenue over previous year;
Growth in net revenue (%);
Achievement of net revenue against plan (%);
Actual profit before tax;

Growth in profit before tax compared to the previous year; 
Improvement in cost to income over the previous year;
Improvement in Gross NPA over the previous year; and
Achievement of key strategic objectives.
The process by which levels of remuneration in the Bank are aligned to the performance of the Bank, business unit and 
individual employees is articulated below:
Fixed Pay
The Bank reviews the fixed pay portion of the compensation structure basis merit-based increments and market 
corrections. These are based on a combination of performance rating, job band and the functional category of the 
individual employee. For a given job band, the merit increment is directly related to the performance rating. The Bank 
strives to ensure that most employees progress to the median of the market in terms of fixed pay over time. All other 
things remaining equal, the correction percentage is directly related to the performance rating of the individual.
Variable Pay
Basis the performance of the business unit, individual performance and role, the Bank has formulated the following 
variable pay plans: 
Variable Pay Plans:
 
For Employees in Job Bands of Vice President and Above (includes employees in Senior Management, 
Material Risk Takers, Whole Time Directors) the variable pay intends to reward short term as well as long term 
sustained performance of the bank and shareholder value creation.
 
Short term Performance: Short term performance is realised in the form of cash variable pay. The cash variable 
pay is based on performance rating and the job band of the individual and is further enhanced or moderated by the 
business performance multiplier and role. The cash variable pay is computed on the gross salary. 
 
Long term Performance: Employee Stock Options are granted to employees based on their performance rating 
and job band and the value of the same is realised vide long term performance of the bank and creation of 
shareholder value. 
 
For Employees in job bands below Vice President:
 
At these levels the variable pay is primarily in the form of cash variable pay and is based on the annual performance. 
In FY 2022-23, the Bank introduced RSUs for select employees at E3-D2 bands based on their performance rating 
over the previous three years and grade. 
 
The Bank’s annual bonus is computed as a percentage of the gross salary for every job band. The bonus multiple 
is based on performance of the business unit (based on the parameters above), performance rating, job band and 
the functional category of the individual employee. The business performance category determines the multiplier for 
the bonus. All other things remaining equal, for a given job band, the bonus is directly related to the performance 
rating. Employees who are part of the annual cash Variable Pay plan are not part of the Performance Linked Plans 
mentioned below.
Performance-linked Plans (PLPs)
 
The Bank has formulated PLPs for its sales, collections, customer service and relationship roles who are given 
sales, collections and service targets basis a balanced scorecard methodology. All PLP payouts are subject to the 
achievement of individual targets enumerated in the respective scorecards of the employees and moderated by 
qualitative parameters. A portion of the PLP payouts is deferred till the end of the financial year to provide for any 
unforeseen performance risks. All PLPs are based on a balanced scorecard framework and, depending on the plan, 
could be paid out monthly or quarterly.
Description of the ways in which the Bank seeks to adjust remuneration to take account of the longer term 
performance
 
For employees in Senior Management, Material Risk Takers and Whole Time Directors the bank seeks to adjust 
remuneration to take account of the longer term performance in the following way.

(i) Limits on variable pay
 
A substantial portion of compensation i.e. at least 50% will be variable and paid on the basis of individual, businessunit and organization performance. This will be in line with the principle that, at higher levels of responsibility, the 
proportion of variable pay will be higher. The total variable pay shall be limited to a maximum of 300% of the fixed pay.
 
In case the variable pay is upto 200% of the fixed pay, a minimum of 50% of the variable pay; and in case the 
variable pay is above 200%, a minimum of 67% of the variable pay shall be via non-cash instruments. The non-cash 
component in 2022-23 comprised of Employee Stock Options.
 
In the event that the employee is barred by statute or regulation from grant of share linked instruments, his / her 
variable pay will be capped at 150% of fixed pay but shall not be less than 50% of the fixed pay.
(ii) Deferral of variable pay
 
For senior management including Whole Time Directors (WTDs) and Material Risk Takers (MRTs), deferral arrangements 
will exist for the variable pay. A minimum of 60% of total variable pay will be under deferral arrangements. If cash 
component is a part of the variable pay, at least 50% of the cash bonus shall be deferred. In cases where cash 
component of the bonus is under ` 25 lakh, deferral arrangements would not be necessary.
 
The deferral period would be a minimum of three years and will be applicable to both cash and non-cash components 
of variable pay. The deferral period for share linked instruments / ESOPs will be governed by the ESOP Scheme Rules 
which will be approved by the NRC and the Board. In 2022-23 the deferment of cash variable pay, where applicable, 
was 3 years in the case of cash variable pay and 4 years (vesting period) in the case of Employee Stock Options.
(iii) Vesting of Variable Pay 
 
The deferred portion of the remuneration will vest at the end of deferral period and will be spread out over the course 
of the deferral period. The first vesting would not be before one year from the commencement of the deferral period. 
The vesting would be no faster than on a pro rata basis and the frequency of the vesting would be more than a year 
in order to ensure appropriate assessment of risk. 
(iv) Malus / Clawback Arrangement:
 
The Bank believes in sustained business performance in tandem with prudent risk taking. The Bank, therefore, has 
devised appropriate deterrents in order to institutionalize the aforementioned commitment.
 
Malus Arrangement: The provision of a Malus arrangement would entail cancellation of payout for the deferred 
portion of reward (cash variable pay / long term incentive (LTI) i.e. any Share Linked Instrument). The RBI guidelines 
define malus thus “A Malus arrangement permits the bank to prevent vesting of all or part of the amount of a deferred 
remuneration. Malus arrangement does not reverse vesting after it has already occurred.”
 
Clawback Arrangement: The provision of Clawback arrangement would entail return of payout of reward (cash 
variable pay / long term incentive (LTI) i.e. any Share Linked Instrument) made in the previous years attributable 
to a given reference year wherein the incident has occurred. The return would be in terms of net amount. The 
RBI guidelines define clawback thus “A Clawback is a contractual agreement between the employee and the 
bank in which the employee agrees to return previously paid or vested remuneration to the bank under certain 
circumstances.”
 
The malus and clawback clause will be actioned when the employee demonstrates behaviour involving fraudulent 
behaviour, moral turpitude, lack of integrity, flagrant breach of company policies and statutory norms resulting in 
financial or non-financial losses. Manifestation of behaviour listed above is presumed to have a malafide intent. 
Illustrative list of conditions are enumerated below. The occurrence of any / some / all of the following conditions / 
events shall trigger a review by the NRC for the application of the Malus or the Clawback arrangement:
Substantial financial deterioration in profitability or risk parameters
Reckless, negligent or willful actions or exhibited inappropriate values and behavior
Fraud that requires a financial restatement
Reputational harm
Exposing the bank to substantial risk

Such other conditions or events, of similar nature as above, as determined by NRC for triggering review by 
NRC for the purpose of application of the Malus or the Clawback arrangement 
 
In determining the causes for deterioration in financial performance under (a), the NRC may take into consideration 
and have due regard to the fact whether the deterioration was for factors within control or whether it was on account

While undertaking the review for the concerned person for the application of the Malus or the Clawback arrangement 
based on any trigger events, when determining accountability of the concerned person, the NRC shall be guided 
by the principles of proportionality, culpability or proximity or nexus to the event or misconduct.
 
In accordance with the RBI guidelines, wherever the assessed divergence in bank’s provisioning for Non-Performing 
Assets (NPAs) or asset classification exceeds the prescribed threshold for public disclosure, the bank shall not pay 
the unvested portion of the variable compensation for the assessment year under ‘malus’ arrangement. Further, 
in such situations, no proposal for increase in variable pay (for the assessment year) shall be entertained. In case 
the bank’s post assessment Gross NPAs are less than 2.0%, these restrictions will apply only if criteria for public 
disclosure are triggered either on account of divergence in provisioning or both provisioning and asset classification.
 
The NRC may decide to apply malus on part, or all of the unvested deferred Variable pay. The time horizon for the 
application of malus / clawback clause shall be four years from the date of reward.
 
The NRC shall review the act of misconduct / incident to ascertain the degree of accountability attributable to a 
Whole Time Director / Material Risk Taker / Senior Management (C1 and above) prior to applying the Malus or 
Clawback arrangement.
 
The criteria for Malus / Clawback will be reviewed by the NRC annually.
Employees other than Whole Time Directors, Material Risk Takers and Senior Management
The Bank has formulated the following variable pay plans:
Annual Variable Pay plan:
 
The quantum of variable payout is a function of the performance of the Bank, performance of the individual employee, 
job band of the employee and the functional category. Basis these key determinants and due adjustment for risk 
alignment, a payout matrix for variable pay is developed. Market trends for specific businesses / functions along 
with inputs from compensation surveys may also be used in finalising the payout. 
 
Bonus pools are designed to meet specific business needs therefore resulting in differentiation in both the quantum 
and the method of payout across functions. Typically higher levels of responsibility receive a higher proportion of 
variable pay vis-à-vis fixed pay. 
 
Variable Pay intends to reward short term as well as long term sustained performance of the bank and shareholder 
value creation.
 
Short term Performance: Short term performance is realised in the form of cash variable pay. The cash variable 
pay is based on performance rating, the job band of the individual and is further enhanced or moderated by the 
business performance multiplier and role. The cash variable pay is computed on the gross salary. 
 
Long term Performance: Employee Stock Options are granted to employees at D3 and above bands based on 
their performance rating and Job band and the value of the same is realised vide long term performance of the bank 
and creation of shareholder value. The vesting period for Employee Stock Option is 4 years.
 
The Bank also introduced Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) to employees at E3-D2 bands in FY22-23. The RSUs would 
vest over 4 years.
Performance-linked Plans (PLPs)
 
The Bank has formulated PLPs for its sales, collections, customer service and relationship roles who are given 
sales, collections and service targets basis a balanced scorecard methodology. All PLP payouts are subject to the 
achievement of individual targets enumerated in the respective scorecards of the employees and moderated by 

qualitative parameters. A portion of the PLP payouts is deferred till the end of the financial year to provide for any 
unforeseen performance risks. All PLPs are based on a balanced scorecard framework and, depending on the plan, 
could be paid out monthly or quarterly.
Description of the different forms of variable remuneration (i.e. cash, shares, ESOPs and other forms) that the 
Bank utilises and the rationale for using these different forms
 
The Bank recognises the importance of variable pay in reinforcing a pay for performance culture. Variable pay stimulates 
employees to stretch their abilities to exceed expectations.
Annual Cash Variable Pay
 
These are paid to reward performance for a given financial year. This covers all employees (excluding employees 
under PLPs). This is based on performance of the business unit, performance rating, job band and functional 
category of the individual. For higher job bands the proportion of variable pay to total compensation tends to be 
higher. For Material Risk Takers, Senior Management and Whole Time Directors 50% of the cash variable pay is 
deferred over 3 years in the event the cash variable pay exceeds ` 25 lakhs.
Performance-linked Plans (PLPs)
 
The Bank has formulated PLPs for its sales, collections, customer service and relationship roles who are given 
sales, collections and service targets basis a balanced scorecard methodology. All PLP payouts are subject to the 
achievement of individual targets enumerated in the respective scorecards of the employees and moderated by 
qualitative parameters. A portion of the PLP payouts is deferred till the end of the financial year to provide for any 
unforeseen performance risks. All PLPs are based on a balanced scorecard framework and, depending on the plan, 
could be paid out monthly or quarterly.
Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP)
 
This is to reward for contribution of employees in creating a long term, sustainable earnings and enhancing 
shareholder value. Only employees in a certain job band and with a specific performance rating are eligible for 
stock options. Performance is the key criteria for granting stock options.
Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)
 
The Bank introduced Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) for employees at E3-D2 bands in FY22-23. The RSUs would 
vest over 4 years.

Qualitative disclosure on LCR
The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) is one of the Basel Committee’s key reforms to develop a more resilient banking sector. 
The objective of the LCR is to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banks. It does this by ensuring 
that banks have an adequate stock of unencumbered High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) that can be converted easily and 
immediately into cash to meet their liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario. The LCR is expected to 
improve the banking sector’s ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress, whatever the source, thus 
reducing the risk of spillover from the financial sector to the real economy.
The Liquidity Risk Management of the Bank is governed by the Asset Liability Management (ALM) Policy approved by the Board. 
The Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) is a decision making unit responsible for implementing the liquidity and interest rate risk 
management strategy of the Bank in line with its risk management objectives and ensures adherence to the risk tolerance / 
limits set by the Board. The Bank has also set up a senior level management committee, viz., the Group Risk Management 
Committee (GRMC) under the ICAAP framework of the Bank, to establish a formal and dedicated structure to periodically 
assess the nature / quantum of material risks of the subsidiaries and adequacy of its risk management processes, including 
providing oversight for managing liquidity risk. Liquidity for the Bank’s domestic banking operations is directly managed at 
the Head Office. The overseas branches and offshore unit of the Bank independently manage their liquidity requirements 
with support from the Head Office. Similarly, the Bank’s subsidiaries independently manage their liquidity requirements under 
guidance of the GRMC, which, along with senior management of the subsidiaries, reviews the risk assessment of material 
risks at the subsidiaries. Further, the Bank maintains suitable systems and processes to monitor liquidity requirements in other 
currencies as appropriate.
In order to determine cash outflows, the Bank segregates its deposits into various customer segments, viz., Retail (which 
include deposits from individuals), Small Business Customers (those with deposits upto `7.5 crore), and Wholesale (which 
would cover all residual deposits). Within Wholesale, deposits that are attributable to clearing, custody, and cash management 
services are classified as Operational Deposits. Other contractual funding, including a portion of other liabilities which are 
expected to run down in a 30 day time frame are included in the cash outflows. These classifications, based on extant regulatory 
guidelines, are part of the Bank’s LCR framework, and are also submitted to the RBI.
The LCR is calculated by dividing a Bank's stock of HQLA by its total net cash outflows over a 30 day stress period. The 
guidelines for LCR were effective January 01, 2015, with the minimum requirement at 60% which have risen in equal annual 
steps to reach 100% on January 01, 2019. This graduated approach was designed to ensure that the LCR could be introduced 
without material disruption to the orderly strengthening of banking systems or the ongoing financing of economic activity. The 
present requirement, as on March 31, 2023 is 100%.
In the Indian context, the run-off factors for the stressed scenarios are prescribed by the RBI, for various categories of liabilities 
(viz., deposits, unsecured and secured wholesale borrowings), undrawn commitments, derivative-related exposures, and 
offset with inflows emanating from assets maturing within the same time period. Given below is a table of run-off factors and

38. Implementation of IFRS converged Indian Accounting Standards
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs, in its press release dated January 18, 2016, had issued a roadmap for implementation of 
Indian Accounting Standards (IND-AS) for scheduled commercial banks, insurers / insurance companies and non-banking 
financial companies, which was subsequently confirmed by the RBI through its circular dated February 11, 2016. This roadmap 
required these institutions to prepare IND-AS based financial statements for the accounting periods beginning April 01, 2018 
with comparatives for the periods beginning April 01, 2017. The implementation of IND-AS by banks requires certain legislative 
changes in the format of financial statements to comply with the disclosures required under IND-AS. In April 2018, the RBI 
deferred the implementation of IND-AS by a year by when the necessary legislative amendments were expected. The legislative 
amendments recommended by the RBI are under consideration by the Government of India. Accordingly, the RBI, through 
its circular dated March 22, 2019, deferred the implementation of IND-AS until further notice. 
The Bank, being an associate of Housing Development Finance Corporation Limited (the ‘Corporation’), submits its consolidated 
financial information (‘fit for consolidation information’), prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement 
principles of IND-AS as specified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, to the Corporation for the purposes of 
the consolidated financial statements / results of the Corporation. The results of the Bank upon its first time adoption of and 
transition to IND-AS, based on the updated regulations and accounting standards / guidance and business strategy at the 
date of actual transition, could differ from those reported in the fit for consolidation information.

39. COVID-19
The COVID-19 virus, a global pandemic affected the world economy over the last two to three years. The extent to which any
new wave of COVID-19 will impact the bank's results will depend on ongoing as well as future developments, including, among 
other things, any new information concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any action to contain its spread or
mitigate its impact whether government-mandated or elected by us.
40. Disclosure under Rule 11 (e) of the Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014

Independent Auditor's Report
To the Members of HDFC Bank Limited
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of HDFC Bank Limited (hereinafter referred to as the 
“Bank” or the “Parent”), its subsidiaries (Parent and its subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”), and the Employee 
welfare trust, which comprise the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31 March, 2023, and the Consolidated Profit and Loss 
Account and the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement for the year then ended, and notes to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to 
as “the Consolidated Financial Statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid Consolidated 
Financial Statements give the information required by the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 as well as the Companies Act, 2013 
(“the Act”) in the manner so required for banking companies and are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted 
in India and give a true and fair view of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group and the Employee welfare trust as at 31 
March, 2023, of consolidated profit and its consolidated cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our 
responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements” section of our report. We are independent of the Group and the Employee welfare trust, in accordance 
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in India in terms of the 
Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the relevant provisions of the Act, and we have 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports referred to in paragraph 17 of the 
“Other Matters” section below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We 
have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.

Identification and Provisioning of Non-performing advances (NPA):
Total NPA as at March 31, 2023: ` 18,011.85 Crores
Provision for NPA as at March 31, 2023: ` 13,643.71 Crores
(Refer Schedule 17 (C) (2), Schedule 18 note 12 of the standalone financial statements)
Key Audit Matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
The Bank is required to comply with the Master Circular dated 1 
October, 2021 issued by the Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) on “Prudential 
Norms for Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning 
pertaining to Advances” (the “IRAC norms”) and amendments thereto, 
which prescribe the guidelines for identification and classification of 
Non-performing Advances (“NPA”) and the minimum provision required 
for such assets. The Bank is also required to apply its judgement 
to determine the identification and provision required against NPA 
considering various quantitative as well as qualitative factors.
The identification of NPA is also affected by factors like stress and 
liquidity concerns in certain sectors.
The provision for identified NPA is estimated based on ageing and 
classification of NPA, value of security etc. and is also subject to the 
minimum provisioning norms specified by RBI.
Our audit procedures included the following:
- Understood the process and controls, and tested the design 
and operating effectiveness of key controls, including Information 
Technology based controls, and focused on the following:
• Monitoring of credit quality which amongst other things includes 
the monitoring of overdue loan accounts, drawing power limit, 
pending security creation;
• Identification and classification of NPA in accordance with 
IRAC norms, other regulatory guidelines issued by the RBI and 
consideration of qualitative aspects; and
• Testing of application controls include testing of automated 
controls, reports and system reconciliations.
- Evaluated the governance process and controls over calculations 
of provision of non-performing advances, basis of provisioning in 
accordance with the Board approved policy.
- Tested the controls for identification of loans with default events 
and / or breach of other qualitative factors, and for a sample of 
performing loans, independently assessed as to whether there was 
a need to classify such loans as NPA.
- On a test check basis, verified the accounts classified by the Bank 
as Special Mention Accounts (‘SMA’) in RBI’s Central Repository of 
Information on Large Credits (‘CRILC’).
- With respect to provisions recognised towards NPA, we 
reperformed the provision calculations on a sample basis taking 
into consideration the value of security, where applicable, the IRAC 
norms and NPA policy of the Bank, and compared our outcome to 
that prepared by the management and tested relevant assumptions 
and judgements which were used by the management.

Independent Auditor's Report
Information Technology (“IT”) Systems and Controls impacting Financial Reporting
Key Audit Matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
The IT environment of the Bank is complex and involves a large 
number of independent and interdependent IT systems used in the 
operations of the Bank for processing and recording a large volume 
of transactions.
As a result, there is a high degree of reliance and dependency on such 
IT systems for the financial reporting process of the Bank.
Appropriate IT general controls and IT application controls are required 
to ensure that such IT systems are able to process the data as required, 
completely, accurately, and consistently for reliable financial reporting.
We have identified certain key IT systems (“in-scope” IT systems) 
which have an impact on the financial reporting process and the 
related control testing as a key audit matter because of the high level of 
automation, significant number of systems being used by the Bank for 
processing financial transactions, the complexity of the IT architecture 
and its impact on the financial records and financial reporting process 
of the Bank.
 
Our procedures with respect to this matter included the following: 
In assessing the controls over the IT systems of the Bank, we 
involved our technology specialists to obtain an understanding of the 
IT environment, IT infrastructure and IT systems. We evaluated and 
tested relevant IT general controls over the “in-scope” IT systems and 
IT dependencies identified as relevant for our audit of the standalone 
financial statements and financial reporting process of the Bank. On 
such “in-scope” IT systems, we have tested key IT general controls with 
respect to the following domains:
• Program change management, which includes that program 
changes are moved to the production environment as per defined 
procedures and relevant segregation of environment is ensured. 
• User access management, which includes user access provisioning, 
de- provisioning, access review, password management, sensitive 
access rights and segregation of duties to ensure that privilege 
access to applications, operating systems and databases in the 
production environment were granted only to authorized personnel.
• Program development, which includes controls over IT application 
development or implementation and related infrastructure, which are 
relied upon for financial reporting.
• IT operations, which includes job scheduling, monitoring and backup 
and recovery.
We also evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness 
of relevant key IT dependencies within the key business process, 
which included testing automated controls, automated calculations /
accounting procedures, interfaces, segregation of duties and system 
generated reports, as applicable.
We communicated with those charged with governance and 
management and tested a combination of compensating controls or 
remediated controls and / or performed alternative audit procedures, 
where necessary.

The following Key Audit Matters were included in the audit report dated 12 April 2023 containing an unmodified audit opinion 
on the special purpose financial statements of HDB Financial Services Limited, a subsidiary of the Bank issued by their joint 
auditors B. K. Khare & Co. and KKC & Associates LLP, independent firms of Chartered Accountants reproduced by us as under:

Key Audit Matter
How the Key Audit Matter was addressed in our audit
Provisioning based on Income Recognition, Asset Classification & Provisioning (‘IRACP’) norms of Reserve Bank of 
India and testing of Impairment of assets, more particularly the Loan Book of the Company
Refer to the accounting policies in ‘Note 20.2 to the Group Financial Reporting Package : Receivable from Financing Activity’, ‘Note 20.8 to 
the Group Financial Reporting Package : Revenue Recognition’ and ‘Note 20.16 to the Group Financial Reporting Package : Provisioning 
on Receivable from Financing Activity’*
Subjective estimates:
Provisions in respect of non-performing and restructured 
advances are made by the management basis its assessment 
of the degree of impairment of the advances and / or 
increase of significant credit risks subject to the minimum 
provisioning levels prescribed under the Prudential Norms 
on Income Recognition, Asset Classification & Provisioning 
(‘IRACP’), prescribed by the RBI from time to time. The 
provision on non-performing assets (NPAs) are also based 
on the existence and valuation of the security available. In 
case of restructured accounts, provision is ascertained in the 
light of regulatory requirements and the RBI guidelines.
The aforesaid is identified as Key Audit Matter considering 
significance of the management’s judgement involved in 
determining the credit risk and adequacy of the provision, 
more particularly in view of the fact that ascertained 
provisions are in excess of the prescribed regulatory norms 
contained in IRACP.
Our key audit procedures included:
Review of Policy / procedures & design / controls
- Minutely going through the Board approved Policy and approach 
concerning the assessment of credit and other risks and 
ascertainment / ageing of default by the borrowers and procedures 
in relation to stages and NPA computation.
- Assessing the design, implementation and operating effectiveness 
of key internal financial controls including monitoring process of 
overdue loans (and those which became overdue after the reporting 
date), measurement of provision, identification of NPA accounts, 
assessing the reliability of management information, which included 
overdue reports.
- Understanding management’s approach, interpretation, systems 
and controls implemented in relation to probability of default 
and stage-wise bifurcation of product-wise portfolios for timely 
ascertainment of stress and early warning signals.
- Testing of review controls over measurement of provisions and 
disclosures in Group Financial Reporting Package.
- Involvement of Information system resource to obtain comfort over 
data integrity and process of report generation through interface of 
various systems.
Substantive verification
- Test of details over of calculation of NPA provisions, including 
provisions on restructured loans, as at the year- end for assessing 
the completeness, accuracy and relevance of data and to ensure 
that the same is in compliance with the Prudential and IRACP 
Norms.
- Obtaining adequate understanding of regulatory updates pertaining 
to IRACP and allied matters and verifying the Company’s endeavours 
for the compliance thereof.
* These notes are included in schedule 17 (D) (2) and schedule 17 (D) (8) of the consolidated financial statements.

Key Audit Matter
How the Key Audit Matter was addressed in our audit
Information Technology
IT systems and controls
The 
Company’s 
financial 
reporting 
processes 
are 
dependent on technology considering significant number 
of transactions that are processed daily across multiple and 
discrete Information Technology (‘IT’) systems. The Financial 
accounting system of the Company is interfaced with several 
other IT systems including Loan Management & Originating 
systems and several other systemic workflows.
IT general and application controls are critical to ensure that 
changes to applications and underlying data are made in 
an appropriate manner. Adequate controls contribute to 
mitigating the risk of potential fraud or errors as a result of 
changes to the applications and data.
These includes implementation of preventive and detective 
controls across critical applications and infrastructure.
Due to the pervasive nature of role of information technology 
systems in financial reporting, in our preliminary risk 
assessment, we planned our audit by assessing the risk 
of a material misstatement arising from the technology as 
significant for the audit, hence the Key Audit Matter.
In course of audit, our focus was on user access management, change 
management, segregation of duties, system reconciliation controls and 
system application controls over key financial accounting and reporting 
systems. We performed a range of audit procedures, which included:
- Review of the report of IS Audit carried in earlier year(s) by an 
independent firm of Chartered Accountants pertaining to IT systems 
general controls including access rights over applications, operating 
systems and databases relied upon for financial reporting.
- Deployed our internal experts to carry out IT general Controls 
testing and identifying gaps, if any.
- Our other processes include:
- Selectively recomputing interest calculations and maturity dates;
- Selectively re-evaluating masters updation, interface with resultant 
reports;
- Selective testing of the interface of INFOR with other IT systems like 
LMS and other workflows.
- Testing of the system generated reports and accounting entries 
manually for core financial reporting matters (i.e. verification around 
the computer system).
- Evaluating the design, implementation and operating effectiveness 
of the significant accounts-related IT automated controls which are 
relevant to the accuracy of system calculation, and the consistency 
of data transmission.
- Other areas that were independently assessed included password 
policies, system configurations, system interface controls, controls 
over changes to applications and databases.

The following Key Audit Matters were included in the audit report dated 14 April 2023 containing an unmodified audit opinion 
on the special purpose financial statements of HDFC Securities Limited, a subsidiary of the Bank issued by their auditors BSR 
& Co. LLP, an independent firm of Chartered Accountants reproduced by us as under:
Key Audit Matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
IT systems and controls
Information Technology (“IT”) systems and controls
The Company’s key financial accounting and reporting processes are 
dependent on the automated controls in information systems, such that 
there exists a risk that gaps in the IT control environment could impact 
the financial accounting and reporting significantly.
The Company uses Sun system for its overall financial reporting. 
The Company’s General Ledger system used in financial reporting is 
interfaced with other IT systems which process transactions of account 
relevant for financial reporting.
We have focused on user access management, change management, 
segregation of duties, system reconciliation controls and system 
application controls over key financial accounting and reporting systems.
1. Performed testing the design of General IT Controls (GITCs) for the 
audit period which included controls over access to program and 
data, program changes, system changes, program development, 
computer operations (job processing, data backup, system backup, 
incident management) over financial accounting and reporting 
systems and related IT systems (referred to as ‘in-scope systems’).
2. Testing the operating effectiveness of GITCs for the audit period 
over the in-scope systems as follows:
 a) User access creation, modification and revocation process;
 b) User access review process;- Segregation of duties;

of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group and the employee welfare trust and for preventing and detecting frauds 
and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that 
were operating effectively for ensuring accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and 
presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
by the Board of Directors of the Bank, as aforesaid.
In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group 
and the trustees of the Employee welfare trust are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group and the Employee welfare 
trust to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group and the Employee welfare trust or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
10. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and the trustees of the Employee welfare trust are 
responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the Group and the employee welfare trust.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
11. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material 
if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on 
the basis of these Consolidated Financial Statements.
12. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout 
the audit. We also:
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to fraud 
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is 
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, 
or the override of internal control.
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 
in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether 
the Bank has adequate internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements in place and the 
operating effectiveness of such controls.
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by management.
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit 
evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt 
on the ability of the Group and the Employee welfare trust to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material 
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated 
financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit 
evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and 
the Employee welfare trust to cease to continue as a going concern.
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the disclosures, 
and whether the Consolidated Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation.

Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within 
the Group and the Employee welfare trust to express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements. We are 
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the financial statements of such entities included 
in the Consolidated Financial Statements of which we are the independent auditors. For the other entities included in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been audited by other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible 
for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our 
audit opinion.
13. We communicate with those charged with governance of the Bank and such other entities included in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during 
our audit.
14. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought 
to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
15. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. 
We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, 
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
Other Matters
16. The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bank for the year ended 31 March, 2022, were jointly audited by MSKA & 
Associates and M M Nissim and Co LLP, who, vide their report dated 16 April, 2022, expressed an unmodified opinion on 
those Consolidated Financial Statements.
17. We did not audit the financial statements of 2 subsidiaries and Employee welfare trust whose financial statements reflect total 
assets of ` 80,032.73 crore and net assets of ` 13,775.00 crore as at 31 March, 2023, total revenue of ` 15,061.09 crore, net 
profit of ` 2,853.26 crore and net cash out flows amounting to ` 1,006.88 crore for the year ended on that date, as considered 
in the Consolidated Financial Statements. These financial statements have been audited by other auditors whose reports have 
been furnished to us by the Management, and our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements insofar as it relates to the 
amounts and disclosures included in respect of these subsidiaries and the Employee welfare trust and our report in terms of 
sub-section (3) of Section 143 of the Act including report on Other Information insofar as it relates to the aforesaid subsidiaries 
is based solely on the reports of the other auditors.
Our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements, and our report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements below, is 
not modified in respect of the above matters with respect to our reliance on the work done and the reports of the other auditors.
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
18. In our opinion, the Balance Sheet and the Profit and Loss Account have been drawn up in accordance with the provisions of 
Section 29 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and Section 133 of the Act.
19. As required by sub-section (3) of Section 30 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, we report that:
we have obtained all the information and explanations which, to the best of our knowledge and belief, were necessary 
for the purpose of our audit and have found them to be satisfactory;
the transactions of the Bank, which have come to our notice, have been within the powers of the Bank;
During the course of our audit we have visited 69 branches to examine the books of accounts and other records maintained 
at the branch and performed other relevant audit procedures. Since the key operations of the Bank are automated with 
the key applications integrated to the core banking system, the audit is carried out centrally at the Bank’s Head Office 
located in Mumbai as all the necessary records and data required for the purposes of our audit are available there.

HDFC Bank Limited Integrated Annual Report 2022-23

Independent Auditor's Report
Annexure A to Independent Auditor’s Report
Referred to in paragraph 20(f) of the Independent Auditor’s Report of even date to the members of HDFC Bank Limited on the 
consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March, 2023.
Independent Auditor’s Report on the Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements under clause (i) of sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’)
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of HDFC Bank Limited (‘the Bank’ or ‘the Parent’) as of 
and for the year ended 31 March, 2023, we have audited the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements 
of the Bank and its subsidiaries (the Bank and its subsidiaries together referred to as ‘the Group’) and the Employee welfare 
trust, which are companies incorporated in India, as of that date. Reporting under clause (i) of sub section 3 of Section 143 of 
the Act in respect of the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements is not applicable to 
one Employee welfare trust incorporated in India namely HDB Employee welfare trust whom IFCFR is not applicable, pursuant 
to MCA notification GSR 583(E) dated 13 June, 2017.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The respective Board of Directors of the Group, to whom reporting under clause (i) of sub section 3 of Section 143 of the 
Act in respect of the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements is applicable, which 
are companies incorporated in India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on 
internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Group considering the essential components of internal 
control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (“the Guidance Note”) 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”). These responsibilities include the design, implementation 
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient 
conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective Group’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention 
and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of 
reliable financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Group’s internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI and the 
Standards on Auditing deemed to be prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable 
to an audit of internal financial controls, both applicable to an audit of internal financial controls and both issued by the ICAI. 
Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit 
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial 
statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system 
with reference to consolidated financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with 
reference to consolidated financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference 
to consolidated financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design 
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s 
judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether 
due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their 
reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion 
on the Group’s internal financial controls system with reference to consolidated financial statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to financial statements
A Group's internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements is a process designed to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements

for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Group's internal financial control with 
reference to consolidated financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of 
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Group; 
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial 
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Group are 
being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the Group; and (3) provide reasonable 
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the Group's assets that 
could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to financial statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements, including 
the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may 
occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to consolidated 
financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the 
policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Group, has in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system with reference to 
consolidated financial statements and such internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements were 
operating effectively as at 31 March, 2023, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the 
Group considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.
Other Matters
Our aforesaid reports under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal financial 
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements insofar as it relates to two subsidiary companies which are 
companies incorporated in India, is based on the corresponding reports of the auditors of such companies incorporated in 
India. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

Significant 
accounting 
policies appended to and forming part of the 
consolidated financial statements for the year 
ended March 31, 2023
BACKGROUND
HDFC Bank Limited (‘HDFC Bank’ or ‘the Bank’), 
incorporated in Mumbai, India is a publicly held banking 
company engaged in providing a range of banking and 
financial services including retail banking, wholesale 
banking and treasury operations. The Bank is governed

Act, 2013. The Bank has overseas branch operations in 
Bahrain, Hong Kong, Dubai and Offshore Banking Unit at

company. HSL is a financial services provider along with

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements comprise the 
financial statements of the Bank and its subsidiaries 
constituting the ‘Group’. The Bank consolidates its 
subsidiaries in accordance with Accounting Standard (‘AS’) 
21, Consolidated Financial Statements, specified under 
Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, on a line-by-line 
basis by adding together the like items of assets, liabilities, 
income and expenditure, after necessary elimination 
of intra-group transactions and intra-group balances. 
Capital reserve / Goodwill on consolidation represent the 
difference between the Bank’s share in the net worth of the 
subsidiary and the cost of acquisition at the time of making 
the investment in the subsidiary.
BASIS OF PREPARATION
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared 
and presented under the historical cost convention and 
accrual basis of accounting, unless otherwise stated and 
are in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting 
Principles in India (‘GAAP’), statutory requirements

the Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2021, in so 
far as they apply to banks.
 
Use of estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in 
conformity with GAAP requires the management to make 
estimates and necessary assumptions in the reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities (including contingent 
liabilities) as of the date of the consolidated financial 
statements and the reported income and expenses for the 
reporting year. Management believes that the estimates 
used in the preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements are prudent and reasonable. Actual results 
could differ from these estimates. Any revision in the 
accounting estimates is recognised prospectively in the 
current and future periods.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Investments
 
HDFC Bank Limited 
 
Classification:
In accordance with the RBI guidelines, investments are 
classified on the date of purchase into “Held for Trading” 
(‘HFT’), “Available for Sale” (‘AFS’) and “Held to Maturity” 
(‘HTM’) categories (hereinafter called “categories”). 
Subsequent shifting amongst the categories is done 
in accordance with the RBI guidelines. Under each of 
these categories, investments are further classified under 
six groups (hereinafter called “groups”) - Government 
Securities, Other Approved Securities, Shares, Debentures 
and Bonds, Investments in Subsidiaries / Joint Ventures 
and Other Investments. 
Purchase and sale transactions in securities are accounted 
on settlement date except in the case of equity shares 
which are accounted on trade date.
Basis of classification:
Investments that are held for resale within 90 days from 
the date of purchase are classified under HFT category. 
Investments which the Bank intends to hold till maturity are 
classified under HTM category. Investments in the equity 
of subsidiaries / joint ventures are classified under HTM 
category. Investments which are not classified in either of 
the above categories are classified under AFS category.
Acquisition cost:
Brokerage, commission, etc. and broken period interest 
on debt instruments are recognised in the Profit and Loss 
Account and are not included in the cost of acquisition.
Disposal of investments:
Profit / Loss on sale of investments under the aforesaid three 
categories is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account. 
Cost of investments is determined based on the weighted 
average cost method. The profit from sale of investment 
under HTM category, net of taxes and transfer to statutory 
reserve is appropriated from the Profit and Loss Account 
to “Capital Reserve”.
Short sale: 
The Bank undertakes short sale transactions in Central 
Government dated securities in accordance with the RBI 
guidelines. The short position is categorised under HFT 
category and netted off from investments. The short 
position is marked to market and loss, if any, is charged to 
the Profit and Loss Account while gain, if any, is ignored. 
Profit / Loss on short sale is recognised on settlement date. 
Valuation:
Investments classified under AFS and HFT categories 
are marked to market individually and depreciation / 
appreciation is aggregated for each group. Net depreciation, 
if any, compared to the acquisition cost, in any of the six 
groups, is charged to the Profit and Loss Account. The net 
appreciation, if any, in any of the six groups is not recognised 
except to the extent of depreciation provided earlier. The 
book value of individual securities is not changed on such 
revaluation of investments.
Traded investments are valued based on the trades / 
quotes on the recognised stock exchanges or prices 
published by Financial Benchmarks India Pvt Ltd. 
(FBIL) with Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives 
Association (FIMMDA) as the calculating agent. Investments 
denominated in foreign currencies are valued based on the 
prices provided by market information providers such as 
Bloomberg, Refinitiv, etc.
The market value of unquoted government of India securities, 
state government securities and special bonds such as oil 
bonds, fertilizer bonds etc. issued by the government of 
India, is computed as per the prices published by FBIL with 
FIMMDA as the calculating agent.
The valuation of other unquoted fixed income securities (viz. 
other approved securities and bonds and debentures), and 
preference shares, is done with appropriate mark-up, i.e. 
applicable FIMMDA published credit spread over the Yield 
to Maturity (YTM) rates for government of India securities as 
published by FBIL with FIMMDA as the calculating agent.
Unquoted equity shares are valued at the break-up 
value, if the latest Balance Sheet is available or at ` 1 for 
each company. 
Units of mutual funds are valued at the latest net asset value 
declared by the respective schemes of the mutual fund. 
Treasury bills, commercial papers and certificate of deposits 
being discounted instruments, are valued at carrying cost. 
Investments in Security receipts (SR) and unquoted 
units of Infrastructure Investment Trust (InvIT) are valued 
as per the net asset value provided by the issuing Asset 
Reconstruction Company and InvIT trust respectively. 
Investments in unquoted units of Alternative Investment 
Fund (AIF) are categorised, at the discretion of the Bank, 
under HTM category for an initial period of three years and 

valued at cost during this period. Such investments are 
transferred to the AFS category after the said period of 
three years. Investments in AFS category are valued at 
NAV shown by the AIF in its financial statements. Units are 
valued based on the latest audited financials of the AIF, if 
available, or at ` 1 per AIF as per the RBI guidelines.
Pass Through Certificates (PTC) including Priority SectorPTCs are valued by using FIMMDA credit spread as 
applicable for the NBFC category, based on the credit rating 
of the respective PTC over the YTM rates for government 
of India securities published by FBIL with FIMMDA as the 
calculating agent. 
Investments classified under HTM category are carried 
at their acquisition cost and not marked to market. Any 
premium on acquisition is amortised over the remaining 
maturity period of the security on a constant yield to 
maturity basis. Such amortisation of premium is adjusted 
against interest income from investments. Any diminution, 
other than temporary, in the value of investments in HTM 
category is provided for.
Non-performing investments are identified and provision 
are made thereon based on the RBI guidelines. The 
provision on such non-performing investments is not set 
off against the appreciation in respect of other performing 
investments. Interest on non-performing investments is not 
recognised until received.
Repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions:
Repurchase (Repo) and reverse repurchase (Reverse 
Repo) transactions are reflected as borrowing and lending 
transactions respectively. 
Borrowing cost on repo transactions is accounted as 
interest expense and revenue on reverse repo transactions 
is accounted as interest income.
HDFC Securities Limited
Investments that are readily realisable and are intended 
to be held for not more than one year from the date, on 
which such investments are made, are classified as current 
investments. All other investments are classified as long 
term investments. Current investments are carried at cost 
or fair value, whichever is lower. Long-term investments are 
carried at cost. However, provision for diminution is made 
to recognise a decline, other than temporary, in the value 
of the investments, such reduction being determined and 
made for each investment individually.
HDB Financial Services Limited
Investments expected to mature after twelve months are 
taken as long term / non-current investment and stated 
at cost. Provision is recognised only in case of diminution, 
which is other than temporary in nature. Investments 
maturing within three months from the date of acquisition 
are classified as cash equivalents if they are readily 
convertible into cash. All other investments are recognised 
as short term / current investments and are valued at lower 
of cost and net realisable value.

Advances
 
HDFC Bank Limited
 
Classification:
Advances are classified as performing and non-performing 
based on the RBI guidelines and are stated net of bills 
rediscounted, inter-bank participation with risk, specific 
loan loss provision, interest in suspense for non-performing 
advances, claims received from Credit Guarantors, 
provision for funded interest term loan and provision for 
diminution in the fair value of restructured assets. 
Provisioning:
The Bank classifies its loans and investments, including 
at overseas branches and overdues from crystallised 
derivative contracts, into performing and non-performing 
in accordance with RBI guidelines. Further the NPAs are 
classified into sub-standard, doubtful and loss assets 
based on the RBI guidelines. Non-performing assets are 
upgraded into standard as per the extant RBI guidelines.
Specific loan loss provision in respect of non-performing 
advances is made based on management’s assessment 
of the degree of impairment of advances, subject to the 
minimum provisioning prescribed by the RBI. 
The specific provision for retail non-performing advances 
is also made based on the nature of product and 
delinquency levels. 
Specific loan loss provision in respect of non-performing 
advances is included under Provisions and Contingencies. 
Non-performing advances are written-off in accordance 
with the Bank’s policy. Recoveries from bad debts writtenoff are included under other income. 
In relation to derivative contracts with non-performing 
borrowers, the Bank makes provision for the entire amount 
of overdue and future receivables relating to positive 
marked to market value of the said derivative contracts.
The Bank maintains general provision for standard assets 
including credit exposures computed as per the current

is maintained at the higher of the levels stipulated by the 
respective overseas regulator or RBI. The provision for 
standard assets is included under other liabilities.
In addition to the above, the Bank on a prudent basis 
makes provision on advances or exposures which are not 
NPAs, but has reasons to believe on the basis of the extant 
environment or specific information or basis regulatory 
guidance / instructions, of a possible slippage of a specific 
advance or a group of advances or exposures or potential 
exposures. These are classified as contingent provisions 
and included under other liabilities.
Provision made in addition to the Bank’s policy for specific 
loan loss provision for non-performing assets, possible 
slippage of specific exposures and regulatory general 
provision is categorised as floating provision. Creation of 
floating provision is considered by the Bank up to a level 
approved by the Board of Directors. Floating provisions 
are used only for contingencies under extraordinary 
circumstances and for making specific provisions for nonperforming accounts. Floating provisions are included 
under other liabilities.
Further to the provisions required to be held according 
to the asset classification status, provision is held for 
individual country exposures (other than for home country 
exposure). Countries are categorised into risk categories 
as per Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd. 
(‘ECGC’) guidelines and provisioning is made in respect of 
that country where the net funded exposure is one percent 
or more of the Bank’s total assets. Provision for country risk 
is included under other liabilities.
In accordance with the RBI guidelines on the prudential 
framework for resolution of stressed assets and the 
resolution frameworks for COVID-19 related stress and 
its Board approved policy, the Bank has implemented 
resolution plans for eligible borrowers. The asset 
classification and necessary provision thereon is made in 
accordance with the said RBI guidelines. The restructured 
loans are upgraded into standard category as per the 
extant RBI guidelines.
HDB Financial Services Limited
Classification:
Receivables under financing activity are classified as 
standard, sub-standard and doubtful assets as per the 
Company policy approved by the Board and as per RBI 
guidelines. The rates applied for making provisions on nonperforming assets (NPA) are higher than those required by 
the relevant RBI guidelines. Interest on non-performing 
assets is transferred to an interest suspense account and 
not recognised in the Profit and Loss Account until received. 
Receivables under financing activity are recognised on 
disbursement of loan and in case of new asset financing 
on the transfer of ownership.
Provisioning:
The Company assesses all receivables for their recoverability 
and accordingly recognises provision for non-performing 
and doubtful assets as per approved Company policies 
and guidelines. The Company ensures provisions made are 
not lower than as stipulated by RBI guidelines.
The Company provides 0.40% on standard assets as 
stipulated by RBI guidelines.
Loan origination costs:
Brokerage, commission, incentive to employee, etc. paid 
at the time of acquisition of loans are charged to expenses.

Securitisation and transfer of assets
HDFC Bank Limited
Assets transferred through securitisation and direct 
assignment of cash flows are de-recognised in the Balance 
Sheet when they are sold (true sale criteria being fully met 
with) and consideration is received. Sales / transfers that do 
not meet true sale criteria are accounted for as borrowings. 
For a securitisation or direct assignment transaction, the 
Bank recognises profit upon receipt of the funds and loss 
is recognised at the time of sale.
On sale of stressed assets, if the sale is at a price below 
the net book value (i.e., funded outstanding less specific 
provisions held), the shortfall is charged to the Profit and 
Loss Account and if the sale is for a value higher than the 
net book value, the excess provision is credited to the 
Profit and Loss Account in the year when the sum of cash 
received by way of initial consideration and / or redemption 
or transfer of security receipts issued by SC / RC exceeds 
the net book value of the loan at the time of transfer.
In respect of stressed assets sold under an asset 
securitisation, where the investment by the bank in security 
receipts (SRs) issued against the assets transferred by it is 
more than 10 percent of such SRs, provisions held against 
outstanding SRs are higher of the provisions required in 
terms of net asset value declared by the Securitisation 
Company (‘SC’) / Reconstruction Company (‘RC’) and 
provisions as per the extant norms applicable to the 
underlying loans, notionally treating the book value of these 
SRs as the corresponding stressed loans assuming the 
loans remained in the books of the Bank. 
The Bank invests in Pass Through Certificates (PTCs) issued 
by Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs). These are accounted 
at acquisition cost and are classified as investments. The 
Bank also buys loans through the direct assignment route 

which are classified as advances. These are carried at 
acquisition cost unless it is more than the face value, in 
which case the premium is amortised based on effective 
interest rate method.
The Bank transfers advances through inter-bank 
participation with and without risk. In the case of participation 
with risk, the aggregate amount of the participation issued 
by the Bank is reduced from advances. In case where 
the Bank is assuming risk by participation, the aggregate 
amount of the participation is classified under advances. 
In the case of issue of participation certificate without 
risk, the aggregate amount of participation issued by the 
Bank is classified under borrowings and where the Bank 
is acquiring participation certificate, the aggregate amount 
of participation acquired is shown as due from banks 
under advances.
HDB Financial Services Limited 
Prior to Issuance of RBI Circular dated August 21, 2012
On receivables being assigned / securtised, the 
assets are de-recognised as all the rights, title, 
future receivables & interest thereof are assigned 
to the purchaser.

assignment contract as per the RBI guidelines, 
while loss, if any is recognised upfront.
Post Issuance of RBI Circular dated August 21, 2012
Securitised receivables are de-recognised in the 
Balance Sheet when they are sold i.e. they meet

transactions are recognised in the Profit and 
Loss Account only when it is redeemed in cash 
by the SPV after adjusting for overdue receivable 
for more than 90 days. Losses, if any, are 
recognised upfront.

Fixed assets and depreciation
 
HDFC Bank Limited
Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation as adjusted for impairment, if any. Cost 
includes cost of purchase and all expenditure like site 
preparation, installation costs and professional fees 
incurred on the asset before it is ready to use. Subsequent 
expenditure incurred on assets put to use is capitalised only 
when it increases the future benefit / functioning capability 
from / of such assets. 
Depreciation is charged over the estimated useful life of 
the fixed asset on a straight-line basis. The management 
believes that the useful life of assets assessed by the 
Bank, pursuant to Part C of Schedule II to the Companies 
Act, 2013, taking into account changes in environment, 
changes in technology, the utility and efficacy of the asset 
in use, fairly reflects its estimate of useful lives of the fixed 
assets. The estimated useful lives of key fixed assets are

Whenever there is a revision of the estimated useful 
life of an asset, the unamortised depreciable amount 
is charged over the revised remaining useful life of the 
said asset.

and transfer to statutory reserve, are transferred to 
capital reserve.

discounts and rebates. Subsequent expenditure on 
an intangible asset is charged to the Profit and Loss 
Account as an expense unless it is probable that such 
expenditure will enable the intangible asset increase 
the future benefits from the existing asset beyond its 
previously assessed standard of performance and 
such expenditure can be measured and attributed 
to the intangible asset reliably, in which case, such 
expenditure is capitalised.
Expenditure on software development eligible for 
capitalisation are carried as Intangible assets under 
development where such assets are not yet ready for 
their intended use.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives. The 
amortisation period and the amortisation method 
are reviewed at least at each reporting date. If the 
expected useful life of the asset is significantly different 
from previous estimates, the amortisation period is 
changed accordingly.
Gains or losses arising from the retirement or disposal 
of an intangible asset are determined as the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and recognised as income or 
expense in the Profit and Loss Account in the year 
of disposal.
All intangible assets costing less than ` 5,000 
individually are fully amortised in the year of acquisition.

Translation of foreign currency items
HDFC Bank Limited
Foreign currency income and expenditure items of domestic 
operations are translated at the exchange rates prevailing 
on the date of the transaction. Income and expenditure 
items of integral foreign operations (representative offices) 
are translated at the weekly average closing rates and 
of non-integral foreign operations (foreign branches and 
offshore banking units) at the monthly average closing rates.
Outstanding foreign currency monetary items of domestic 
and integral foreign operations are translated at the closing 
exchange rates notified by Foreign Exchange Dealers’ 
Association of India (FEDAI) as at the Balance Sheet date 
and the resulting net revaluation profit or loss is recognised 
in the Profit and Loss Account.
Both monetary and non-monetary foreign currency 
assets and liabilities of non-integral foreign operations 
are translated at closing exchange rates notified by FEDAI 
at the Balance Sheet date and the resulting profit / loss 
arising from exchange differences are accumulated in the 
Foreign Currency Translation Reserve until disposal of the 
non-integral foreign operations in accordance with AS-11, 
The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates and the 
extant RBI guidelines.
Foreign currency denominated contingent liabilities on 
account of foreign exchange and derivative contracts, 
guarantees, letters of credit, acceptances and 
endorsements are translated at closing rates of exchange 
notified by FEDAI as at the Balance Sheet date.
HDFC Securities Limited
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the rates 
of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction. 
Exchange differences, if any arising out of transactions 
settled during the year are recognised in the Profit and 
Loss Account. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies as at the Balance Sheet date are 
translated at the closing exchange rate on that date. The 
exchange differences, if any, are recognised in the Profit 
and Loss Account and related assets and liabilities are 
accordingly restated in the Balance Sheet.

Foreign exchange and derivative contracts
HDFC Bank Limited
Foreign exchange spot and forward contracts, outstanding 
as at the Balance Sheet date and held for trading, are 
revalued at the closing spot and forward rates respectively 
as notified by FEDAI and at interpolated rates for contracts 
of interim maturities. The USD-INR exchange rate for 
valuation of contracts having longer maturities i.e. greater 
than one year, is derived using the USD-INR spot rate as 
well as relevant INR yield curve and USD yield curve. For 
other currency pairs and non-deliverable contracts, the 
forward points (for rates / tenors not published by FEDAI) 
are obtained / derived basis data published by Refinitiv 
or Bloomberg for valuation of the contracts. Valuation is 
considered on present value basis. For this purpose, the 
forward profit or loss on the contracts are discounted to the 
valuation date using the discounting yields. The resulting 
profit or loss on valuation is recognised in the Profit and 
Loss Account. Marked to market value of foreign exchange 
contracts are classified as assets when the fair value is 
positive or as liabilities when the fair value is negative.

As at March 31, 2023
Foreign exchange forward contracts not intended for 
trading, that are entered into to establish the amount of 
reporting currency required or available at the settlement 
date of a transaction and are outstanding at the Balance 
Sheet date, are effectively valued at the closing spot rate. 
The premium or discount arising at the inception of such 
forward exchange contract is amortised on a straight line 
basis as expense or income over the life of the contract.
The Bank recognises all derivative contracts at fair value, 
on the date on which such derivative contracts are entered 
into and are re-measured at fair value as at the Balance 
Sheet date. Marked to market values of such derivatives 
are classified as assets when the fair value is positive or as 
liabilities when the fair value is negative. 
The Bank as part of its risk management strategy, makes 
use of derivative instruments, including foreign exchange 
forward contracts, for hedging the risk embedded in 
some of its financial assets or liabilities recognised on the 
balance sheet. The Bank identifies the hedged item (asset 
or liability) at the inception of the transaction itself. Hedge 
effectiveness is ascertained at the time of the inception of 
the hedge and at the reporting date thereafter.
In case of a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of 
the hedging instruments and hedged items are recognised 
in the Profit and Loss Account and in case of cash flow 
hedges, the changes in fair value of effective portion are 
recognised in Reserves and Surplus under ‘Cash flow 
hedge reserve’ and ineffective portion of an effective 
hedging relationship, if any, is recognised in the Profit 
and Loss Account. The accumulated balance in the cash 
flow hedge reserve, in an effective hedging relationship, is 
recycled in the Profit and Loss Account at the same time 
that the impact from the hedged item is recognised in the 
Profit and Loss Account.
HDB Financial Services Limited
Derivative contracts are designated as cash flow hedges, 
the hedging instrument is measured at fair value and any 
gain or loss that is determined to be an effective hedge is 
recognised within equity i.e., Cash Flow Hedge Reserve. 
Amounts recognised in equity are transferred to the Profit 
and Loss Account in the same period as the cash flows of 
hedged items affect the Profit and Loss Account. When a 
derivative contract expires or is sold or if a hedge no longer 
meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative 
profit or loss in the Cash Flow Hedge Reserve is retained 
in equity until the hedged cash flow is recognised in the 
Profit and Loss Account. However, if hedged cash flows 
are no longer expected to occur, the profit or loss against 
the corresponding derivative contract, accumulated in the 
Cash Flow Hedge Reserve, is immediately released through 
the Profit and Loss Account. Changes in the fair values 
of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge 
accounting are recognised immediately in the Profit and 
Loss Account.

Employee benefits
HDFC Bank Limited
Stock based Employee Compensation: 
The Employee Stock Option Scheme (‘the Scheme’) 
provides for the grant of options to acquire equity shares 
of the Bank to its employees and whole time directors. 
The Employee Stock Incentive Master Scheme -2022 
(ESIS-2022) provides for the grant of Restricted Stock 
Units (RSUs) to acquire equity shares of the Bank to its 
employees and whole-time directors. The options / units 
granted shall vest as per their vesting schedule and these 
may be exercised within a specified period. 
The Bank follows the intrinsic value method to account for 
its stock-based employee compensation plans in respect of 
options granted up to March 31, 2021. Compensation cost 
is measured by the excess, if any, of the market price of 
the underlying stock over the exercise price as determined 
under the option plan. The market price is the closing 
price on the stock exchange where there is highest trading 
volume on the working day immediately preceding the date 
of grant. 
Effective April 01, 2021, the fair value of share-linked 
instruments on the date of grant for all instruments granted 
after March 31, 2021 is recognised as an expense in 
accordance with the RBI guidelines on Compensation of 
Whole Time Directors / Chief Executive Officers / Material 
Risk Takers and Control Function staff. The fair value of the 
stock-based employee compensation is estimated on the 
date of grant using Black-Scholes model. 
The compensation cost is amortised on a straight-line 
basis over the vesting period after adjusting estimated 
forfeiture. Ultimately, the cost for all instruments that vest 
is recognized. The compensation expense is recognised in 
the Profit and Loss Account with a corresponding credit to 
Employee Stock Options Reserve. On exercise of the stock 
options, corresponding balance in Employee Stock Options 
Reserve is transferred to Share Premium. In respect of the 
options which expire unexercised, the balance standing to 
the credit of Employee Stock Options Reserve is transferred 
to General Reserve.
Gratuity:
The Bank has an obligation towards gratuity, a defined 
benefit retirement plan covering all eligible employees. 
The plan benefit vests upon completion of five years of 
service and is in the form of lump sum amount, without an 
upper limit, equivalent to 15 days’ basic salary payable for 
each completed year of service to all eligible employees on 
resignation, retirement, death while in employment or on 
termination of employment. The Bank makes contributions 
to a recognised Gratuity Trust administered by trustees and 
whose funds are managed by insurance companies. In 
respect of erstwhile Lord Krishna Bank (eLKB) employees, 
the Bank makes contribution to a fund set up by eLKB and 
administered by the Board of Trustees. 
The defined gratuity benefit plans are valued by an 
independent actuary as at the Balance Sheet date using 
the projected unit credit method as per the requirement of 
AS-15, Employee Benefits, to determine the present value 
of the defined benefit obligation and the related service 
costs. The actuarial calculations entails assumptions about 
demographics, early retirement, salary increases and 
interest rates. Actuarial gain or loss is recognised in the 
Profit and Loss Account.
Superannuation:
The Bank has a Superannuation Plan under which 
employees of the Bank, above a prescribed grade, are 
entitled to receive retirement benefits either through salary 
or under a defined contribution plan. For those opting for 
a defined contribution plan, the Bank contributes a sum 
equivalent to 13% of the employee’s eligible annual basic 
salary (15% for the whole time directors and for certain

eligible employees of the erstwhile Centurion Bank of 
Punjab (eCBoP staff)) to a Trust administered by trustees 
and whose funds are managed by insurance companies. 
The Bank has no liability towards future superannuation 
fund benefits other than its contribution, and recognises 
such contribution as an expense in the year incurred.
Provident fund:
The Bank is covered under the Employees Provident Fund 
and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 and accordingly 
all employees of the Bank are entitled to receive benefits 
under the provident fund. The Bank contributes an amount, 
on a monthly basis, at a determined rate (currently 12% 
of employee’s basic salary). Of this, the Bank contributes 
an amount equal to 8.33% of employee’s basic salary up 
to a maximum salary level of ` 15,000/- per month, to the 
Pension Scheme administered by the Regional Provident 
Fund Office. The balance amount out of the 12% employer’s 
share is contributed to an exempted Trust set up by the 
Bank and administered by a Board of Trustees. The Bank 
recognises such contributions as an expense in the year in 
which it is incurred. Interest payable to the members of the 
exempted trust shall not be lower than the statutory rate 
of interest declared by the Central Government under the 
Employees Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions 
Act, 1952 and shortfall, if any, shall be made good by 
the Bank.
The guidance note on implementing AS-15, Employee 
Benefits, states that benefits involving employer established 
provident funds, which require interest shortfalls to be 
provided, are to be considered as defined benefit plan. 
Actuarial valuation of this Provident Fund interest shortfall 
is done as per the guidance note issued in this respect by 
The Institute of Actuaries of India (IAI) and provision towards 
this liability is made.
The overseas branches of the Bank make contribution to the 
respective applicable government social security scheme 
calculated as a percentage of the employees’ salaries. 
The Bank’s obligations are limited to these contributions, 
which are expensed when due, as such contribution is in 
the nature of defined contribution.
Pension:
In respect of pension payable to certain eLKB employees 
under the Lord Krishna Bank (Employees) Pension 
Scheme, which is a defined benefit scheme, the Bank 
contributes 10% of basic salary to a pension trust set up 
by the Bank and administered by the Board of Trustees and 
an additional amount towards the liability shortfall based on 
an independent actuarial valuation as at the Balance Sheet 
date, which includes assumptions about demographics, 
early retirement, salary increases and interest rates.
In respect of certain eLKB employees who had moved to 
a Cost to Company (CTC) based compensation structure 
and had completed less than 15 years of service, the 
contribution which was made until then, is maintained as a 
fund and will be converted into annuity on separation after a 
lock-in-period of two years. For this category of employees, 
liability stands frozen and no additional provision is required 
except for interest as applicable to Provident Fund, which 
is provided for.
In respect of certain eLKB employees who moved to a CTC 
structure and had completed service of more than 15 years, 
pension would be paid on separation based on salary 
applicable as on the date of movement to CTC structure. 
Provision thereto is made based on an independent 
actuarial valuation as at the Balance Sheet date.
National Pension Scheme (NPS):
In respect of employees who opt for contribution to the 
NPS, the Bank contributes certain percentage of the basic 
salary of employees to the aforesaid scheme, a defined 
contribution plan, which is managed and administered by 
pension fund management companies. The Bank has no 
liability other than its contribution, and recognises such 
contributions as an expense in the year incurred.
HDFC Securities Limited
Short term
Short term employee benefits include salaries and 
performance incentives. A liability is recognised for the 
amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus 
or target based incentives if the Company has a present 
legal or informal obligation to pay this amount as a result of 
past service provided by the employee, and the obligation 
can be estimated reliably. These costs are recognised as an 
expense in the Profit and Loss Account at the undiscounted 
amount expected to be paid over the period of services 
rendered by the employees to the Company.
Post-employment
The Company offers its employees long term benefits by 
way of defined-contribution and defined-benefit plans, of 
which some have assets in special funds or securities. The 
plans are financed by the Company and in the case of 
some defined contribution plans by the Company along 
with its employees.
Defined-contribution plans
These are plans in which the Company pays pre-defined 
amounts to separate funds and does not have any legal 
or informal obligation to pay additional sums. These 
comprise of contributions to the National Pension Scheme, 
Employees’ Provident Fund, Family Pension Fund and 
Superannuation Fund. The Company’s payments to the 

defined-contribution plans are reported as expenses during 
the period in which the employees perform the services 
that the payment covers.
Defined-benefit plans
Expenses for defined-benefit gratuity plan are calculated 
as at the Balance Sheet date by an independent actuary 
in a manner that distributes expenses over the employee’s 
working life. These commitments are valued at the present 
value of the expected future payments, with consideration 
for calculated future salary increases, using a discount rate 
corresponding to the interest rate estimated by the actuary 
having regard to the interest rate on government bonds with 
a remaining term that is almost equivalent to the average 
balance working period of employees. The fair values of 
the plan assets are deducted in determining the net liability. 
When the fair value of plan assets exceeds the commitments 
computed as aforesaid, the recognised asset is limited to 
the net total of any cumulative past service costs and the 
present value of any economic benefits available in the form 
of reductions in future contributions to the plan. 
Actuarial losses or gains are recognised in the Profit and 
Loss Account in the year in which they arise.
Other long term employee benefits
Compensated absences which accrue to employees and 
which can be carried to future periods and are expected 
to be availed in more than twelve months immediately 
following the year in which the employee has rendered 
service are reported as expenses during the year in which 
the employees perform the services that the benefit covers 
and the liabilities are reported at the undiscounted amount 
of the benefits. 
Share-based payment transactions
The cost of equity-settled instrument is determined by 
the fair value at the date when the grant is made using 
an appropriate valuation model.
That cost is recognised, together with a corresponding 
increase in share-based payment reserves in equity, 
over the period in which the performance and / 
or service conditions are fulfilled. The cumulative 
expense recognised for equity-settled transactions 
at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects 
the extent to which the vesting period has expired and 
the Company’s best estimate of the number of equity 
instruments that will ultimately vest.
When the terms of an equity-settled award are 
modified, the minimum expense recognised is the 
expense had the terms had not been modified, if the 
original terms of the award are met. An additional 
expense is recognised for any modification that 
increases the total fair value of the share-based 
payment transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the 
employee as measured at the date of modification. 
Where an award is cancelled by the entity or by the 
counter-party, any remaining element of the fair value 
of the award is expensed immediately through the 
Profit and Loss Account.
HDB Financial Services Limited 
Gratuity
The Company provides for gratuity to all employees. The 
benefit is in the form of lump sum payments to vested 
employees on resignation, retirement, or death while 
in employment or on termination of employment of an 
amount equivalent to 15 days basic salary payable for 
each completed year of service. Vesting occurs upon 
completion of five years of service. The Company makes 
annual contributions to fund administered by trustees and 
managed by insurance companies, for amounts notified 
by the said insurance companies. The defined benefit 
plan are valued by an independent external actuary as 
at the Balance Sheet date using the projected unit credit 
method to determine the present value of defined benefit 
obligation and the related service costs. Under this method, 
the determination is based on actuarial calculations, which 
include assumptions about demographics, early retirement, 
salary increases and interest rates. Actuarial gain or loss is 
recognised in the Profit and Loss Account.
Provident fund
In accordance with the applicable law, all employees of 
the Company are entitled to receive benefits under the 
Provident Fund Act, 1952. The Company contributes an 
amount, on a monthly basis, at a determined rate to the 
Pension Scheme administered by the Regional Provident 
Fund Commissioner ('RPFC') and the Company has no 
liability for future provident fund benefits other than its 
annual contribution. Since it is a defined contribution plan, 
the contributions are accounted for on an accrual basis and 
recognised in the Profit and Loss Account.
Employee Stock Option Plan
The Company has adopted fair value method for options 
granted post March 31, 2021. All the options granted if any 
prior to March 31, 2021 are valued at intrinsic value method. 
Compensation cost is measured by the excess, if any, of the 
fair value of the underlying stock over the exercise price as 
determined under the option plan. The fair value of options 
have been estimated on the dates of each grant using the 
Black-Scholes model. The compensation cost is amortised 
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the option 
with a corresponding credit to Employee Stock Options 
Reserve. On exercise of the stock options, corresponding

Debit and credit cards reward points
HDFC Bank Limited
The Bank estimates the probable redemption of debit 
and credit card reward points and cost per point using an 
actuarial method by employing an independent actuary, 
which includes assumptions such as mortality, redemption 
and spends. Provisions for liabilities on the outstanding 
reward points are made based on an independent actuarial 
valuation as at the Balance Sheet date and included in 
other liabilities and provisions.
11 Bullion
HDFC Bank Limited
The Bank imports bullion including precious metal bars on 
a consignment basis. The imports are typically on a backto-back basis and are priced to the customer based on 
the price quoted by the supplier. The difference between 
the price recovered from customers and cost of bullion 
is accounted at the time of sale to the customers and 
reported as “Other Income’’.
The Bank also deals in bullion on a borrowing and lending 
basis and the interest thereon is accounted as interest 
expense / income respectively.

Lease accounting
Lease payments including cost escalation for assets taken 
on operating lease are recognised in the Profit and Loss 
Account over the lease term on a straight-line basis in 
accordance with the AS-19, Leases.

Income tax
Income tax expense comprises current tax provision (i.e. 
the amount of tax for the period determined in accordance 
with the Income Tax Act, 1961, the rules framed there 
under and considering the material principles set out in 
Income Computation and Disclosure Standards) and the 
net change in the deferred tax asset or liability during the 
year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for 
the future tax consequences of timing differences between 
the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their 
respective tax bases, and operating loss carried forward, 
if any. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using 
the enacted or substantively enacted tax rates as at the 
Balance Sheet date. 
Current tax assets and liabilities and deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are off-set when they relate to income taxes 
levied by the same taxation authority, when the entity has 
a legal right to off-set and when the entity intends to settle 
on a net basis.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent there 
is reasonable certainty that the assets can be realised 
in future. In case of unabsorbed depreciation or carried 
forward loss under taxation laws, deferred tax assets are 
recognised only if there is virtual certainty of realisation 
of such assets. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each 
Balance Sheet date and appropriately adjusted to reflect the 
amount that is reasonably / virtually certain to be realised.

Earnings per share
The Group reports basic and diluted earnings per equity 
share in accordance with AS-20, Earnings per Share. Basic 
earnings per equity share has been computed by dividing 
net profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders by 
the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding 
for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential 
dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to 
issue equity shares were exercised or converted to equity 
during the year. Diluted earnings per equity share are 
computed using the weighted average number of equity 
shares and the dilutive potential equity shares outstanding 
during the period except where the results are anti-dilutive.
15 Share issue expenses
HDFC Bank Limited
Share issue expenses are adjusted against Share Premium 
Account in terms of Section 52 of the Companies Act, 2013.

Segment information 
The disclosure relating to segment information is in 
accordance with AS-17, Segment Reporting and as per 
guidelines issued by RBI.
17 Accounting for provisions, contingent liabilities and 
contingent assets
In accordance with AS-29, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities 
and Contingent Assets, the Group recognises provisions 
when it has a present obligation as a result of a past event, 
it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation 
and when a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation 
can be made. 
Provisions are determined based on management estimate 
required to settle the obligation at the Balance Sheet date, 
supplemented by experience of similar transactions. These 
are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and adjusted to 
reflect the current management estimates. 
A disclosure of contingent liability is made when there is:
a possible obligation arising from a past event, the 
existence of which will be confirmed by the occurrence 
or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future 
events not within the control of the Group; or

a present obligation arising from a past event which 
is not recognised as it is not probable that an outflow 
of resources will be required to settle the obligation 
or a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation 
cannot be made.
When there is a possible obligation or a present obligation 
in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of resources 
is remote, no provision or disclosure is made. Contingent 
assets, if any, are not recognised in the financial statements 
since this may result in the recognition of income that may 
never be realised.

Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents include cash including 
foreign currency notes and gold in hand, balances with 
RBI, balances with other banks and money at call and

Contingent liability*
Brief description

Claims against 
the Group not 
acknowledged as 
debts - taxation
The Group is a party to various taxation matters in respect of which appeals are pending. The Group 
expects the outcome of the appeals to be favorable based on decisions on similar issues in the previous 
years by the appellate authorities, based on the facts of the case and taxation laws. 

Claims against 
the Group not 
acknowledged as

Contingent liability*
Brief description

Liability on account of 
forward exchange and 
derivative contracts
The Group enters into foreign exchange contracts, currency options, forward rate agreements, currency 
swaps and interest rate swaps with inter-bank participants on its own account and for customers. Forward 
exchange contracts are commitments to buy or sell foreign currency at a future date at the contracted rate. 
Currency swaps are commitments to exchange cash flows by way of interest / principal in one currency 
against another, based on predetermined rates. Interest rate swaps are commitments to exchange 
fixed and floating interest rate cash flows. The notional amounts of financial instruments such as foreign 
exchange contracts and derivatives provide a basis for comparison with instruments recognised on the 
Balance Sheet but do not necessarily indicate the amounts of future cash flows involved or the current 
fair value of the instruments and, therefore, do not indicate the Bank’s exposure to credit or price risks. 
The derivative instruments become favorable (assets) or unfavorable (liabilities) as a result of fluctuations in 
market rates or prices relative to their terms.

Guarantees given on 
behalf of constituents, 
acceptances, 
endorsements and 
other obligations
As a part of its commercial banking activities, the Bank issues documentary credit and guarantees on 
behalf of its customers. Documentary credits such as letters of credit enhance the credit standing of 
the Bank’s customers. Guarantees generally represent irrevocable assurances that the Bank will make 
payments in the event of the customer failing to fulfill its financial or performance obligations.

Other items for 
which the Group is 
contingently liable
These include: a) Credit enhancements in respect of securitised-out loans; b) Bills rediscounted by the 
Bank; c) Capital commitments; d) Underwriting commitments; 
e) Investment purchases pending settlement; f) Amount transferred to the RBI under the Depositor 
Education and Awareness Fund (DEAF).

The Bank has not acquired any Special Mention Account.
The RBI Master Direction on Transfer of Loan Exposures dated September 24, 2021 has mandated disclosure of 
transfer of loan assets. Considering the terms ‘loans not in default’ and ‘special mention account’ under this circular 
vis-à-vis loans termed as ‘standard’ as hitherto and the separate processes prescribed therein for transfer of such 
assets, the Bank believes that such disclosure would be more meaningful if disclosed prospectively and therefore 
transfer of loan exposures prior to September 24, 2021, are not considered relevant for disclosure.

Amortisation of expenditure on account of enhancement in family pension of employees of banks
The Reserve Bank of India, vide its notification dated October 04, 2021 granted Banks an option to amortise the expenditure 
on account of enhancement of family pension, over a period not exceeding five years beginning with the financial year ending 
March 31, 2022, subject to a minimum of one-fifth of the total amount involved being expensed every year. The Bank has not 
availed the said option and has recognised the entire expenditure on account of enhancement of family pension in financial 
year ended March 31, 2022.
 
Provident fund
The guidance note on AS-15, Employee Benefits, states that employer established provident funds, where interest is guaranteed 
are to be considered as defined benefit plans and the liability has to be valued. The Institute of Actuaries of India (IAI) has issued 
a guidance note on valuation of interest rate guarantees on exempt provident funds. The actuary has accordingly valued the 
same and the Bank held a provision of Nil as at March 31, 2023 (previous year: Nil), towards the present value of the guaranteed 
interest benefit obligation. The actuary has followed the deterministic approach as prescribed by the guidance note.

Commodity Price Risks and Foreign Exchange 
Risks and Hedging activities
Being in the business of banking, as per the extant regulations, 
the Bank does not deal in any commodity, though, it can be 
exposed to the commodity price risks in its capacity as lender / 
banker to its customers. Currently, the Bank has open exposure 
in Precious Metals i.e, Gold / Silver and such open exposures in 
Gold / Silver are primarily on account of positions created from 
short term deposits under the Gold Monetisation Scheme (GMS) 
raised from Customers and trading positions in Gold / Silver. 
These positions are managed similar to other foreign exchange 
exposures using spot, outright forwards and swap transactions 
in Gold/Silver and monitored as part of the trading portfolio within 
the stipulated trading risk limits viz. Net overnight open position 
limit, Intraday open position limit, Value-at-Risk limit, Stop Loss 
Trigger Level etc. that are defined in the Treasury Limits Package. 
In addition, Bank is authorized by Reserve Bank of India to 
import gold and silver and the exposure arising out of import 
of gold and silver on consignment basis is covered on back to 
back basis. The spot, forward and swap contracts, outstanding 
as on the Balance Sheet date and held for trading, are revalued 
at the closing spot and forward rates respectively as notified by 
FEDAI (Foreign Exchange Dealers’ Association of India) and at 
interpolated rates for contracts of interim maturities. The USD/ 
INR rate for valuation of contracts having longer maturities i.e. 
greater than one (1) year is implied from the applicable INR and 
USD swap curves. For other pairs, where the rates / tenors 
are not published by FEDAI, the spot and forward points are 
obtained from Refinitiv or Bloomberg for valuation of the foreign

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emissions? If Yes, then provide details.
£ Yes, the Bank remains committed to implementing meaningful and system-driven changes to reduce the greenhouse gas 
(GHG) intensity of our operations. To achieve this, we have adopted firm-level guidelines for operations and procurement, 
focusing on both supply-side and demand-side interventions. On the demand side, we have successfully implemented 
Smart IoT systems and other measures to reduce emissions. Innovative technologies have enhanced energy efficiency 
and we are on the path to reducing our footprint in line with carbon neutrality strategy. On the supply side, we have 
taken steps to promote renewable energy adoption. We have installed solar panels on our office buildings and procured 
renewable electricity, leading to savings of approximately 1799 tCO2 emissions. By prioritizing renewable sources, we 
are actively working towards a more sustainable energy mix.
 
As a responsible bank, we prioritize paper waste reduction and tree plantation within our value chain. Through our digital 
solutions and process automation, we have significantly reduced paper waste generation. As part of our green event 
guidelines we have conserved approximately 33.10 Lakh square feet of paper. Our ambitious tree plantation initiative 
has successfully planted over 30 lakh trees, reducing GHG emissions and enhancing our social and relationship capital. 
By digitizing processes, we enable customers to minimize visits to physical locations, reducing associated emissions. 
Where paper use is necessary, we utilize recycled paper to lower our ecological footprint. Despite a 13% increase in our 
customer base, FY23 saw emissions rise by 14%, underscoring our unwavering commitment to sustainability.

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your 
company to reduce the usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted 
to manage such wastes.
The Bank is actively working towards sustainable waste management by implementing a policy that prioritizes segregation, 
recycling, and safe handling of waste. We have successfully implemented a recycling program for e-waste, paper waste, 
food waste, plastic waste, and other non-hazardous waste in 16 offices. The disposal of owned IT assets resulted in 88.15 
metric tonnes of e-waste, which is responsibly disposed through authorized recyclers. The Bank plans to progressively 
expand waste-tracking facilities and increase coverage over the next few years. Hazardous waste generated from DG 
sets and DG oil is disposed off using approved vendors.

shares in demat mode are requested to update with their 
respective Depository Participants, their correct core banking 
account number, including 9 digit MICR Code and 11 digit 
IFSC Code, e-mail ID and Mobile No(s). This will facilitate the 
remittance of the dividend amount as directed by SEBI directly 
in the bank account electronically. Updation of e-mail IDs and 
Mobile No(s) will also enable sending communication relating to 
credit of dividend, unencashed dividend etc.
Shareholders holding shares in physical form may communicate 
details relating to their core banking account, viz., core banking 
account number, including 9 digit MICR Code and 11 digit IFSC 
Code, e-mail ID and Mobile No(s) to the Registrars & Transfer

Deduction of tax at source on dividend
In terms of the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961, (“the Act”), 
dividend paid or distributed by a Company on or after April 1, 
2020 is taxable in the hands of the shareholders. The Company 
shall therefore be required to deduct tax at source at the time 
of payment of dividend. The deduction of tax at source will be 
based on the category of shareholders and subject to fulfilment 
of conditions as provided herein below:
For Resident shareholders
Tax will be deducted at source (“TDS”) under Section 194 of the 
Act @ 10% on the amount of dividend payable unless exempt 
under any of the provisions of the Act. However, in case of 
resident shareholders, TDS would not apply if the aggregate of 
total dividend distributed/paid to them by the Company during 
a financial year does not exceed Rs.5,000/-.
Tax will not be deducted at source in cases where a shareholder 
provides Form 15G (applicable to all individuals) / Form 15H 
(applicable to an individual above the age of 60 years), provided 
that the eligibility conditions are satisfied. Blank Form 15G and 
15H can be downloaded from the link given at the end of this 
communication. Please note that all fields mentioned in the Form 

are mandatory and the Bank may reject the forms submitted, if 
they do not fulfil the requirement of the law.

following resident shareholders on submission of self-declaration

of Section 195 and section 196D of the Act at applicable rates 
in force. As per the relevant provisions of the Act, the tax shall
