Powering

Bank has created a stronger financial services 
conglomerate with the addition of subsidiaries like 
HDFC Life, HDFC ERGO and HDFC AMC. This 
has opened up a fresh pathway for future growth 
through the ownership of a reputed home loan 
product, thereby enhancing our ability to serve 
customers better and tap into opportunities for 
cross-sell. Thus, the merger further fortifies our 
position in the market.

A B O U T T H E R E P O R T
The Integrated Annual Report for 
FY 2023-24 offers a comprehensive 
overview of HDFC Bank’s (referred to as 
‘We’, ‘Us’, or ‘the Bank’) journey in fulfilling 
its purpose, demonstrating how the 
Bank generates value for stakeholders, 
including customers, shareholders, 
investors, regulators, employees, and 
society. The merger of HDFC Bank 
and erstwhile HDFC Ltd represents a 
significant milestone, creating a robust 
entity positioned to influence India’s 
growth trajectory. This commitment 
underscores the Bank’s value creation 
narrative and its broader impact. Beyond 
financial metrics, the report delves 
into non-financial performance, risks, 
opportunities, strategic priorities, and 
sustainability efforts. Additionally, it also 
provides insights into the governance 
and risk management framework that 
underpins the Bank’s performance.
Reporting Principles and 
Framework
The financial information presented in this 
report is in line with the requirements of
• The Companies Act, 2013 (including 
the rules made thereunder)
• The Companies (Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2006
• The Securities and Exchange 
Board of India (Listing Obligations 
and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015
• The Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and 
other relevant RBI regulations
The report has been prepared in 
alignment with the <IR> framework 
prescribed by the IFRS Foundation and 
also contains disclosures with reference 
to GRI Standards 2021, Task Force on 
Climate related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD), Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report (BRSR), BRSR 
Core and United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals (UN SDGs). The Bank 
is committed to the improvement of data 
quality, continuous adoption of evolving 
guidance against reporting standards 
and learning from industry practices. This 
endeavor has prompted some necessary 
restatements to the historical data shared 
in the report. Significant restatements 
are highlighted and explained in the 
notes accompanying the relevant KPIs, 
providing stakeholders with detailed 
information about the reasons for and 
implications of these adjustments.
Materiality and Scope
This report includes information which is 
material to all stakeholders of the Bank 
and provides an overview of its business 
and related activities. The report discloses 
matters that substantially impact or affect 
the Bank’s ability to create value and 
could influence decisions of providers of 
financial capital. In FY23, we conducted 
a materiality assessment in accordance 
with the updated GRI Standards 2021. In 
FY24, the material matters thus identified 
were reviewed and refreshed to integrate 
the concept of double materiality. These 
reprioritised matters now represent topics

their financial significance to our business 
but also in terms of potential impacts on 
the planet and the society. For GRI topics

Reporting Boundary

report covers the activities and progress 
of the Bank on a standalone basis.

Holdings Limited ("eHDFC Holdings"), 
merged with and into erstwhile Housing 
Development Finance Corporation 
Limited (“eHDFC Limited”) and thereafter 
eHDFC Limited merged with and into

methodologies/assumptions with respect 
to scope 1 emissions, which are different 
than those adopted in the previous

been given to explain the same under the

As a result of the merger and changes 
as mentioned above, the non-financial 
information of the Bank for the year ended 
March 31, 2024 is not comparable with 
that of the previous financial year.

Network
O U R P R E S E N C E
Our nationwide distribution network 
spans metro, urban, semi-urban and 
rural areas. Through our strategically 
positioned 8,738 branches, we 
not only bolster customer service 
but also broaden accessibility in 
previously underserved markets. 
Our overseas branches are tailored 
specifically to meet the needs of 
Non-Resident Indian (NRI) customers. 
Further, the merger strengthens our 
geographic coverage by integrating 
HDFC Limited's footprint with the 
Bank’s pan India network, ensuring 
comprehensive service across 
the country.
The Bank’s network encompasses 
branches, Business Correspondents 
(BCs), ATMs and Cash Recycler 
Machines. The physical presence, 
the digital platforms and innovative 
products come together to offer 
seamless banking experiences. The 
Bank is aligned with the Government's 
Digital Banking Units Initiative (DBUs) 
to extend efficient, secure, paperless 
banking services to remote areas. 
We have established four DBUs in 
Haridwar, Chandigarh, Faridabad, 
and South 24 Parganas, West Bengal. 
These units offer a human touch, 
fostering trust and connectivity 
within communities.
HDFC Bank's investments in its distribution network 
underscores the significance of these for granular and 
sustainable funding into the future. This is evident through 
the observed geometric progression in deposit mobilisation 
over the tenure of each branch. Moreover, the Bank believes 
that physical presence will be a key factor in customer 
engagement, even as digitalisation becomes ubiquitous. 
Therefore, we envision our branches evolving into 
experience hubs facilitating deeper customer relationships 
and enhancing the overall banking experience.

A Year of Synergy, Resilience and Growth 
Dear Stakeholders,
Greetings!
It gives me immense pleasure to 
present to you the Integrated Annual 
Report of your Bank for the Financial 
Year 2023-24.
I would like to congratulate my fellow 
Board members, the entire team of 
the Bank and erstwhile HDFC Limited 
for having accomplished one of the 
most complex mergers in the financial 
services industry by completing the 
process in a very seamless, efficient 
and effective manner. I am grateful for 
the support of Government of India, the 
Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Securities 
and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), 
Competition Commission of India (CCI), 
Insurance Regulatory and Development 
Authority of India (IRDAI), the stock 
exchanges and other regulatory 
authorities for providing their approvals 
and guidance during the entire process.
The merger has further strengthened 
our position as a leading financial 
conglomerate of India and our Bank 
is now the custodian of the venerated 
HDFC brand that was created and 
nurtured by the late Mr. H T Parekh, 
Mr. Deepak Parekh and capable and 
eminent members of his team.
Economy Growing at a 
Rapid Pace and Showing 
Great Resilience
The Indian economy as well as your 
Bank have demonstrated resilience in a 
world characterised by headwinds and 
uncertainties. The sound policies and 
timely interventions of RBI have ensured 
that we were well prepared for the 
monetary tightening that happened in 
the developed world after the inflationary 
pressures manifested themselves across 
the globe. The Bank has responded 
to the evolving liquidity scenario 
and calibrated its response over the 
past year.
The financial year gone by has seen 
the GDP in India grow at 8.2 per cent 
while global GDP growth was 3.2 per 
cent in 2023. We continue to remain the 
world’s fastest growing major economy, 
with GDP growth projected at 7.2 per 
cent in the current financial year. This 
has come about despite a slowdown 
in global growth. The GDP growth has 
been supported by a boost in capital 
expenditure, particularly in infrastructure 
development, including roads, highways, 
railways and housing. Between FY22 
and FY24, overall capex growth in the 
economy stood at 11.0 per cent on an 
average with government doing the 
heavy lifting. Private sector investment 
also showed some signs of resurgence 
in sectors such as cement, steel, and 
oil and gas. Growth has also received 
a fillip through a rise in manufacturing 
and construction activity. This has been 
due to a combination of lower input 
costs, Government support to the Micro, 
Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) 
sector through Emergency Credit Line 
Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) and large 
scale manufacturing through schemes 
like Production Linked Incentive (PLI).
Overall, the past fiscal year has shown 
strong macroeconomic fundamentals 
of the country. However, slowdown 
in household savings has put a strain 
on liquidity across the economy. Your 
Bank has been well placed to obtain 
the benefits of this growth and has 
actively funded the small and medium 
enterprises that form the backbone of 
the economy as well retail consumers, 
managing well within the constraints 
of liquidity and elevated costs of 
incremental funding.
Reaping Synergies 
of the Merger
As we complete one year of the merger, 
I am happy to note that the process 
of integration has been completed 
seamlessly and efficiently across 
all dimensions of the business and 
customer services and we have put 
in place robust risk management 
and compliance functions from a 
supervisory perspective for the Bank 
and the subsidiaries, which now cover 
a substantially large footprint in the 
financial services domain. The synergies 
of the merger are being manifested 
through the combined strengths of the 
two merged entities, the home loan 
expertise of erstwhile HDFC Limited 
and the extensive distribution franchise 
of HDFC Bank. Today, most of our 
branches are selling home loans, 
including those in semi urban and 
rural locations. As the nation's growth 
story unfolds, we stand prepared 
to reap the benefits through this 
historic combination.
HDFC Bank Limited

Financial Performance 
and Beyond
HDFC Bank's financial performance in 
the past year demonstrated resilience 
amidst challenges, with market share 
growth in deposits as well as advances. 
The Bank ensured prudent risk 
management and asset quality across 
portfolios. Its profit after tax grew by 
37.9 per cent to H60,812.3 crore on 
a standalone post-merger basis. A 
comprehensive view of our performance 
is captured in the report placed 
before you.
Governance
As a fully Board governed entity with no 
promoter, the weight of responsibility 
is on us to ensure best standards of 
governance to look after the interests 
of shareholders, depositors, employees 
and other stakeholders. As a responsible 
financial institution, we strive to create 
sustained value for all our stakeholders 
without compromising on our core 
values of Customer Focus, Operational 
Excellence, Product Leadership, People 
and Sustainability in our day-to-day 
operations. These values continue 
to be upheld as we keep maintaining 
stringent standards of corporate 
governance, placing significant 
emphasis on fundamental principles 
such as independence, accountability, 
responsibility, transparency and 
timely disclosure.
Throughout the year, the Board 
Committee meetings were convened 
regularly, playing a pivotal role in 
assessing critical areas of the Bank's 
governance. These Committees facilitate 
the governance and supervisory 
responsibilities of the Board members 
as they provide oversight and feedback 
on critical areas and the performance of 
the management of the Bank. Cognisant 
of our status as a large financial 
conglomerate we have also put in place 
group level oversight of compliance 
and risk management of the diverse 
subsidiaries, while at the same time 
making their respective management 
teams accountable for governance 
and compliance.
During the year Mr. Sashidhar Jagdishan 
was reappointed as the Managing 
Director and Chief Executive Officer 
of the Bank with effect from October 
27, 2023. Mr. Kaizad M Bharucha, was 
elevated as Deputy Managing Director 
of the Bank w.e.f. April 19, 2023. 
Mr. Bhavesh Zaveri and Mr. V. Srinivasa 
Rangan were appointed as Executive 
Directors to the Board with effect from 
April 19, 2023 and November 23, 
2023 respectively.
Customer Experience 
and Building Technology 
for the Future
In the evolving banking landscape 
with fast changing technology, our 
unwavering focus remains on our 
customers and our commitment to 
enhancing customer experiences and 
obtaining increased share of their wallet 
through innovation and technology. 
Over the last year, we have achieved 
significant milestones with key products, 
services and innovations backed 
by robust technology infrastructure, 
reinforcing our dedication to digital 
transformation and fully embracing 
digital banking. The achievements on 
our digital banking initiatives highlight 
our commitment to delivering world 
class and secure banking services, 
ensuring the safety and trust of our 
customers, and making technology our 
key competitive differentiator. We are 
committed to providing personalised 
solutions and ensuring banking services 
are inclusive and accessible to the wide 
spectrum of our society.
Social Value Creation
While the merger with erstwhile HDFC 
Limited has been the core focus during 
the year under review, it is equally 
important to reiterate the strides our 
Bank has made in our continuing 
commitment to Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) and social value 
creation. Given the large scale of our 
operations and strong profitability, 
we recognise the criticality of giving 
back to the very communities in which 
we operate.
Economic and financial wellbeing of 
society is what every responsible lender 
should aspire for. Our commitment to 
this principle is underscored in our CSR 
programme. Our core focus areas are 
Rural Development, Education, Skilling 
and Livelihood, Healthcare and Financial 
Literacy and Inclusion. Our Bank has 
cumulatively impacted over 10 crore lives 
through our social initiatives.
As a Bank, we also stand resolute with 
the government in its endeavour to 
promote financial inclusion. The CSR 
programme of your Bank supplements 
the government’s flagship welfare 
schemes aimed at improving the 
lives of farmers, protecting vulnerable 
segments of society through micro 
insurance, pensions, loans to MSMEs 
and urban and rural livelihood initiatives, 
amongst others.
As a large financier, we understand the 
need to align with the country’s strategy 
towards decarbonisation. The Board of 
your Bank increased oversight on ESG 
disclosures and climate-related risks as 
well as keeping abreast with evolving 
regulatory frameworks.
In Conclusion
I extend my sincere thanks to all our 
stakeholders for their continued support, 
and most of all, to the large HDFC Bank 
family of over two hundred thousand 
people. Needless to say, it is the 
collective passion and commitment of 
all that will allow us to achieve the future 
growth of the institution.
Warm regards,

Merger Synergies Playing Out
Dear Shareholders,
Warm greetings to you all.
The year gone by was one of both, 
continuity and change. Continuity, as 
India remained the fastest growing 
major economy in the world; change, 
as there was a transformational 
merger between parent, HDFC Limited 
and HDFC Bank. I feel fortunate to 
be a part of the Indian economy 
right now, which is teeming with 
opportunities. As per the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF), India will 
continue to be a driver for global 
growth in the foreseeable future. 
Last year, as you’re aware, we 
concluded the merger of HDFC 
Limited with the Bank, a momentous 
event in the organisation’s history. 
Your Bank worked on fortifying 
all aspects of the merger, during 
the nine months of Financial Year 
2023-24 spent as a merged entity. 
The successful conclusion of the 
merger and seamless integration of 
the entities have further added to 
my confidence in the organisation’s 
resilience and pride in the execution 
capability of the team at HDFC Bank 
and HDFC Limited, which is now part 
of the Bank. 
With our financial discipline, prudent 
investment in technology and a 
passionate commitment to customer 
centricity, I’m pleased to report 
that your Bank has performed well 
in a year that witnessed such a 
significant development.

Macroeconomic 
Environment
Global GDP growth moderated in 
2023 to 3.2 per cent from 3.5 per 
cent amid monetary tightening in 
developed economies, geopolitical 
tensions in parts of the globe and 
rising commodity prices. The Indian 
economy bucked this trend and 
recorded a growth of 8.2 per cent in 
Financial Year 2023-24 from a growth 
rate of 7.0 per cent in the previous 
financial year - the highest among 
major economies. 
The country’s GDP growth averaged 
8.3 per cent annually over the last 
three fiscal years, the highest in 
the Asia-Pacific region. This was 
supported by a capital expenditure 
boost (particularly in infrastructure 
development, including roads, 
railways, and housing), moderating 
inflation, strong manufacturing 
performance and healthy consumer 
demand, especially in urban areas.
Overall credit growth has been in 
double digits since April 2022. Higher 
demand for consumer durables and 
greater retail spends have boosted 
retail credit growth. Retail loans have 
increased at a CAGR of 19 per cent 
over the last five years, outpacing the 
growth in nominal GDP. During this 
period, the RBI has issued advisory 
to banks on strengthening the 
acquisition, monitoring and collection 
process as the unsecured loan growth 
has outpaced the overall loan growth. 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) 
anticipates India’s GDP growth to be 
at 7.2 per cent in Financial Year 202425. Economic activity is likely to be 
supported by further pick-up in private 
capital expenditure and continued 
Government capital spending. 
In addition, domestic consumer 
spending is expected to see further 
recovery particularly in rural areas.
Moreover, the benefit from 
Government reforms and support 
measures over the last few years, 
like the Production Linked Incentive 
(PLI) schemes is likely to boost 
manufacturing activity and attract 
FDI flows. Besides, a continued 
diversification of supply chains to 
newer emerging markets is likely to 
benefit investment flows into India. 
India is clearly in a good place 
for economic growth and we feel 
well placed to capitalise on the 
positive environment. 
The Merger
We’ve recently completed one year of 
the merger which formally came into 
effect on July 1, 2023. In many ways 
it is now a new organisation with a 
different balance sheet composition. 
For example, it has a higher proportion 
of borrowing at 21 per cent versus 
8 per cent pre-merger and a lower 
CASA ratio. Key metrics of the new 
organisation will be different than that 
of pre-merger levels. For us, this is 
HDFC Bank 2.0 that has to be seen 
differently, and comparing with the 
past in terms of metrics would not be 
the right way.
The merger has presented the Bank 
with a massive opportunity which 
we’re working to seize. India is 
today in the midst of unprecedented 
urbanisation, fuelled by rising incomes 
and aspirations cutting across metros 
and beyond. The real estate sector 
is expected to reach a market size 
of US$1 trillion by 2030, a significant 
increase from US$ 200 billion in 
2021, contributing 13 per cent to the 
country’s GDP by 2025.
The merger has opened up fresh 
vistas for growth through the 
mortgage business, not only through 
increase in home loan disbursals, 
but also by leveraging customer 
engagement with the cross-sell 
opportunities across the HDFC 
Bank Group.
Your Bank has exhibited robust and 
consistent double-digit, year-onyear growth across its Home Loan 
business for the first nine months, 
post the merger. On a sequential basis 
too, it has gained a leading position 
recording a growth of 4 per cent.
Pre-merger approximately 30 to 35 
per cent of incremental home loan 
disbursals were to customers with an 
HDFC Bank savings account. This 
has now touched approximately 85 
per cent of incremental disbursals in 
a space of just nine months. This has 
been possible due to the extensive 
distribution network of the Bank, 
seamless integration of bundled 
journeys and the execution capability 
of our teams on the ground, which I 
am really proud of. Our ability to build 
a strong liability franchise leveraging 
home loan customers is well on its 
way to fruition.
Our home loan customers also enjoy 
the benefit of a strong suite of financial 
products and solutions that the Bank 
can offer, like credit cards, consumer 
durable loans, wealth products, 
and insurance. This approach helps 
strengthen customer relationship and 
enables HDFC Bank emerge as the 
primary banker for these customers. 
While we have seen strong traction 
on savings accounts being opened 
along with home loans, we will now 
focus our energies on leveraging the 
cross-sell opportunity of both, the

Bank and the Group’s products to 
these customers, by way of seamless 
technology enabled customer journeys 
and a value proposition that attracts 
the customers. While we remain 
committed to an open architecture 
model, we do expect to distribute 
more of the subsidiaries investment 
and insurance products, leading to an 
increase in fee income.
We continue to spearhead several 
digital initiatives to enhance customer 
convenience and expedite the home 
loan process. Leveraging technology, 
these initiatives aim to streamline 
the process and ensure faster 
turnaround times.
All in all, the task of bringing together 
the leadership teams, technology 
infrastructures, and cultures of the two 
entities has been successful, allowing 
us to pursue our organisation goals as 
one team. 
Our Performance
Your Bank grew in the last financial 
year while continuing to demonstrate 
its traditional balance sheet resilience. 
The figures for the period ended 
March 31, 2024 include the operations 
of erstwhile HDFC Limited, which 
amalgamated with and into HDFC 
Bank on July 01, 2023 and hence 
the comparisons with the previous 
periods have to be looked at in light of 
the same.
On a standalone basis the Profit After 
Tax (PAT) for the year ended March 31, 
2024 was H60,812.3 crore, up by 37.9 
per cent over the year ended March 
31, 2023. Net Interest Income (NII) for 
the year ended March 31, 2024 was 
H1,08, 532 crore up 25.0 per cent over 
the year ended March 31, 2023. The 
figure crossed the Rupee one trillion 
mark for the first time in the Bank’s 
history. Core Net Interest Margin stood 
at 3.53 per cent and Gross NPAs at 
1.24 per cent. 
There has been a lot of discussion 
around our Net Interest Margin (NIM) 
and credit to deposit ratio post our 
merger as well as the path we would 
pursue, given the scale of deposit 
mobilisation required for our growth 
needs. Post the merger, we are 
looking at a very different liability 
profile. We are clear in our intent of 
pursuing profitable growth. The Bank 
will continue to focus on granular 
deposit mobilisation leveraging 
our inherent distribution strengths 
and the execution focus that we 
are known for. It is our endeavour 
to bring down the credit to deposit 
ratio to pre-merger levels and our 
focus would be to maintain adequate 
liquidity buffers, repayment of eHDFC 
borrowings as and when they mature, 
including weighing any prepayment 
opportunities that may arise, and 
pursuing profitable sources of lending. 
During this time of adjustment, the 
Bank would grow its advances a 
little slower than the deposit growth. 
We will avoid pursuing growth which 
does not meet our risk adjusted 
profitability thresholds, in line with the 
Bank’s philosophy. 
Technology Update 
I have been consistently sharing 
updates with you on my key focus 
areas - improving technology 
resilience, building for the future, and 
the three Cs: Culture, Conscience, 
and Customer. Let me now elaborate 
on these.
Technology has become the 
cornerstone of modern banking, 
driving innovation, security, efficiency, 
and new customer experiences. The 
Bank embraces technology's evolution 
into a growth catalyst through the 
‘Shift Right’ strategy. Our vision is to 
shift from a product-centric approach 
to a customer-centric one through five 
transformation pillars built on modern 
technology constructs.
With Journeys being a key enabler, 
the Bank now has over 30 acquisition 
journeys and 15 servicing journeys, 
including exciting launches such 
as FD booking, gold loan top-ups, 
and innovative home loan cross-sell 
offerings. Today, more than threequarters of our acquisitions are 
digitally driven, with straight-through 
processing leading to paperless 
experiences. Our state-of-the-art 
commercial loan origination engine 
facilitates in-principle approvals for 
customers within 30 minutes.
We are taking significant steps to 
transform our digital Channels into 
holistic platforms. Our indigenous 
mobile and net banking platforms 
are set to introduce a host of new 
experiences. In the past year, many of 
our platforms have gained significant 
traction. For instance, SmartWealth 
already has over 1,00,000 customers 
and Chat Banking through WhatsApp 
is the preferred channel with over 
90 lakh monthly interactions. On 
PayZapp, we now have more than 75 
lakh registered customers leveraging 
innovative features such as Tap to 
Pay and Swipe to Pay, whereas 
SmartHub Vyapar now has over 16 
lakh merchants. With our dedicated 
API Factory, we seek to build 
upon Banking as a Service (BaaS) 
capabilities, witnessing rapid adoption 
by large and medium corporates, thus 
expanding our footprint. CBX, our 
corporate banking platform, has now 
HDFC Bank Limited
2 2

scaled up to over 1,30,000 customers 
with more than 2 crore transactions in 
the previous month.
Core banking systems are being 
reinforced with further progress 
in our 'Hollow the Core' strategy 
towards modernised engineering for 
improved resilience and scale. We 
have also scaled up key systems to 
accommodate the further expansion 
of our branches and are increasing 
our hardware and infrastructure 
capacity by upgrading to a next-gen 
core platform. Additionally, we have 
deployed new platforms in retail 
assets and microfinance for increased 
resilience. We introduced a digital-only 
platform for credit cards, enabling us 
to launch PIXEL cards. In summary, 
we are reinforcing our core platforms 
across retail business landscape.
With Data as the focal point of our 
strategy, we have made substantial 
progress in our Data Lake initiative 
for improved data governance and 
quality. This will pave the way for a 
holistic reengineering of our enterprise 
customer database, furthering the 
‘Hollow the Core’ strategy. The Bank 
has taken multiple strides and is 
actively leveraging Artificial Intelligence 
(AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in 
areas such as fraud monitoring, risk 
management, credit decisioning 
and marketing analytics. This year 
saw the explosion of GenAI as a key, 
once-in-a-generation technology 
capability; and your Bank has been 
actively exploring use cases that 
could eventually prove instrumental 
in revolutionising areas like image 
recognition, language translation 
and statement analysis. We are also 
mindful of adopting these technologies 
within regulatory and security 
guardrails in a calibrated manner.
Having a stronger commitment 
than ever to Security, we have 
further bolstered our posture 
through frameworks such as Zero 
Trust Architecture for strengthened 
security and multi-layered defence 
mechanisms. Our Cyber Security 
Operations Center is now powered 
by an advanced AI/ML based 
platform, which can detect attack 
patterns with high accuracy. We are 
also advancing to adopt security 
engineering practices natively 
in our software engineering and 
development lifecycles.
I am proud to share that technology 
played a crucial role in ensuring a 
seamless merger despite substantial 
complexities. Integrating over 100 
applications through data migration 
and a multitude of backend system 
changes, the activity was fully 
managed and executed by in-house 
teams imbibing us with further 
confidence in our capabilities.
Looking ahead, I am excited about 
the opportunities that come our way 
as we continue our journey towards 
becoming a future-ready digital 
bank. Our commitment to delivering 
exceptional experiences and inclusive 
banking services will be driven by the 
adoption of new-age technologies 
focusing on scalability, resilience and 
security while building the bank for 
the future. 
Cyber Security
At HDFC Bank, cybersecurity and 
data privacy best practices are 
important priorities. The Bank remains 
committed to maintaining a secure 
cybersecurity posture to protect its 
technology, confidential information, 
data integrity, and business continuity. 
Our strong information security 
programme, security policies and 
processes are aligned with various 
information security management 
frameworks in the industry and 
provide necessary assurance 
on protecting the Bank’s critical 
information. It is an ongoing battle 
which requires continuous investment 
as the threat landscape is constantly 
evolving. 
Our deepest anguish is the threat 
landscape our customers face leading 
to compromise of their credentials and 
a financial loss. The Bank has invested 
in technology using AI and ML to 
arrest attempts at customers falling 
prey to scams and fraudsters. We urge 
customers to continue to be vigilant 
and follow safe banking practices, not 
allowing socially engineered fraud to 
succeed. The Bank has regularly been 
running Secure Banking campaigns 
through social media, SMS, Emails, 
ATMs, Bank website and various 
other channels. Your Bank’s Vigil 
Aunty campaign covering the various 
modus-operandi of fraudsters is one 
such example of awareness building. 
Further, we continue to collaborate 
with law enforcement agencies, 
regulatory authorities and peer 
banks to educate customers on safe 
banking practices. 
Customer Centricity 
My biggest priorities remain 
deep customer engagement and 
strengthening a Service First culture. 
Our implementation of Net Promoter 
System (NPS), branded as ‘Infinite 
Smiles’ programme has been one 
of the largest implementations in 
the world. This programme provides 
us with immediate and continuous 
customer feedback for us to listen, 
learn and act on the feedback,

across our entire suite of products 
and services. We have a robust 
governance framework in place to 
continuously listen to this feedback 
and take appropriate action. I am 
glad to report that compared to the 
last financial year we have an eight 
percentage points improvement in our 
NPS score. 
To further improve the Service First 
culture, we have instituted two 
key initiatives this year along with 
increasing the weightage of service 
in the performance measurement 
framework across all levels in 
the organisation. The first one is 
a structured intervention centre 
framework to continuously monitor 
our customer experience delivery 
across the customer life cycle. The 
response from our colleagues has 
been tremendous for this framework. 
We are seeing good improvements 
in getting the customer experience 
delivery right the first time as well as 
achieving faster turnaround times. The 
digitalisation of many of our service 
and acquisition journeys is also 
being increasingly adopted, both by 
employees and customers, resulting 
in further improvements. The second 
one is highly monitored coaching of 
our front end colleagues for deeper 
customer engagement. Whilst the 
initiatives have yielded results, we have 
a long way to go to reach a new orbit 
in Service First culture. 
People
I am proud to share with you the 
progress that we have made in 
our quest to be a more inclusive 
organisation. The year marked 
several milestones in this journey, an 
important one being our meeting and 
exceeding the threshold we had set 
for ourselves - that 25 per cent of our 
workforce should comprise women 
by 2025. Women representation in our 
workforce currently exceeds 55,000 
employees and has crossed 26 
per cent.
The Bank, like the rest of the BFSI 
sector, has experienced a volatile 
talent landscape in recent times. 
Attrition was a matter of concern for 
the Bank as it was for the industry in 
Financial Year 2022-23. However, in 
Financial year 2023-24, most of the 
industry has seen a slight moderation 
in the attrition rate and that is reflected 
in our numbers too. Nevertheless, in 
Financial Year 2023-24 the Bank has 
taken several efforts to arrest attrition, 
including setting up a task force at the 
highest level to identify the controllable 
causes and taking corrective action. 
Managers are the primary custodians 
of talent, and much effort has 
been made to raise awareness and 
accountability towards retention and 
engagement of their teams. Your Bank 
has invested in improving employee 
experience across various touch 
points along the employee lifecycle. 
This includes an enhanced onboarding 
experience, curated customised 
professional learning through Mpower 
(our learning experience platform) 
and an active listening framework, to 
stay connected with the pulse on the 
ground. As a result, in Financial Year 
2023-24, we saw a drop in new joiner 
attrition by 10 per cent over last year 
and the overall attrition drop by over 7 
per cent.
Your Bank continues to invest in 
upskilling its talent base of over 
2,00,000 employees. Employees are 
actively leveraging learning on a wide 
range of skills as well as emerging 
technologies, clocking over 65 lakh 
learning hours in Financial Year 202324. The year saw the introduction 
of an AI based learning experience 
platform for employees which enjoyed 
an adoption rate of 86 per cent in 
the first 30 days, getting off to a 
promising start.
Over the last few years, we have 
institutionalised Nurture, Care 
and Collaborate as a Managerial 
Behavioural Architecture. This has 
impacted the overall culture and 
employee experience as evidenced 
in the progressive positive shift in 
the employee sentiment scores over 
the last four years (75 per cent in 
Financial Year 2019-20 to 86 per cent 
in Financial Year 2023-24). Having said 
that, there is still much to be done and 
we are earnestly working on it to make 
this institution an even better place to 
work for.
The year gone by has been especially 
memorable for the Bank because 
we welcomed our colleagues from 
erstwhile HDFC Limited into the 
Bank’s fold. The amalgamation was 
a smooth one given that the culture 
and values of the organisations were 
aligned. We have always held that the 
talent, commitment and passion of our 
people is the bedrock of our success 
and investing in this talent pool can 
only add to a service first culture and 
good customer experience. 
Getting The Organisation 
Future Ready 
In 2021, the Bank announced Project 
Future Ready and we continue to 
make considerable progress in this. 
The following areas were identified as 
growth engines: Commercial (MSME) 
and Rural Banking, Government 
and Institutional Business, Wealth 
Management, Retail Assets, Corporate 
Banking, and Payments. These were 
to be driven by our delivery channels 
HDFC Bank Limited
2 4

of Branch Banking, TeleSales/Service/
Relationship and Digital Marketing 
backed by our technology and 
digital platforms.
The addition of home loans to 
the Bank’s portfolio adds a new 
dimension to the strategy especially 
the retail business.
To report on the past year, our Gross 
Advances (ex-merger) grew by 17.3 
per cent and Deposits (ex-merger) 
grew by 18.4 per cent.
An important word on Branch 
Banking. The Bank added over 900 
branches in the year under review 
and will continue to add more in the 
current financial year. More than half 
our branches are in the semi urban 
and rural areas where a physical 
presence is often a necessity although 
the majority of the transactions are 
digital in nature. These phygital 
branches are our investments. 
They will undoubtedly help garner 
deposits in the future, but it is the 
older branches that will act as current 
engines of deposit mobilisation. Our 
experience clearly reveals that there 
is an exponential growth in deposit 
base as the branches age. Our past 
experience indicates that deposit 
mobilisation has a strong correlation 
to the vintage of the branch. The 
investment in new branches is to 
ensure that we do not lose out on 
opportunities for the future while the 
existing branches continue to drive 
deposit growth.
Environmental, Social 
and Governance 
The significance of Environmental, 
Social and Governance (ESG) 
parameters can hardly be understated 
and we are fully conscious of the need 
for increased Board engagement 
on strategies that shape the Bank’s 
future pathways. Your Bank not only 
remains steadfast in its commitment 
to transparency in reporting on both, 
financial and non-financial parameters, 
but is now moving beyond this. 
While globally ESG frameworks are 
still evolving, our ESG disclosures 
are increasingly going through a 
similar rigour as financial parameters 
- especially with the mandating of 
assurance on certain ESG attributes.
The year under review marked the 
issuance of our first sustainable bond 
in the international markets which was 
well received. On the lending side, we 
continue to integrate environmental 
and social due diligence as an integral 
part of our overall credit assessments.
ESG considerations also have 
dependencies on the overall global 
macro and geopolitical environment, 
pace of policy and regulatory reforms 
and technology breakthroughs, 
especially pertaining to the transition 
to cleaner energy pathways. As the 
Bank navigates through the evidently 
growing climate-related financial 
risks and other unknown risks, we 
recognise the importance of a fortified 
and resilient balance sheet and the 
need to build buffers from a position 
of strength, so as to safeguard 
against future unforeseen shocks and 
stress scenarios.
Through our CSR initiatives under 
‘Parivartan’ we have impacted the 
lives of over 10 crore people. From 
upskilling farmers on scientific 
cropping patterns, providing 
placement linked training and 
mentoring of entrepreneurs, to 
supporting start-ups through 
incubators our consistent efforts have 
been to create an inclusive society. 
Providing livelihood opportunities 
remains at the core of all our initiatives.
In Financial Year 2023-24, the 
Bank has met its CSR obligations. 
Your Bank has executed its 
CSR commitments through 
210+ partnerships and over 260 
projects across 28 states and 8 
union territories.
Conclusion 
We began the second quarter of the 
last financial year with the merger. 
As we concluded the year, we saw 
merger synergies starting to play 
out. This fills us with optimism for the 
current financial year and beyond. 
Especially given the anticipated 
growth in the Indian economy. We will 
continue to pursue profitable growth 
without sacrificing asset quality.
Looking to the future, I’m confident 
that with the immensely talented and 
dedicated team at HDFC Bank, we will 
continue to innovate, drive sustainable 
growth, and make a positive impact 
on the communities we serve.
I would like to conclude with 
thanking my colleagues across the 
organisation, for their sterling support 
and commitment to the Bank’s valued 
customers. My thanks also to our 
Board and all stakeholders, who 
have continuously supported us over 
the years.

Delivering 
Consistent and 
Profitable Growth
The Financial Year 2023-24 was the year of the merger. The 
Balance Sheet size grew by 46.7 per cent in the fiscal, with 
a 26.4 per cent increase in Deposits and a 55.2 per cent 
growth in Advances. The Bank consolidated its position 
as the largest private sector bank by Balance Sheet size in 
India without compromising its asset quality.
This was achieved through the 
extensive reach across our 8,738 
branches as well as our strong digital 
footprint. Our Profit After Tax grew by 
37.9 per cent and GNPA stood at 
1.24 per cent.
The Cost to Income Ratio marginally 
decreased to 40.2 per cent in FY24 
from 40.4 per cent in FY23.
The Bank added over 900 branches 
in the Financial Year ended March 31, 
2024. The Core Net Interest Margin 
was at 3.53 per cent.
We remain well-capitalised which 
is reflected in our Capital Adequacy 
Ratio of 18.8 per cent. As a 
responsible bank, we have built 
a substantial cushion against any 
adverse impact with a Provision 
Coverage Ratio of 74.04 per cent. 
We continued to deliver value to 
shareholders, with an ROE of 
16.1 per cent. Our Earnings Per Share 
(EPS) increased by 8.2 per cent to 
H85.8, while dividend per share rose 
by 2.6 per cent to H19.5 in FY24.

Established in 2021, the Bank's Commercial and Rural 
Banking (CRB) Group caters to a diverse range of entities 
including Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), 
farmers (including the small and marginal ones), healthcare 
finance, equipment finance, commercial transport companies 
as well as joint liability and self-help groups. 
C O M M E R C I A L A N D R U R A L B A N K I N G
The diverse businesses are bound 
together by the common thread 
of having a significant presence in 
Semi Urban and Rural (SURU) India. 
More than half of our branches are 
located in SURU regions ensuring 
comprehensive coverage and 
accessibility to financial services 
where they are most needed. This 
strategic distribution facilitates 
easier access to banking facilities 
thus empowering individuals and 
businesses in these areas.
The CRB Group significantly 
contributes to the Bank's Priority 
Sector Lending (PSL) obligations 
which has assumed further 
significance post the merger. It also 
plays a pivotal role in advancing the 
financial inclusion agenda. Moreover, 
it is a profitable business, with a 
high Return on Assets (ROA) and 
effectively managed Non-Performing 
Assets (NPAs) due to adept 
sourcing channels and prudent risk 
management practices.

Propelled by the extensive geographical 
reach and profound understanding 
of local business dynamics, the CRB 
Business has displayed healthy growth 
since inception. HDFC Bank holds 
a leading position in MSME lending, 
leading in 14 states and securing a 
position among the top 3 in 21 states.
A dedicated relationship team 
ensures regular interactions with CRB 
customers, addressing their banking 
needs comprehensively and crossselling various products and services. 
There is a robust growth strategy in 
place for all major offerings. 
Agricultural financing is a key revenue 
stream and the group is geared to 
seize promising opportunities in Agriinfrastructure financing and diversifying 
into high-income agricultural products 
like dairy and horticulture. The Bank 
is present in 2.25 lakh villages to 
fund traditional agriculture and allied 
activities. Additionally, CRB is also 
dedicated to supporting Government 
schemes like the Agriculture 
Infrastructure Fund (AIF), Farmer 
Producer Organisations (FPOs), and 
Pradhan Mantri Formalisation of Micro 
Food Processing Enterprises (PMFME), 
while also lending to small and 
marginal farmers.
The Bank's strategic emphasis on 
expanding into new territories and 
strengthening the sales force has 
led it to capturing a market leading 
share in the commercial vehicle and 
equipment financing sector. It is also 
actively developing an ecosystem to 
extend reach within the Transportation 
Finance domain supported by a robust 
OEM relationship. 
Digital transformation is pivotal for 
growth across all segments. The Bank 
is digitising various aspects of the 
CRB Business, including customer 
touchpoints, document collection 
processes, sales, and service. 
The emphasis is on building digital 
underwriting capabilities through 
effective data management and 
API integration.
Overall, the CRB segment offers a 
vast market potential, and the Bank 
is poised to seize this opportunity 
through its expansive reach, innovative 
capabilities and digital prowess.

Aligning for 
Impact
HDFC Bank conducts a materiality assessment to discern 
and assess the issues that hold utmost importance for 
our business as well as both our internal and external 
stakeholders. In FY24, we reviewed our materiality assessment 
to comply with the latest GRI Universal Standards 2021 and 
integrate the concept of double materiality. 
M AT E R I A L I T Y
HDFC Bank Limited
3 8

This multi-faceted approach 
led to the final ranking of the 
14 sustainability issues into a 
materiality matrix.
The final analysis was presented 
to the Board of Directors.
We began by reviewing 
the 16 sustainability topics 
included in our FY23 materiality 
assessment, identified as a 
result of internal and external 
stakeholder engagements, data 
analysis, regulatory compliance 
and industry benchmarking.
In FY23, we prioritised our material topics by 
consolidating stakeholder survey responses. 
In the first stage, the responses within each 
group were consolidated to derive the 
priorities for the respective groups.
Next, the responses across different 
aspects were consolidated by assigning 
weights to each stakeholder group. The 
collective scores were then used to prioritise 
the topics as "Most important", "Important" 
and "Less important" (considering the reach 
of impacts within our value chain, magnitude 
of the impact, and likelihood of occurrence).
Drawing from the results of FY23, we further 
conducted a thorough analysis for assessing 
the economic, environmental and social impacts 
(positive and/or negative) associated with each 
topic. This was superimposed with the impact 
scores derived from the previous stakeholder 
consultations across two key dimensions 
reflecting impact of the material topics on the 
organisation (financial materiality) and society 
(impact materiality). After careful revaluation of 
16 material topics, few topics were merged to 
derive a list 14 topics relevant to the Bank.
As part of our risk assessment process, 
we have mapped the identified material 
topics against the risk categories which 
are a part of our risk management 
framework. Of the 14 material topics, 
9 have been identified as areas with 
opportunity and the remaining 5 
have the potential to pose risk to 
our business.

Management of Material Topic
At HDFC Bank, we recognise the significant influence we 
hold through our lending and financing activities. Engaging 
in sustainable and responsible financing practices allows 
us to invest in projects and industries that have positive 
environmental and social impacts. This not only aligns our 
values with the growing demand for ethical and sustainable 
investments but also enhances the Bank's reputation as 
a socially responsible institution. Furthermore, sustainable 
financing helps us improve our risk management practices 
by reducing exposure to environmentally and socially risky 
assets as well as foster long-term relationships with clients 
who prioritise sustainability.
We believe in Responsible Financing and, as a rule, do not 
fund projects that are part of our Prohibition List owing to 
the negative impact on the environment, health, and safety. 
Our goal is to make funding available for environmentally 
viable projects that help mitigate climate change. To reduce 
our carbon footprint, we continue to invest in renewable 
energy and energy efficiency projects and encourage our 
customers to make "green banking" decisions.
Description of Impact
(Opportunity, Positive, Actual, Within and 
Outside the Bank)
At HDFC Bank, we have adopted an enhanced and more 
comprehensive “ESG & Climate Change Assessment” 
framework, as part of our overall credit assessment for

Criteria” Framework (“the Framework”) to enhance our

Effective risk management safeguards our financial health 
by identifying, assessing, and mitigating potential losses 
from credit defaults, market fluctuations, liquidity issues, 
interest rate changes, and operational failures. Through the 
effective use of processes, information, and technology, 
we have developed a multi-layered risk management 
strategy that identifies, assesses, monitors, and manages 
risks (credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, interest rate 
risk, and operational risk). Our framework incorporates a 
Board-approved Stress Testing Policy & System, a vital 
component of our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment 
Process (ICAAP). Stress testing plays a vital role in this 
assessment by simulating a variety of stressful, yet realistic 
scenarios to assess our vulnerability to extreme conditions.
Description of Impact
(Risk: Reputational Risk
Impact: Negative, Potential, Within and 
Outside the Bank)
Effective risk management is crucial to safeguard our 
financial health and prevent systemic instability. As 
a result, our multi-layered risk management strategy 
actively identifies, assesses, and reports the risks 
inherent to our business operations to the appropriate 
levels of management so that risk mitigation actions can 
be implemented. 
Furthermore, we recognise the growing importance of 
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. Our 
ESG & Climate Change Assessment framework helps 
us identify and mitigate potential ESG risks and climate 
change threats associated with our borrowers and their 
business operations. 
Our independent risk management function ensures 
objectivity and oversight. A robust risk assessment helps 
us evaluate the likelihood and potential impact of each risk. 
We then implement a combination of mitigation techniques, 
such as setting credit limits, diversifying loan portfolios, 
managing interest rate exposure, and implementing robust 
internal controls, to proactively manage these risks.

Financial inclusion is a pressing issue, and the banking 
sector bears the responsibility of serving the underbanked 
people in rural, semi-urban, urban and metropolitan India. 
We see this as an opportunity to broaden our reach and 
make our services more accessible to the poorest people 
across the country.

Financial inclusion at HDFC Bank goes beyond traditional 
market expansion to offer opportunities to tap into 
untapped markets. This fosters financial stability and 
economic participation at the individual and community 
level. While we continue to focus on the Corporate Cluster 
and Government Business to increase penetration, our 
business segment of Commercial (MSME) and Rural 
Banking is well- positioned to capture the next wave 
of growth.

HDFC Bank implements a strategic approach to 
procurement, integrating environmentally and socially 
responsible considerations into our procurement 
practices. This approach yields operational efficiency, 
minimises waste generation, and reduces long-term 
operational expenditures for us.
Description of Impact
(Opportunity, Positive, Actual, Within and

As part of our ESG Policy Framework, we recognise the 
need to work closely with our suppliers to reduce waste, 
improve efficiency, reduce carbon footprint, and engage 
with them to understand their commitment towards 
human rights and labour practices. 
We will thus continue to work towards greater 
integration of environmental & social considerations in 
our procurement practices. The Bank will make efforts 
to procure products which are recycled, environmentfriendly, energy-efficient, and locally sourced.

HDFC Bank prioritises responsible asset management 
practices throughout the loan lifecycle, contributing to a 
sustainable financial system. Regularly monitoring and 
managing asset quality are essential for maintaining the 
Bank's financial stability and ensuring that we meet the 
obligations to depositors and other stakeholders.
Description of Impact
(Risk: Reputational Risk 
Impact: Risk, Negative, Potential, Within and 
Outside the Bank)
Asset quality is a fundamental risk for banks, directly 
impacting our financial stability. Our assets are 
essentially promises of future repayment. Weak asset 
quality can lead to financial losses and trigger a domino 
effect. This in turn can limit our ability to lend. In 
severe cases, very poor asset quality can even lead to 
disrupting the financial system and impacting depositors 
and the broader economy. Therefore, maintaining a 
high standard of asset quality is critical for us to ensure 
our own financial well-being and contribute to a healthy 
financial system. As part of our Environmental, Social, 
and Governance (ESG) Risk Management Policy 
Framework, we evaluate the environmental and social 
risks and opportunities associated with our lending 
activities. This analysis guides our lending decisions 
and fosters client relationships that promote sustainable 
business practices.

These factors collectively fuel growth 
in GDP and per capita income, 
consequently increasing the demand 
for financial products and services. 
At the Bank, we are well poised to 
capitalise on this opportunity through 
consistent innovation in our offerings 
and technological capabilities. The 
merger of erstwhile HDFC Limited 
with the Bank has further enriched 
our product suite with mortgage and 
realty finance business. Our focus is 
on risk adjusted consistent, profitable 
growth and this drives our strategy 
across all businesses. While pursuing 
this growth trajectory, we remain 
committed to robust governance 
and risk management practices, 
ensuring a harmonious balance 
between expansion and maintaining a 
portfolio quality.
Execution is our strength, as 
evidenced by the seamless integration 
of two financial powerhouses’ postmerger. This facilitates a deeper 
customer engagement, establishes 
an extensive distribution network and 
fosters growth across all segments.

Re-Imagining the 
Branch Channel
As we recognise the increasing shift 
towards digital transactions, we 
envision the transformation of retail 
branches into engagement centres. 
Rather than being solely transactional, 
branches will serve as platforms 
for meaningful conversations with 
customers. We aim to provide holistic, 
need-based financial solutions by 
leveraging our diverse range of 
products and services. To achieve 
this, we have identified the following

Micro-market Focused Multi 
Format Distribution
We are transforming branch banking 
into a multi-format model based on a 
granular micro market approach. This 
involves using a multi-variate model 
to identify high potential markets, 
considering factors such as population 
demographics, deposits and 
advances data, delinquency insights, 
climate risk assessments and future 
trends. Branch formats may vary from 
full service physical branches to smart 
banking lobbies or digital banking 
units with self-service kiosks as well 
as business correspondent-based 
models. We closely track profitability 
and break-even for each format to 
ensure targeted investments and 
cost-effectiveness. By expanding 
our presence in identified locations 
through multiple formats, we not only 
increase our catchment area but 
also benefit from network effects. 
Therefore, we continue to invest in 
expanding our presence in identified 
locations through multiple formats.

Our relationship management 
architecture ensures continuous 
nurturing and implementation of 
next best actions aimed at fulfilling 
customer needs. With a 'service first 
culture', we leverage robust analytics 
and AI to suggest personalised 
recommendations based on customer 
transactions and digital behaviour 
for services and products. This 
also allows for validation from the 
Relationship Manager which then 
results in recommendations for the 
next best action for each customer. 
Relationship Managers are also 
equipped with real-time data for 
immediate next best actions based 
on customer interactions. We are now 
looking to enter the next leg of this 
journey by leveraging the account 
aggregator model and Generative AI 
capabilities to ensure that we have the 
right proposition for the right customer

Our payment products are key to

growth journey.
Our credit card business continues 
to be a leader on many fronts. 
Having built best in class products 
and platforms over the last two 
decades we continue to maintain our 
dominance with more than 2 crore 
satisfied customers. A wide range of 
card products backed with superior 
customer service experience across 
the physical and digital mediums, have 
ensured that we continue to build 
momentum by issuing more than 5 
lakh cards every month.
Commercial cards which are used 
by various business entities to cater 
to multiple expenses around travel, 
entertainment, procurement and 
statutory payments have also been 
a key area of focus for the HDFC 
Bank payments business. With an 
experience of more than two decades 
of serving SMEs and large corporates, 
our payments business offers 
unique payment solutions for various 
industries like Aviation, Travel and 
Insurance. By leveraging advanced 
data analytics, we identify traditional 
payment flows and migrate them to 
a convenient and seamless digital 
payment flow thereby helping our 
customers manage their payments in 
a more efficient manner.
Our commercial payment solutions 
have found wide acceptance across 
the industry ensuring that we are the 
market leaders not only on an overall 
basis but also on an individual basis 
across multiple segments.
The Bank is a leading issuer of debit 
cards with more than 5 crore debit 
cards in force. The spend per card 
is 3x of the industry average thereby 
reflecting a healthy profile of the 
Bank’s customers.
In addition to credit and debit cards 
the Bank also offers a wide range of 
prepaid cards for use by individuals 
and corporates. These cards can 
be used across multiple merchant 
categories in India as well as overseas.
Our Acceptance Business which is 
spread across the length and the 
breadth of the country has been a 
significant contributor to the digital 
payments growth in the country. 
Over the last few decades, we have 
continued to invest and grow this 
business by ensuring that we onboard 
small, medium & large businesses to 
accept multiple payment form factors 
which includes Cards, UPI, Central 
Bank Digital Currency and Wallets.
Equipped with “Vyapar” our digital 
acceptance platform, we continue to 
maintain our leadership position in the 
acceptance business serving more 
than 30 lakh merchant establishments.

designed and not only suited to meet 
the needs of Start-Ups as well as 
large businesses but also cater to 
HDFC Bank Limited

the growing requirements of various 
associations, trusts, religious and 
Government institutions.
We also have the full array of products 
catering to our merchants partners 
enabling them to seamlessly collect 
payments in the offline world. We 
support collection of payments 
through the ubiquitous PoS terminals 
and are also a leading player in 
the UPI dominated QR payments. 
Our product range is flexible and 
complemented by latest technology to 
accommodate customisations.
Innovation has been a constant theme 
across the Payments Business. The 
Financial Year 2023-24 saw the Bank 
introducing several new products and 
payment platforms.
The Bank’s MyCards platform which 
is a one stop platform to manage 
HDFC Bank Credit and Debit Cards, 
FASTag and Consumer Durable loans 
continued to grow at a rapid pace, 
with more than 1.3 crore card users 
being added only in the last year. The 
platform continues to be enriched 
through addition of new features at 
regular intervals.
SmartHub Vyapar, an integrated 
payment, banking and business 
solution that caters to the daily needs 
of merchants and helps them drive 
business growth also continued 
to witness widespread adoption 
with more than 16 lakh merchants 
onboarded across the country. It 
handled over 45 lakh transactions 
daily in March 2024.
The newly launched PayZapp has 
seen a strong growth with 75 lakh 
customers onboarded as on March 
31, 2024. PayZapp provides a unified 
experience across contactless, QR 
and UPI payments. It is currently 
among the top-rated payments 
application in the country.
Given HDFC Bank's strong franchise 
on the issuance as well as the 
acceptance side, the Bank also 
leverages its network of consumers 
and merchants to enable affordability 
solutions. It has a very strong 
consumer finance programme helping 
consumers to purchase goods and 
services complimenting their lifestyle.
The Bank's future strategy revolves 
around the opportunities in the 
payment’s ecosystem and the vibrant 
Indian economy. It continues to focus 
on sustainable growth strategies, 
emphasising on resilience and holistic 
impacts. The digital strategy is aligned 
to enhance customer engagement 
across all touchpoints of the Bank.
As an extension of the digital strategy, 
the Bank is poised to launch a 
completely new and refreshed Mobile 
and NetBanking platform which is user 
friendly and offers a very high level 
of security.
Tech and Digital: A 
Customer Centric 
Evolution
The digital transformation witnessed 
in the financial landscape has 
brought institutions closer to their 
customers than ever before. From 
instant microfinance to the largest 
corporates and from the urban youth 
to agri and dairy farmers - our Bank is 
proud to offer best-in-class products 
and services to customers across 
the spectrum.
To further harness next-gen 
technologies and innovations for 
serving our customers better, we are 
pivoting our strategic direction with 
“Shift Right”: shifting from a productcentric approach to a customercentric focus.
Our product-centric approach ensured 
that our core banking infrastructure 
was the heart of our operations, 
supported by layers of data, 
integrations and diverse channels and 
partnerships for customer interaction.
Now, as we embrace a customercentric model, we understand that 
Data enhanced with Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) and Machine 
Learning (ML) at the core of our 
operations will enable deeper insights 
into our customers’ behaviour, 
preferences, and needs, further 
allowing customer personalisations 
and customisations while protecting 
their privacy and security.
The data would be powered by 
modernised, decoupled core 
systems built for scalability and 
demand with higher availabilities. The 
‘lightened core’ would leverage cloudnative architectures delivering greater 
performance and secure access.
Next, an API orchestration layer 
will facilitate seamless integration 
and communication across services 
and platforms. This will ensure that 
our systems and services are always

segment, our aim is to support the 
growth and success of MSMEs by 
providing access to credit and other 
financial solutions and services. We 
cater to MSMEs in manufacturing, 
exports, retail and wholesale 
trade, supply chain network, 
infrastructure companies, farmer 
finance, commercial agriculture, joint 
liability and self-help groups under 
microfinance, commercial equipment 
and transport and healthcare 
ready with plug-&-play connectivity 
providing enriched, streamlined 
experiences for our customers.
Further, by supporting a variety of 
channels for customer engagement 
such as mobile apps, online banking, 
chatbots and in-person services, we 
can meet customers where they are 
and provide consistent, high-quality 
engagement across touchpoints. This 
multi-channel approach ensures that 
customers can access our services in 
the way that is most convenient and 
comfortable to them.
As organisations are increasingly 
taking their experiences directly to 
customers rather than expecting 
customers to come to them, 
Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) has 
begun assuming relevance. We see 
this as an opportunity to embed our 
digital offerings into the channels that 
customers prefer to use.
“Shift Right” will not only expand our 
reach and market presence but also 
foster innovation and collaboration 
within the financial ecosystem, 
ultimately benefiting our customers 
through a broader range of innovative 
solutions. By adopting a customercentric approach, we will ensure that 
our services are more responsive 
and personalised while accelerating 
scalability, flexibility and innovation 
thus driving long-term customer 
satisfaction and loyalty.
Our dedication to delivering 
personalised digital banking solutions 
and ensuring inclusive access to 
banking services underscores our 
mission to be a trusted partner for 
all our customers. As we continue to 
innovate and adapt, our Shift Right 
approach will guide us in building a 
resilient, forward-looking Bank that 
remains steadfast in its commitment to 
excellence and customer satisfaction.

businesses. We are committed to 
resolving challenges such as limited 
credit access, high borrowing costs 
and collateral constraints that are 
faced by this sector. Our lending 
activities under this segment play a 
significant role in meeting our Priority 
Sector Lending (PSL) obligations. 
The goals in CRB are three-fold: to 
increase PSL lending, to grow the 
book and to generate income while 
maintaining portfolio quality. Our 
Bank’s PSL lending comprises 53 
per cent of our total book of which 
46 per cent is organic. CRB Group 
has been clocking a y-o-y growth in 
the range of 25-30 per cent for the 
past ten quarters with a GNPA of 1.65 
per cent which is one of the lowest in 
the industry.
We have in place a robust growth 
strategy for all our major offerings. In 
MSME segment, we already have a 
strong presence across all states with 
a leading market share in 14 of them 
and securing a position among the top 
3 in 21 states. We are now building 
in granularity by targeting districtlevel leadership.
We continue to pursue agricultural 
financing and consider the portfolio 
an important wallet generator for 
the Bank in the future. We see this 
potential, as trends shift from precrop working capital financing to agri 
infrastructure financing. Further as 
envisioned, we have built a strong 
portfolio of diverse offerings across 
high income agri products such 
as dairy and horticulture. Under 
agriculture finance, we currently 
have a presence in 2.25 lakh villages 
and we aim to penetrate more in 
these villages to build further on the 
portfolio. We are currently the no.1 in 
the transportation finance business. 
While we continue to innovate and 
enhance our digital offerings, we 
have ensured robust analytics and 
risk management capabilities to back 
these offerings. Risk Management is 
at the core of our product offerings. 
Also, there are offerings in new and 
under-penetrated equipment category 
as well as non-equipment financing. 
We will do this by leveraging our 
strong OEM relationships, common 
distribution channels, geographies 
and customer base across our 
existing portfolio and presence. Digital 
journeys and digitalisation is a key 
enabler for growth in this segment. We 
continue to digitalise a major part of 
CRB business.
We are digitalising customer 
touchpoints, document collection 
processes, sales service and others. 
We have enabled self-service digital 
capabilities across all our branches. 
Going forward, we aim to build 
capabilities for digital underwriting 
through data management and 
APIfication. The segment that the 
CRB Group serves has tremendous 
market potential and the Bank is in a 
strong position to capitalise on this 
opportunity through our extensive 
reach, innovative capabilities and 
digital prowess.

Retail Assets Strategy
The Bank has been the market leader 
in all the asset categories relating to 
personal finance and continues to 
maintain its lead position. It has been 
a combination of both secured and 
unsecured business. Our strategy 
involves a comprehensive approach 
to ensure sustainable growth and 
maintain impeccable asset quality. Our 
strength has been to continually look 
out for new opportunities and build up 
business propositions to cater to every 
segment of the industry. We have an 
array of products for both personal 
and business needs.
Our strategy is to continually enhance 
digital offerings across all our retail 
assets, do this at prices attuned to 
our risk appetite and consistently 
maintain our portfolio quality. 
We would continue our focus on 
digital distribution and increase the 
unassisted sourcing through Xpress 
Personal Loan, Xpress Business 
Loan, Xpress Auto Loan, Loan Against 
Shares / Mutual Funds. Introduction 
of new workflow system for Gold 
Loan, will bring in enhanced customer 
experience. We continuously strive to 
acquire New to Bank customers with 
our best-in-class asset offerings. Our 
indigenous digital journey not only 
enables our existing customers but 
also seamlessly propels business from 
New to Bank customers.
The large, existing customer base of 
over 9 crore provides a fertile ground 
for future growth. We would continue 
to provide products and offer solutions 
for customers’ needs based on our 
rich understanding of their profile. This 
would bring in higher engagement 
through our internal channels viz., 
branch network and virtual team to 
step up the business growth. Both the 
channels put together would reduce 
the overall cost of sourcing and 
improve our Cost to Income Ratio.
While we continue to innovate and 
enhance our digital offerings, we 
have ensured robust analytics and 
risk management capabilities to back 
these offerings. Risk Management is 
at the core of our product offerings 
with robust underwriting mechanisms 
in place to support our lending 
decisions. We ensure prudent pricing 
across all products factoring in 
the risk.
The Bank has expanded its branch 
network and we would capitalise on 
the same by increasing our offering 
and reaching emerging geographies. 
Our delinquency levels have been 
one of the lowest, with a large portion 
of the customers have better credit 
scores. Our robust processes and 
controls have managed the risk 
associated with varied asset lending. 
Our Gold Loan presence has also 
increased by 5X in the last 2 years.
As we move forward, all retail asset 
products would be made available 
to the erstwhile HDFC Limited’s 
customers thus enhancing our 
customer base. The way forward 
for us is to continue to offer loans 
seamlessly across geographies, 
expanding our reach in Semi-Urban 
and Rural markets for deeper 
penetration and maintain our 
leadership in urban areas and cities.
Home Loans
The merger of the erstwhile HDFC 
Limited with HDFC Bank has been 
transformational for the Bank. It has 
now emerged as a Bank with one of 
the largest home loan portfolios in 
the country.
A trusted home loan product is now 
riding on HDFC Bank’s network 
of over 8,700 branches, digital 
touchpoints, complete product range 
and superior technology. 
This synergy has enabled us to offer 
best-in-class home loan offerings to 
existing and new customers. Postmerger turnaround time has improved 
significantly. This coupled with the 
erstwhile HDFC Limited’s strength of 
connecting with customers in person 
is a potential game changer in terms of 
both sales’ turnover and cross- sell.
The Bank is in the process of 
converting erstwhile HDFC Limited’s 
service centres to branches in 
a phased manner. As a part of 
enhancing the cross-sell strategy, 
home loan customers are now able 
to avail of a wide range of products/
services like Deposits, Consumer 
Durable Loans, Credit Cards, Wealth 
Advisory Products, Unsecured Loans 
and other retail loans.
Savings Accounts for New to Bank 
customers has moved to about 85 per 
cent from 35 per cent. This sets the 
foundation for a stronger connect with 
incremental customers.
In addition to this, our strategy is 
to improve the focus on the selfemployed category which will 
further increase opportunity in this 
segment. Post-merger, the Bank has 
launched and expanded its product 
basket through banking surrogate 
programmes as well as leveraging its 
knowledge for better assessment of 
such profiles for home loans.
With differentiated strengths and 
despite having a larger book 
than peers, the Bank’s model is 
generating huge benefits on a monthly 
basis without compromising on 
its underwriting standards and is 
expected to generate substantial value 
for both customers and the Bank in 
the future.
The gross retail mortgages stood 
at H7,72,786 crore, compared to the 
previous year's H1,78,840 crore. The 
figures for the period ended March 
31, 2024 include the operations 
of erstwhile HDFC Limited which 
HDFC Bank Limited
6 2

amalgamated with and into HDFC 
Bank on July 01, 2023 and hence 
comparisons with the previous 
periods have to be looked at in light of 
the same.
The Bank believes that the 
fundamental demand for housing 
will continue to be strong in the 
long run in India due to a favourable 
environment. India is expected to 
have the largest working population 
by 2050, which is likely to give a 
major fillip to urbanisation in the 
country. Eight crore families are 
likely to move from rural areas to 
cities in the country, increasing the 
need for housing. This is clearly an 
opportunity for the industry and 
HDFC Bank is well positioned to help 
fulfill the housing dreams of millions. 
The Bank is committed to offering 
home loan solutions to diverse 
income categories.
Going forward, our aim is to retain 
and built on our strengths to offer a 
best-in-class service and capitalise 
on the immense opportunities that are 
available in the country.
HDFC Bank Edge for 
Corporate Cluster
Corporate Banking remains a 
steady contributor to our growth 
and profitability. Our customer base 
spans from prominent large business 
houses, multinational corporations, 
manufacturing and service sector 
companies to public sector 
enterprises and financial institutions, 
amongst others. Our focus is on 
holistic corporate engagement. We 
serve them by extending credit as well 
as by offering banking products and 
solutions that assist in managing their 
entire financial business cycle. Our 
corporate solutions include working 
capital and term loans at the inception 
of a project, operational solutions 
such as cash management, supplychain integration, international trade 
financing and payment solutions 
such as tax management as well as 
payroll management.
Our comprehensive range of 
products and services along with our 
relationship approach provides us 
with competitive advantage. While we 
focus on growth, we ensure pricing 
discipline and are selective in the 
exposures we undertake. We have a 
well-diversified book across multiple 
industries. The average rating of the 
book is between AA to AA+.
We endeavour to leverage our 
strong relationships with existing 
customers to increase our wallet 
share. This entails deepening share 
within existing products as well as 
designing effective solutions across 
their needs to increase their product 
holding. In addition, we are also 
focusing on New to Bank acquisitions 
through engagement with large 
corporates, targeting Government 
undertakings and multinational 
corporations to expand our reach. We 
aim to capitalise on the Government 
infrastructure push and Production 
Linked Incentive scheme (PLI) which 
will open up incremental opportunity 
for the banking sector. We have 
also put in place a liability strategy 
to improve wallet share through 
our transaction banking, viz, cash 
management, payments and trade 
solutions. Supply chain financing is 
also a key growth driver for the Bank. 
We are bolstering this through the 
use of technology such as our supply 
chain platform that acts as a onestop shop for transaction needs, as 
well as the development of needbased offerings.

K E Y G R O W T H D R I V E R S
We are continuing on a path of 
strategic digital transformation to 
further widen and deepen wallet 
share from corporates by enhancing 
Employee Experience (EX), Customer 
Engagement (CE) and creating an 
ecosystem for seamless banking. We 
are enhancing Employee Experience 
through the launch of platforms 
enabling an end-to-end journey for 
the Relationship Managers, actionable 
analytics, pricing intelligence and 
dashboard automation. On the 
customer front, we are progressing 
on the path of shifting from a product 
focus to an ecosystem approach and 
investing in enabling ERP integration 
across functions.
In addition to pure construction 
finance facility, we are also financing 
Greenfield under-construction 
commercial office space with 
developers having a proven track 
record. The construction finance 
facilities will get converted into lowrisk Lease Rental Discounting (LRD) 
facilities resulting in a healthy pipeline 
of LRD book for the Bank.
Through these initiatives, we are 
re-imagining the corporate cluster to 
function as a digital corporate bank. 
We believe the runway is long and 
our aim is to serve corporates with 
the entire gamut of products and 
services and capitalise on the benefit 
of synergies across our Bank.
HDFC Bank offers comprehensive 
structured solutions to help corporates 
make their supply chain more 
robust. These programmes cater 
to the working capital requirements 
by easing liquidity and removing 
the underlying trade risk of 
the transaction.
Supply Chain Finance (SCF)
As part of our digital transformation 
strategy, we have launched the 
SCF Underwriting & Onboarding 
platform to ease the anchor client’s 
counterparty onboarding process 
and provide instantaneous credit 
decisioning in less than 30 minutes of 
application submission. In addition to 
the enhanced Customer Experience, 
the platform also enhances the 
productivity of the Bank’s internal 
stakeholders. It enables HDFC Bank 
to build a granular SCF book and 
given the automation of the origination 
and underwriting legs, the platform 
is also expected to give an impetus 
to higher deal velocity on the existing 
SCF Transaction Platform.
Realty Business Finance 
Post-merger, the Bank inherited 
the realty business finance. It has 
commenced offering Construction 
Finance facilities mainly to well 
established borrowers with a strong 
track record. This business largely 
covers the rental discounting business 
as well as construction finance. There 
was a significant shift in regulation and 
processes. The Bank has successfully 
managed to ensure that the transition 
was smooth and seamless. There 
is a continuous endeavour to make 
borrower’s journey from application 
to disbursement smooth and fast. 
With continuous automation and 
digitalisation of various processes, 
we have been successful in reducing 
our overall TAT resulting in customer 
satisfaction and better service.
We offer funding for ready / under 
construction residential / commercial 
properties, Hotels, clubs, schools, 
hospitals among others. Lease Rental 
Discounting is another key product 
offered by Realty Business Finance.
HDFC Bank is the largest player 
in Real Estate finance with market 
share of close to 20 per cent. We are 
geographically spread across 15 cities 
across India and are present in both 
HDFC Bank Limited

experts across various aspects of Real 
Estate and related products.
There is an immense scope of 
providing other banking services to 
our customers. We aim to be a one 
stop shop for these customers and 
provide them with services like CMS, 
liability products like Term Deposits 
and others.
Technological advancements and 
seamless end to end customer 
journeys are our key focus. Realty 
Business Finance strives hard to 
achieve this objective and play a 
pivotal role in Bank’s growth story 
and adhering to the mantra of 
‘Customer First’.

Wealth Business achieved significant 
growth with a 35 per cent increase 
in client base and now serves over 
84,000 households. The team has

a hub-and-spoke model. Our Assets

comprehensive one-stop solution for 
Investment Banking, Lending, and

through 160+ client events in FY24.
Our "Service First" culture ensured

growth by offering superior product 
selection and an enhanced service 
experience facilitated by engaged 
and trusted Wealth Bankers. With a 
strong brand presence and over two

through robust processes, diligent 
research methodology and bespoke 
recommendation model for Portfolio 
Management Services (PMS) and 
Alternate Investment Funds (AIF) 
product selection in addition to 
the FAMA model for selection of 
mutual funds.
HDFC Bank is committed to 
continuously investing in our talent, 
providing top-tier training programmes

Digital is a platform where increasing 
number of our customers spend their 
time and hence, it is crucial to be 
present in this medium to engage and 
build our brand with our key target 
audience. We have built a strong 
brand IP through Vigil Aunty – our own 
social media influencer, who creates 
awareness amongst customers about 
frauds and helps them to be aware 
of how to avoid them. She has 21+ 
lakh followers in social media and 
about 8 lakh on WhatsApp. This 
IP has helped us to strengthen our 
leadership position by taking the lead 
on an issue which plagues the entire 
industry. We also leverage social 
media platforms to drive moment 
marketing by celebrating key Indian 
stories, responding to trending 
themes and being present topically 
to establish brand associations of 
modern, dynamic, and progressive.

IMPACT OF DIGITAL MARKETING
helped create brand love amongst 
the new and digitally savvy set of 
customers leading to increased brand 
awareness and brand loyalty for our 
financial solutions and services.
The second key aspect which digital 
marketing delivers on is to create a 
strong digital first culture amongst 
both the employees of the Bank as 
well as its customers. This primarily 
aims at creating frictionless customer 
experiences for availing our products, 
for taking care of their servicing needs 
as well as providing app platforms 
to manage their day-to-day money 
and payments needs. And then 
leveraging these digital journeys to 
shift the purchase behaviour of our 
customers to adopt unassisted digital 
journeys and save costs for the Bank. 
By executing this strategy, we aim 
to improve our direct contribution 
through digital to business generation.
We invest in advanced analytics and 
data science using cloud-based 
tools and advanced AI / ML models 
to gain a deep understanding of 
customer behaviour and preferences, 
curate personalised interventions and 
execute digital marketing plans at 
scale. We have revamped our digital 
journeys for loans, deposits and 
payment solutions enabling customers 
to purchase products in a frictionless 
manner. Our advanced analytics 
engine allows us to test hypotheses, 
build models and understand 
customer needs for meaningful 
interactions and relationship building. 
Our goal is to address relevant 
customer needs with the right product, 
at the right time and through their 
preferred communication channel.
To drive end-to-end outcome of 
unassisted business generation, we 
work in cross-functional teams called 
PODs. These PODs comprising the 
marketing, business and product 
teams are responsible for leveraging 
data-backed analyses to solve 
business problems. To implement

Nevertheless, the global landscape 
remains dynamic with major Central 
Banks closely monitoring inflation 
and economic indicators. Qualitative 
factors such as enhanced disclosures, 
robust codes of conduct and 
transparent governance structures 
remain pivotal for ensuring stability 
and trust in the financial sector. 
Additionally, the Reserve Bank of India 
(RBI) has prioritised initiatives to foster 
inclusion and innovation within the 
sector in recent years. From bolstering 
digital infrastructure to safeguarding 
customer protection, RBI's 
interventions aim to enhance the ease

Growth Landscape 
The outlook for the Indian banking sector in FY24 
appears optimistic. Both the banking system and 
Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) exhibit stability. 
Buoyed by healthy capital ratios, improved asset quality 
and consistent earnings growth, the sector is positioned

India Holds Steady Amidst 
Global Volatility 
The global economy is expected 
to maintain its resilience despite a 
tight monetary policy in 2024. The 
International Monetary Fund raised 
its global growth forecast by 10 
basis points to 3.2 per cent for 2024. 
It is expected that emerging and 
developing economies will experience 
a growth rate of 4.2 per cent in 2024, 
which is largely consistent with the 
4.3 per cent growth recorded in 2023. 
Conversely, advanced economies are 
projected to witness a slight uptick 
in growth estimated at 1.7 per cent 
in 2024 compared to 1.6 per cent 
in 2023. Certain Central Banks in 
advanced economies are expected 
to maintain higher policy rates for 
an extended period due to elevated 
inflation readings. Additionally, a surge 
in commodity prices including crude 
oil and disruptions in the supply chain 
amidst escalating tensions in the 
Middle East may impede progress in 
disinflation and present challenges for 
Central Banks.
India is poised to maintain its position 
as one of the fastest-growing 
economies globally in the Financial 
Year 2024-25. The Reserve Bank of 
India (RBI) anticipates GDP to grow 
by 7.2 per cent in FY25, compared 
to 8.2 per cent in FY24. Economic 
momentum is expected to receive 
a boost from a further uptick in 
private capital expenditure and 
ongoing Government capital outlays. 
Additionally, the stronger-thananticipated global growth outlook 
augurs well for India's economic 
growth. Moreover, domestic 
consumer spending is expected to 
rebound especially in rural areas 
supported by a normal monsoon, 
stable inflation, and a reduction in 
interest rates. Domestic inflation is 
projected to average 4.6 per cent in 
FY25, assuming a normal monsoon, 
compared to 5.4 per cent in FY24. A 
favourable base effect and subdued 
core inflation (excluding food and fuel) 
are anticipated to lend support.
HDFC Bank has a robust risk 
management framework that helps 
maintain stability and resilience in 
its operations. It regularly conducts 
topical stress tests to assess the 
potential impact of geopolitical, 
macroeconomic and sectoral trends. 
The Bank continuously adapts its 
strategies and actions to enhance 
its ability to withstand potential 
challenges. Furthermore, HDFC Bank 
is dedicated to fostering inclusive 
growth by innovating and developing 
tailored offerings for the Semi-Urban 
and Rural market. The merger has 
further strengthened the Bank’s 
capacity to serve its customers 
and has opened up opportunities 
for cross-selling. Through these 
initiatives, HDFC Bank continues to 
contribute to India's economic growth 
while upholding high standards of 
financial integrity.

Focus on Data Privacy and 
Cyber Security
In recent years, the banking sector has 
undergone a profound transformation 
with the extensive integration of 
digitalisation and cutting-edge 
technologies. This transformation 
has brought forth not only numerous 
opportunities but also formidable 
challenges particularly in the realms 
of cybersecurity and data privacy. 
The landscape of cyber threats 
has undergone rapid and complex 
changes fuelled by targeted attacks, 
the proliferation of Ransomware-as-aService (RaaS) incidents, the utilisation 
of AI/ML to orchestrate sophisticated 
attacks as well as the prevalence of 
DDoS attacks and coordinated group 
cyber assaults. The repercussions of 
cyberattacks are profound, impacting 
not only financial institutions' bottom 
lines but also their brand reputation 
and customer trust. 
Moreover, these incidents often result 
in attrition and significant financial 
losses. As the banking sector 
increasingly adopts cloud-enabled 
services as part of IT modernisation 
initiatives and digital-first business 
At HDFC Bank, we are committed 
to robust cyber security and data 
privacy as part of our technology 
transformation journey. Key initiatives 
include the establishment of a nextgeneration Cyber Security Operations 
Center, Advanced Security Incident 
and Event Management solutions 
augmented by AI and ML capabilities, 
24/7 defacement monitoring and a 
zero-trust architecture approach. 
In addition, we also have a data 
privacy program which is led by the 
Data Privacy Officer and overseen 
by the Board and Chief Data Officer 
ensuring stringent compliance with 
relevant regulations.

strategies, concerns regarding 
related threats have intensified. 
Recognising securing the cloud entails 
a shared responsibility, organisations 
are actively implementing robust 
measures to safeguard their 
cloud infrastructure. 
Regulators in India are also actively 
taking measures to ensure data 
privacy. This is evident through the 
Digital Personal Data Protection 
Act 2023, emphasising the nation's 
commitment to safeguarding data 
privacy rights.

Growing Emphasis on 
Sustainable Financing and 
Climate Risk Management
The escalating impact of climaterelated events has prompted a 
heightened emphasis on resilience 
across sectors with the financial 
sector playing a pivotal role in 
mobilising resources for green 
activities. Climate change and 
transition finance have become central 
to global discourse. 
In addition, integrating climate and 
ESG related risks in underwriting 
policies and risk management 
framework is becoming increasingly 
important for financial services 
companies. The increasing threat 
of climate change and its physical 
damage are significant concerns that 
may impact portfolio performance. 
Shifting market perceptions and 
increasing demand for environmentally 
friendly products and services also 
have an impact on the cashflows of 
portfolio companies as the world 
transitions to a low-carbon economy. 
Effective risk management is essential 
to manage and mitigate these impacts. 
Moreover, inadequate information 
about climate-related financial risks 
can lead to mispricing of assets and 
misallocation of capital emphasising 
the need for a better, more consistent 
and comparable disclosures. 
Globally, the publication of IFRS 
Sustainability Standards in June 2023 
is a step in this direction. Aligned 
with global trends, SEBI introduced 
mandatory reporting of the Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability 
Report (BRSR) for top 1,000 listed 
entities in India in May 2021. SEBI 
also mandated assurance on select 
metrics in the BRSR to further 
enhance the quality and comparability 
of ESG Disclosures. Additionally, 
RBI's draft disclosure framework on 
Climate-related Financial Risks in 
February 2024 focuses specifically 
on disclosures related to governance 
systems, risk management policies, 
and the strategies and targets 
developed by financial services entities 
to manage climate-related risks.
The Bank has conducted internal 
exercises to evaluate physical and 
transition risks arising from climate 
change. The Bank has developed 
initiatives to manage climate-related 
risks at the project, portfolio, and 
organisational levels. Further details 
on these initiatives can be found in the 
'climate related disclosures' section of 
the report.
Additionally, we actively monitor 
and externally verify the carbon 
emissions resulting from the Bank’s 
operations to manage and reduce our 
environmental impact. We also comply 
with all relevant regulations including 
those related to the BRSR, mandated 
by SEBI.

Regulatory Changes and 
Government Initiatives
The Government of India has made 
significant strides in promoting 
financial inclusion through the Pradhan 
Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY). 
Leveraging the PMJDY accounts, 
the Government has effectively 
facilitated Direct Benefit Transfers 
(DBTs), streamlining the distribution 
of subsidies and welfare benefits. 
In FY24, transactions totalling 
H6.36 lakh crore were executed 
through DBT. Additionally, there is 
a continued focus on affordable 
housing with the extension of 
the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana 
(Gramin) in the Interim Union Budget 
for FY25, sanctioning additional two 
crore houses over the next five years. 
Concurrently, RBI also continued its 
commitment to promoting financial 
inclusion through the expansion of 
digital payment infrastructure and the 
introduction of innovative banking 
services. Further in FY24, RBI also 
implemented stringent licensing 
requirements and heightened 
scrutiny aimed at ensuring the 
sector's financial stability and 
responsible operations.
As a responsible Bank, we are 
committed to taking banking solutions 
to the remote areas of the country 
and enabling underbanked sections 
of the population to access formal 
financial channels.
With over 50 per cent of our branches 
located in semi-urban and rural 
(SURU) areas we ensure banking 
solutions reach the remote areas 
of the country and provide formal 
banking channels to the under-banked 
population. We are committed to 
the Government’s flagship initiative, 
Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana 
(PMJDY), along with other initiatives 
such as Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti 
Bima Yojana (PMJJBY), Pradhan 
Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana 
(PMSBY), Atal Pension Yojana (APY), 
PM SVANidhi and Pradhan Mantri 
Mudra Yojana (PMMY). One of our 
CSR pillars - Skill Development And 
Livelihood Enhancement Initiative 
aligns with the RBI’s National Strategy 
for Financial Inclusion (NSFI). Through 
our Financial Literacy Programme, 
we focus on financially excluded 
individuals and those at the bottom 
of the pyramid. We conduct financial 
literacy camps through rural branches 
and designated Financial Literacy 
Centres. Additionally, we actively 
participate in the Pradhan Mantri 
Awas Yojana. We provide last-mile 
access through mobile applications 
such as UPI, Aadhaar and RuPayenabled Micro-ATMs.

Advancements in 
Tech-based Banking 
Technological advancements 
have revolutionised banking and 
finance sectors, driving innovation 
and efficiency. The rise of Artificial 
Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning 
(ML) and Generative AI has 
transformed industry operations from 
asset management to fraud detection. 
Aligning with the Payments Vision 
2025, the Government of India is 
actively shaping payment systems, 
exploring alternate authentication 
methods and facilitating IoT-based 
payments. The introduction of UPI 
Lite X and conversational instructions 
enhances accessibility to digital 
payments and ease of use. UPI 
Lite X utilises NFC technology, 
facilitating seamless retail digital 
payments in areas with limited internet 
connectivity, reducing transaction 
declines and promoting financial 
inclusion. Additionally, conversational 
instructions powered by AI offer an 
intuitive and secure method for users 
to initiate and complete transactions 
through engaging conversations on 
smartphones and feature phones. 
Drawing insights gleaned from Kisan 
Credit Card (KCC) and dairy pilots, RBI 
alongside the Reserve Bank Innovation 
Hub (RBIH), launched the Public Tech 
Platform in August 2023. This platform 
leverages open APIs and standards to 
integrate services like Aadhaar e-KYC, 
land records, milk pouring data and 
bank account verification. It aims to 
boost lending efficiency, reduce costs 
and enable quicker disbursement 
and scalability. Additionally, the 
RBI's pilot programme for Central 
Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) now 
involving thirteen Banks nationwide 
demonstrates a commitment to 
fostering digital currency adoption. 
India's fintech industry is rapidly 
growing, projected to reach US$150 
billion by 2025 reflecting the country's 
emergence as a global fintech hub 
with over 2,000 recognised FinTech 
businesses. This vibrant ecosystem 
signifies India's rapid development and 
promising opportunities for innovation 
and expansion.
In an era of rapid technological 
change, we are focused on a 
customer-centric transformation by 
leveraging AI/ML and Generative AI 
to enhance customer experiences 
and offer personalised solutions. We 
provide an omnichannel banking 
experience, ensuring seamless 
interactions across digital and 
physical platforms. Security remains 
paramount, with advanced measures 
to protect customer data. Innovations 
like UPI Lite X, conversational 
instructions, PayZapp 2.0 and 
SmartHub Vyapar enhance merchant 
empowerment. Aligned with India's

R I S K M A N A G E M E N T
With completion of the merger, the Bank has expanded the coverage of its risk management framework to include the

Management function within the Risk Management Group to have a reasonable oversight on the risk management framework 
of the group entities.
HDFC Bank Limited

HDFC BANK'S RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
Risk Governance
At the apex of our risk governance 
framework lies our Board of Directors, 
responsible for supervising our risk 
management initiatives. They've 
set up the Risk Policy & Monitoring 
Committee (RPMC) to ensure our risk 
strategy is effectively implemented. 
The RPMC guides the development 
of policies, procedures, and systems, 
constantly assessing their suitability 
for our evolving business landscape.
Heading the independent Risk 
Management Group (RMG) is the Chief 
Risk Officer (CRO), who maintains 
regular communication with RPMC 
members. The RMG is responsible for 
executing the approved risk strategy, 
developing policies, procedures, and 
systems to manage risks effectively.
An executive committee oversees the 
nature and quantum of risks taken as 
well as risk management practices 
across the Group Entities.
Risk Frameworks and Their 
Implementation
Given the nature of our business and 
the regulatory landscape, we are 
exposed to a spectrum of risks. Among 
our principal risks are credit, market, 
liquidity, operational, cybersecurity, 
and technology risks. Moreover, our 
operations encompass compliance 
and reputation risks and ESG-related 
risks. To manage these, we've 
instituted an overarching risk appetite 
framework. We have implemented 
specific policies, limits, and triggers 
tailored to each risk category to 
operationalise our risk appetite for 
individual risk types. Furthermore, 
we've undertaken thorough measures 
to ensure proper measurement and 
management of risks inherent in the 
activities integrated through the merger 
within our framework. Our structured 
management framework, the Internal 
Capital Adequacy Assessment 
Process (ICAAP), is designed to 
identify, assess, and manage all risks 
that could significantly affect our 
business, financial position, or capital 
adequacy. It helps us systematically 
analyse and address these risks to 
ensure the stability and soundness 
of our operations, protecting our 
business and capital adequacy from 
potential threats.
Ensuring informed decision-making, 
we regularly capture and report risk 
exposures, initiating appropriate 
mitigation measures. Additionally, we 
continuously refine our risk models 
to adapt to changing circumstances. 
To ensure independent evaluation, 
the Bank has an independent Internal 
Audit Department for assessing the 
adequacy and effectiveness of all 
internal controls, risk management 
practices, governance systems, 
and processes. 
We are intensifying our attention 
on non-financial risks by amplifying 
discussions within our Risk 
Management and Board committees. 
These discussions encompass 
compliance, personnel, technology, 
reputation risks, and others. This 
involves enhancing our policies, 
procedures, and risk assessment 
frameworks to effectively manage 
these risks, with an ongoing 
commitment to improvement. 
Furthermore, we are leveraging 
technology to automate our risk 
management processes, aiming to 
bring efficiencies, improve accuracy, 
enhance user control, and maintain 
thorough audit trails. By embracing 
technological advancements, we aim 
to strengthen our risk management 
capabilities while recognising the 
inherent risks in technology. Risks 
emanating from new-age solutions 
based on AI/ML techniques are 
comprehensively assessed through 
the lenses of Data Privacy, Data 
Security, Data Quality, Model fairness, 
and efficacy. The Risk Management 
Group independently validates relevant 
models across the Bank.

KEY RISK MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES
Acknowledging the significance of stress testing in risk management, the Bank conducts stress tests beyond standard 
scenarios. We focus on topical themes influenced by geopolitical, macroeconomic, and sectoral trends to pinpoint 
specific areas of our portfolio. This approach serves as an early warning system, prompting potential actions. Various 
stress tests have been conducted to evaluate their impact on our portfolio and identify affected borrowers. Furthermore, 
we implement various measures to mitigate global risks, as detailed below
In the last year, the Bank has 
made significant efforts to protect 
itself from potential global banking 
crises. We've put in place a strict 
credit risk assessment process, 
conducting thorough due diligence 
and continuous monitoring of our 
loan portfolio. This approach has 
enabled us to identify and tackle 
potential credit risks promptly, 
thereby minimising our exposure to 
such events.
Throughout the year, the Bank has 
taken steps to manage risks linked 
to increasing interest rates. These 
include robust risk management 
practices, diversifying our asset 
portfolio, and maintaining strong 
capital and liquidity positions. We 
stay alert, monitoring interest rate 
movements and taking proactive 
steps to handle any potential 
shocks from rising rates. 
Recently, nations and market 
participants have increasingly 
sought alternatives to the U.S. 
dollar, exploring different currencies 
or payment systems. The Bank 
is closely monitoring the ongoing 
geopolitical events and shift in 
global trade patterns to take 
necessary actions.
As part of our risk management 
strategy, we've broadly assessed 
the impact of recent developments 
in the Middle East, including the 
conflict between Hamas and Israel 
and subsequent actions, as well 
as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine 
conflict and intermittent tensions 
between China and Taiwan. While 
we don't anticipate significant direct 
impact on the Bank, we're closely 
monitoring the situation.

At a broader level, risks from climate change are typically 
divided into:
• Physical risks - Economic losses (physical damage 
to property and assets) from acute impacts on 
account of extreme weather events (floods, cyclones, 
droughts, landslides, etc) attributed to climate change, 
or long-term chronic impacts on environment such 
as rise in sea levels, increased global temperature or 
irreversible precipitation changes. 
• Transition risks - The possible process of 
adjustment to a low carbon economy and its 
possible effects on the value of financial assets 
and liabilities including the likelihood of formation of 
stranded assets.
Mitigation
We actively support the financing and investment in 
environmentally friendly technologies and 
low-carbon infrastructure projects, leveraging our 
product offerings and financial expertise to assist our 
customers and clients in transitioning to a sustainable, 
low-carbon economy.
We are pursuing this through three thematic areas 
including ESG integration in products, sustainable 
finance and portfolio emissions. These are discussed in 
detail in the subsequent chapter on ESG strategy.
Strategies
We partnered with an independent, reputable global 
agency to develop a framework for assessing climate 
transition risk at a counterparty level.
The Bank has initiated capacity-building programs 
to acquaint the Board and staff members with key 
developments in climate risk assessment.
Furthermore, the Bank has launched an internal 
pilot exercise to estimate financed emissions for its 
lending portfolio.
Operational risk arises from inadequate or failed internal 
processes, people, and systems or from external 
events. It includes risk of loss due to legal risk but 
excludes strategic and reputational risks.
Mitigation
The Bank follows a Board-approved Operational Risk 
Management Policy, detailing how operational risks 
are governed and managed. It details on a three-line 
defence system: the business line (including support 
and operations) is the first line, the Operational Risk 
Management Department (ORMD) acts as the second 
line, and Internal Audit serves as the third line. These 
teams work together to manage, monitor, and reduce 
operational risks effectively.

OUR APPROACH TO ENSURING DATA PRIVACY
Privacy Governance
At HDFC Bank, customer privacy is a priority. Our robust Governance Framework includes a 
designated privacy officer, cross-functional privacy teams and clear responsibility chains for 
privacy matters. Through proactive measures, we protect personal information, cultivate privacy 
awareness and promptly address any privacy concerns or inquiries that may arise.

Financial Institutions have an essential 
role to play in addressing sustainability 
challenges, facilitating the transition 
to a low-carbon economy, and 
stimulating sustainable development. 
There are increasing expectations 
for Banks to embrace sustainable 
practices from the perspective of 
borrower credit evaluation, making 
this a key focus area for regulators, 
investors, and other stakeholders. 
Moreover, financial products with 
environmental, social, and governance 
(ESG) elements, such as green 
bonds and social bonds are being 
curated to satisfy the increasing 
demand for sustainable investment 
options. Additionally, Banks are 
also increasingly incorporating 
ESG considerations into their risk 
management practices, including 
climate scenario analysis and climaterelated stress testing. In response 
to the growing focus on climate 
change and ESG factors, regulatory 
bodies across many jurisdictions 
are also implementing stricter 
disclosure requirements.

India's Green Push
India is increasingly recognising 
the urgency of addressing climate 
change and the necessity for 
innovative financial mechanisms to 
support sustainable green initiatives. 
Projections from the Reserve Bank 
of India indicate a need for over H85 
trillion by 2030 to align industries with 
climate regulations.
Recent policy measures aimed at 
promoting green finance highlight 
India's proactive efforts in this 
direction. One notable advancement 
is the Government of India making 
its debut in the sovereign green 
bond space, issuing sovereign green 
bonds worth H16,000 Crore in FY23 
and further increasing it to H20,000 
Crore in FY24. Aligning with these 
trends, a jump in ESG investments 
by venture capitalists has been 
observed, signifying a growing 
interest in sustainable financing. 
Taking this forward, Banks and 
other lending institutions are also 
working to evolve their strategies 
to actively supporting clients' 
sustainability goals, streamlining 
green financing processes, and 
encouraging businesses towards a 
low-carbon future.
The Securities and Exchange Board 
of India (SEBI) has accelerated ESG 
transition by mandating reasonable 
assurance on quantifiable metrics 
for the nine principles of National 
Guidelines on Responsible Business 
Conduct for the top 150 companies 
starting in FY24 which shall be 
gradually extended to the top 1,000 
listed entities by FY27. Building on 
a decade of promoting sustainable 
development in banking, the Reserve 
Bank of India (RBI) has also intensified 
its focus on climate-related issues in 
the past years, demonstrated through 
release of a discussion paper, "Climate 
Risk and Sustainable Finance," 
in July 2022, and more recently 
through release of draft guidelines on 
climate-related financial disclosures in 
February 2024.
Our ESG Strategy
The evolving landscape of ESG 
integration in the Banking sector 
necessitates a holistic approach 
that encompasses ESG aligned 
decision-making not only for our 
internal operational practices, but also 
extending beyond onto our external 
financing activities.
At HDFC Bank, we are committed 
to aligning our strategy with global 
benchmarks. Our previously 
established Social & Environment 
Monitoring System (SEMS) Framework 
for credit risk assessment for financing 
large industrial/infrastructure projects 
has now been replaced by a detailed 
“ESG & Climate Change Assessment 
Framework”. This framework operates 
under the auspices of our “ESG Risk 
Management Policy”, for integration 
of borrower’s current ESG stance and 
climate transition plans in our credit 
appraisal process. As we progress, we 
are also engaging with our wholesale 
borrowers to understand their current 
ESG strategy and long- term climate 
transition plans, with a view to tailor 
our corporate loan portfolio towards 
climate-sensitive financing.
To strengthen our strategy for climate 
risk assessments and tracking 
financed emissions, we are proactively 
aligning our sustainability and climate 
reporting frameworks to increasingly 
integrate best practices and comply 
with the extant regulations in the 
jurisdictions in which we operate. 
This keeps us abreast of the latest 
developments and practices in 
climate-related risk management, and 
serves as guidance to reshape our 
business model and operations across 
different geographies.
In managing our internal operational 
practices, capturing ESG performance 
data remains one of our top priorities, 
albeit a significant challenge. This 
challenge stems from the distributed 
nature of our operations and is 
compounded by the diverse formats 
for data recording and the sheer 
volume of data to be recorded. 
We continuously engage with 
stakeholders to communicate ESG 
requirements and refine our data 
collection processes to progressively 
enhance data completeness and 
accuracy to better align with various 
reporting frameworks and formats 
such as the BRSR, GRI, IR, etc., while 
obtaining external assurance for key 
ESG performance metrics.
Three years ago, we made a strategic 
commitment to achieve carbon 
neutrality on our own operations by 
FY32. We have, since developed 
and implemented a framework to 
guide us towards this goal amidst our 
expanding operations. The merger 
with erstwhile HDFC Ltd., in FY24, 
while unlocking exciting growth 
opportunities, has also prompted us to 
holistically reassess our performance 
milestones and adapt our course 
of action, ensuring that our carbon 
neutrality strategy remains aligned 
with this expansion.
To reduce emissions from all our 
operating locations, we continue 
to make informed investments 
encompassing operational and 
technological measures including IT 
capabilities and IT-enabled solutions. 
We shall continuously leverage these 
investments to optimise our data 
architecture and data governance 
practices, ensuring robust data 
collection strategies for informed 
decision-making.

empower local communities through 
collaborative partnerships and 
targeted programs.
Moreover, we are emphasising 
reporting on measurable ESG 
performance within our value chain to 
ensure the sustainability values of our 
suppliers and partners resonate with 
ours. We are actively working towards 
integrating these ESG principles as 
per BRSR Core guidelines into our 
partnerships and will report on our 
progress on the same.
Our Approach
Our ESG strategy encompasses 
people, customers, lending, and 
governance for long-term value 
creation for all stakeholders.
Effective corporate governance acts 
as a binding force that integrates 
and supports our organisational 
ESG efforts by providing formalised 
processes, and structures that 
guide our decision-making and 
accountability to ensure successful 
integration of both internal and external 
ESG initiatives within the organisation. 
Our ESG initiatives are overseen by the 
CSR & ESG Committee of the Board. 
A separate ESG apex council at the 
management level, comprising senior 
members from various functions, 
reports to the CSR & ESG Committee 
and provides regular updates to 
the Board for annual review. This 
Committee is further supported by 
ESG Working Groups including the 
Environment Working Group which 
oversees the environmental impact 
from our operations; the Social and 
Governance Working Group which 
works on workplace policies and 
governance initiatives; and the Product 
Responsibility Working Group which 
looks at ESG risks (including climate 
risks) in the existing portfolio and ESGlinked opportunities.
We are in the process of setting out 
specific and measurable targets 
aligned with our business operations 
and portfolio to track and evaluate 
our progress, and report on the same 
to the CSR and ESG Committee 
of the Board through thorough 
consultations with ESG Council and 
Working Groups. We also intend to 
accelerate the scale and pace of 
delivering value by using collaboration 
as a mechanism to effectively foster 
strategic partnerships with solution 
providers, civil societies, government 
agencies that would help us bring 
together capabilities and resources to 
achieve our ESG objectives.

Sustainable Finance
Sustainable finance is an organic 
continuum of our ESG strategy. The 
ESG strategy has set the foundation 
for the Bank to channel its resources 
towards sustainable projects. With 
ESG gaining momentum as a key 
factor in business decision making, 
the Bank is leveraging sustainable 
finance as one of its key ESG 
strategies in the form of enhanced 
environmental and social due diligence 
in lending and investment decisions 
thematic investing, ESG engagement 
and sustainable finance frameworks.
Directing capital towards sustainable 
projects allows us to integrate ESG as 
the fundamental determinant in our 
core lending strategy, and generate a 
positive impact through our business 
model. Being one of the key players 
in the banking industry, we recognise 
our role in facilitating the transition to 
a low-carbon economy. With our panIndia presence and strong customer 
relationships, we aim to drive positive 
change by promoting environmentally 
friendly technologies and financing 
sustainable infrastructure projects.
We actively support the financing 
and investment in environmentallyfriendly technologies and low-carbon 
infrastructure projects, leveraging 
our product offerings and financial 
expertise to assist our customers and 
clients in transitioning to a sustainable, 
low-carbon economy.
The Bank has identified its products 
as one of the foremost business 
focus areas wherein ESG risks, and 
opportunities will be considered 
for improvement in systems and 
processes, taking into account 
the expectations from various 
stakeholders including investors 
and regulators.
The Bank is pursuing this through 
three thematic areas including ESG 
integration in products, sustainable 
finance and portfolio emissions. As the 
next step, long-term targets to strive to 
contribute to a more sustainable future 
are being set.
ESG Integration in Products
We have adopted a robust fivedimensional approach for steadily 
incorporating ESG factors into 
the design, development, and 
management of our products with 
the aforementioned “Environmental 
Social Governance Risk Management 
Policy”. This integration is guided 
by our board approved ESG Risk 
Management Policy that overlooks 
assessment, management and 
monitoring of material ESG risks in 
our lending portfolio in line with global 
ESG / Climate Change assessment 
standards and practices.
“ESG Risk Management” framework, 
is a part of the overall credit 
assessment process for our wholesale 
corporate borrowers and has replaced 
the erstwhile “SEMS Framework”. 
This framework under the aegis of 
our ESG Risk Management Policy 
ensures thorough Environmental and 
Social Due Diligence of various loan 
proposals above the defined credit 
exposure thresholds, including direct 
customer loans (exceeding H100 
Crore), wholesale loans (ranging from 
H50 Crore to 100 Crore), supply chain 
finance, offshore, and capital market 
loans (exceeding H50 Crore), as well as 
loans to banks, financial institutions, or 
NBFCs (exceeding H50 Crore).
For large project financing 
transactions, particularly those that 
are specialised and long-term, we 
conduct additional due diligence 
beyond the standard borrower-level 
assessment carried out in all Credit 
Approval Memorandums (CAMs). 
This involves the engagement of a 
Lenders' Independent Engineer (LIE) 
who evaluates various environmental 
and social aspects pertinent to 
the transaction. The LIE Report 
encapsulates identified risks along 
with suggested mitigation measures. 
Pre-disbursement compliance 
mandates the implementation of 
these measures, which are then 
continuously monitored throughout 
the project's implementation phase. 
Should any adverse developments 
arise, corrective action is 
promptly taken.
Under the revised framework, the 
assessment of ESG and climate 
change risks is also conducted basis 
borrower's overall ESG performance 
and climate change risks in relation 
to our total loan portfolio. This applies 
when our aggregate credit appetite 
surpasses a certain threshold, 
instead of evaluating each loan 
individually. The primary objective 
of this assessment is to evaluate 
the borrower's current position 
regarding ESG and climate change 
considerations so that we can analyze 
their transition plans and initiatives for 
mitigating risks associated with these 
factors. This assessment becomes a 
mandatory section included in Credit

The Bank has also been focusing 
on providing requisite training and 
capacity building to internal credit and 
relationship teams to equip them with 
the necessary knowledge on ESG and 
the assessment templates, to help 
them better evaluate these proposals.
Additional diligence for Large 
Project Financing Transactions
For specialised, long-term project 
financing, in addition to the above 
assessment which is carried out at 
borrower level in all CAMs, Lenders’ 
Independent Engineer (LIE) assesses 
various environmental and social 
issues related to the transaction 
and the various identified risks and 
suggested mitigation measures 
are captured in an LIE Report. 
Implementation of necessary 
safeguards to address potential risks 
is a pre-requisite for disbursement 
of funds. Post disbursement, these 
safeguards are monitored on an ongoing basis and corrective actions are 
taken where required.
Client Engagement
As the largest private sector Indian 
Bank, our role is to create awareness 
amongst our borrowers, thereby 
encouraging them to measure and 
disclose their footprint. This would 
eventually reflect in our Scope 3 
emissions and help us move towards 
a net-zero portfolio commitment. As 
a part of the regular credit monitoring 
process, Credit and Relationship 
teams regularly engage with 
customers to assess the operational 
and financial performance of the 
Borrower. Through this assessment, 
relevant issues on the environmental & 
social front are discussed. The impact 
of climate change on the borrower’s 
operations are also covered.
We understand that there are 
opportunities in transitioning to a netzero economy, but the ecosystem (in 
the country) needs to be developed 
to take up such opportunities. The 
Bank has been engaging with its large 
corporate customers specifically those 
with businesses in “hard to abate” 
industries. The purpose of these 
engagements is to identify current 
ESG & Climate change related focus 
areas/practices and to identify best 
practices and emerging initiatives 
being taken by industry players on 
ESG and climate risk related issues 
including, but not limited to:
• Short term emission reduction 
targets and long-term net-zero goals
• Practices with respect 
to hazardous/ polluting 
waste management
• ESG & climate related disclosures
• Supply chain decarbonisation

Inclusion of Terms & Conditions 
Related to ESG Compliance in 
Facility Documentation
As part of the Bank’s standard 
facility documentation, an addendum 
schedule has now been included, 
which comprises representations/ 
warranties/covenants agreed to, by 
the borrower on various ESG related 
issues. This schedule is included in all 
standard sanction letters.
Sustainable Finance 
Framework
Our commitment to enhancing 
our portfolio from a climate and 
ESG perspective is reflected in the 
development of our Sustainable 
Financing Criteria Framework (“the 
Framework”). This Board approved 
framework, is intended to issue green, 
social and sustainability bonds, 
originate loans, and use the proceeds 
to finance or refinance projects 
that are expected to facilitate the 
transition to a low-carbon economy 
and advance socio-economic 
development in India.
The framework aligns with the 
overall sustainability strategy of the 
Bank and is robust, transparent, 
and harmonised with the four core 
components of the Sustainability Bond 
Guidelines 2021 (SBG), Green Bond 
Principles 2021 (GBP), Social Bond 
Principles 2021 (SBP), Green Loan 
Principles 2023 (GLP), and Social 
Loan Principles 2023 (SLP). It aims 
to identify facilities within our credit 
portfolio where financing has been 
provided to borrowers in industries 
meeting sustainable lending criteria, 
categorising such credit facilities as 
either "green" or "social" facilities. 
Developed with guidance from the 
Bond Principles by the International 
Capital Markets Association (ICMA) 
and Loan Principles by the Loan 
Market Association (LMA), the 
Framework establishes eligibility 
criteria across ten green categories 
and six social categories.
It outlines a process by which 
proceeds will be tracked, allocated 
and managed. We are committed to 
reporting on allocation and impact of 
the use of proceeds - including those 
contributing to the advancement of the 
UN Sustainable Development Goals 2, 
3 ,4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13.

Metrics and Targets
In alignment with the regulatory 
developments and stakeholder 
expectations, we continuously strive 
to identify material key performance 
indicators (KPIs) for reporting our 
environmental performance. We 
maintain a vigilant monitoring 
system for the identified KPIs and 
for the outcomes of new initiatives 
across all our operations. These 
KPIs encompass metrics related to 
energy consumption, greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions, water usage, and 
waste management.
The valuable insights drawn from the 
monitored data are used for decisionmaking and target-setting that propels 
us forward in our sustainability journey. 
We are expanding our reach by 
opening new branches, particularly 
in unbanked semi-urban and rural 
areas; this expansion necessitates 
increased investment in infrastructure, 
personnel and technology to fortify 
data collection across all locations 
– which remains an instrumental 
component of our progress towards 
our sustainability goals.
Three years ago, the Bank set an 
ambitious goal of achieving carbon 
neutrality on emissions from its own 
operations by FY32. Our recent 
successful merger and expansion 
is a significant achievement, which 
necessitates revisiting our strategy 
to ensure continued progress. While 
the FY32 target remains unchanged, 
the expansion has temporarily 
impacted data comparability between 
the current year and previous 
years – necessitating a potential 
adjustment to our interim targets on 
energy and emissions to reflect our 
growing footprint. 
Our Energy Performance
As a service-based industry, energy 
plays a critical role in our operations. In 
FY24, we consumed 3.03 million GJ of 
energy – which has increased by 1.06 
million GJ on account of our increased 
operational footprint.

Notes:
• Energy consumed from fuels include 
energy from consumption of petrol 
and diesel in company-owned vehicles 
and gensets. 
• For gensets and company-owned vehicles, 
petrol/diesel purchase data is extracted 
from the Bank’s financial records and 
the cost of petrol/diesel purchased is 
converted into litres of petrol/diesel using 
state-wise/national average rates derived 
from information in the public domain. 
• Electricity consumption from local grids 
is considered for (i) branches, offices 
and ATMs from financial records through 
spent based approach and (ii) data 
centers on actual consumption. Electricity 
consumption from renewable energy 
sources is (i) generated through in-house 
solar rooftops installed at 25 locations 
and (ii) purchased ‘green’ energy for 
12 locations.
While some of our operations do 
use fossil fuel as primary energy 
(such as in generators for backup 
purposes and in company owned 
vehicles), majority (83.59%) of our 
energy consumption is in the form 
of electricity (2.54 million GJ). Most 
of this electrical energy is primarily 
procured from the grid-although we 
continue to look out for sources of 
renewable energy (RE) to replace grid 
energy, wherever feasible.

As part of our ongoing efforts to 
reduce our carbon footprint, we are 
integrating renewable energy sources 
into our power consumption, including 
through captive solar panels in certain 
offices, where feasible. Through the 
recent merger, our rooftop solar 
portfolio has expanded. We have 
now commissioned a total of 25 
rooftop solar installations (14 added 
as a result of the merger), with a total 
capacity of approximately 720 kWp, 
resulting in avoidance of 451.83 tCO2e 
emissions from the provision of 631.05

Despite a growing market for open 
access procurement of renewable 
energy, and the introduction of 
progressive rules like "Promoting 
Renewable Energy through Green 
Energy Open Access Rules, 2022, 
and Promoting Renewable Energy 
Through Green Energy Open Access 
(Second Amendment) Rules, 2023, 
there remain a number of regulatory 
and market challenges for us to scale 
up our RE procurement. Several states 
are yet to adopt the Rules in the form 
of Regulations for implementation of 
Green Energy Open Access (GEOA) 
at the state level, hindering the pace 
of adoption of open access RE 
across our locations. We consider 
it crucial to eliminate these external 
challenges to enable at-scale adoption 
of green power across our distributed 
consumption centres.
Buildings Management and 
Green Buildings: To support our 
decarbonisation efforts, we are 
actively engaged in reducing energy 
consumption across all aspects 
of our operations. This objective is 
achieved through a multifaceted 
approach, including the regulation 
of existing equipment, installation 
of energy-efficient alternatives, and 
the implementation of automated 
energy management solutions. Our 
comprehensive energy management 
and efficiency strategy encompasses 
various initiatives, reflecting our 
commitment to sustainable practices 
and mitigating climate change.
By leveraging digital systems and data 
analytics, we gain valuable insights 
into energy consumption patterns. 
Our focus extends to maintaining 
branches at optimal temperatures, 
improving power efficiency and 
automating energy-consuming 
assets. These initiatives enable us 
to optimise energy usage, enhance 
operational efficiency and reduce our 
environmental footprint.
In FY24, the Bank accounted for 
electricity consumption from all four 
of our co-located data centers. We 
are also implementing measures 
to increase the energy efficiency of 
our data centres which also leads to 
operational efficiency enhancement.

E N V I R O N M E N T
We have incorporated several changes 
within our infrastructure to improve 
energy efficiency through auto controls 
& environment-friendly equipment, 
and have installed centrally controlled 
energy management system in about 
568 branches across India as on date. 
This system has allowed us to control 
consumption patterns, resulting in 
savings to the tune of 16 per cent 
annually on an average. 
We are using technology and 
innovation as facilitators in our journey 
towards low-carbon growth. We have 
implemented elevator and equipment 
scheduling to reduce our energy 
consumption. We have also installed 
occupancy sensors, capacitor banks 
as well as Building Management 
Systems at several of our operating 
locations. The energy management 
modules with auto controls deployed 
across select branches have resulted 
in significant energy savings. We have 
also piloted the use of modular UPS 
in our branches and plan to scale it 
further. Additionally, all air conditioners 
in our new premises will conform to 
the latest standards developed by 
Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE).
Moving beyond energy consumption, 
we have taken it upon ourselves to 
implement other green measures 
including waste and water 
management in our existing and new 
fit-outs. We intend to adopt a more 
holistic approach towards reducing 
our environmental footprint at our 
operating locations. As of March 
31, 2024, a total of 2,026 projects 
in different cities are certified under 
the Green Interiors Rating System 
of the Indian Green Building Council 
(IGBC). We intend to ensure that all 
our upcoming branches are evaluated 
for green building certification. 
IGBC's comprehensive rating 
modules encompassing Eco Design 
Approach, Interior Materials, Water 
Conservation, Indoor Environment, 
Energy Efficiency, and Innovation in 
Interior Design have been diligently 
implemented and met with excellence 
throughout our certified branches 
and offices. Additionally, some of our 
offices are also LEED certified. We 
prioritise environmental sustainability 
and have been using GreenPro 
certified materials such as plywood, 
laminates, flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, 
paints, adhesives, finishes, and 
equipment at our select locations. 
Additionally, we include low VOCs 
(Volatile Organic Compounds) finishes 
in our Bills of Quantity and contractor 
tendering process.
GHG Emissions 
We are dedicated to playing our part 
in addressing climate change and 
promoting sustainable practices not 
only within our operations but also 
throughout our value chain. However, 
collecting complete and accurate 
activity data from our myriad locations 
of varying sizes and nature, is one 
of our key challenges and hence 
a strategic priority action area for 
us. We are continuously enhancing 
our data collection processes and 
exploring suitable technological / 
automation solutions to collect data 
and enhance stakeholder confidence 
on completeness & accuracy of 
our inventory.
In FY24, our total Scope 1 and 21 
footprint stood at 0.59 million tCO2e.

77.33 per cent, and Scope 3 
emissions accounted for 9.70 per cent 
of our total reported emissions. 
In our ongoing efforts to enhance 
completeness of our GHG inventory, 
in FY24, we expanded our Scope 1 
inventory to include fugitive emissions 
from Air Conditioners (ACs) and 
Fire Extinguishers (FEs). Together, 
these two new sources contribute 
over 50 per cent of our total Scope 
1 emissions. Out of the total Scope 
1 emissions, fugitive emissions from 
ACs contribute 53.00 per cent, 
followed by emissions from fuel 
consumption in company-owned 
vehicles with a share of 23.93 per 
cent. Emissions from fuel consumption 
in gensets emerge as the third-largest 
contributor with a share of 19.21 per 
cent in the total Scope 1 emissions, 
followed by fugitive emissions from fire 
extinguishers accounting for a share of 
3.87 per cent. 
Our Scope 2 emissions encompass 
emissions associated with electricity 
purchased from the grid at all locations 
that are under the operational control 
of the Bank as well as our co-located 
data centers. We are continuously 
taking measures to seek ways to 
reduce our Scope 2 emissions 
through interventions in our own 
operations and through collaboration 
with our data center service providers. 
We report our Scope 2 emissions 
using location-based as well as 
market-based approach as per the 
WRI GHG Protocol.
Electricity consumption at our other 
ATMs3, along with emissions on 
account of air travel, car/cab travel, 
train travel, paper waste, battery 
waste, and e-waste generated 
contribute to our reported Scope 3 
emissions that cover Categories 5, 6, 
and 8 as per the Technical Guidance 
for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions 
(version 1.0) by WRI Greenhouse 
Gas Protocol.
Our Scope 1 emissions increased 
from 0.03 million tCO2e in FY23 
to 0.09 million tCO2e in FY24. 
This rise is primarily attributed to 
inclusion of two new sources of 
fugitive GHG emissions - ACs and 
fire extinguishers, apart from some 
increase on account of increased 
fuel consumption in companyowned vehicles due to increased 
employee activity during the 
reporting period.

In FY24, we witnessed an increase 
of 0.20 million tCO2e in Scope 2 
emissions despite 3,270.23 MWh 
of our electricity consumption 
having renewable energy attributes 
(generated from solar rooftop and 
procured through green tariff). This 
increase can be attributed to several 
factors including an increase in 
the number of locations under our 
operational control on account of 
merger with eHDFC Limited with effect 
from July 1, 2023 and our rapidly 
increasing geographical footprint to 
serve underbanked regions. Further, 
as a result of the merger in order to 
ensure uniformity across our reporting 
boundary, the Bank used a spendbased approach for estimation of 
procured electricity. 
We are using actual electricity 
procurement data for our data 
centers which contributes to 4.18

Measures to Reduce GHG 
Emissions
We remain committed to implementing 
meaningful and system-driven 
changes within the organisation to 
reduce the GHG intensity of our 
operations. Three years ago, we set a 
bold goal: achieving carbon neutrality 
for our Scope 1 & 2 emissions by 
FY32. To that end, we have adopted 
firm-level guidelines for operations and 
procurement encompassing supplyside and demand-side interventions; 
and established a carbon neutrality 
pathway to guide our progress, 
even as our operations have grown. 
The recent merger with eHDFC Ltd. 
presents exciting opportunities for 
growth, while also necessitating 
a strategic review of our carbon 
neutrality strategy. The observed 
increase in Scope 1 & 2 greenhouse 
gas emissions prompts us to adopt 
a more holistic approach. We will be 
reviewing our baseline emissions and 
setting a new, post-merger baseline in 
alignment with base year recalculation 
methodologies of the WRI Greenhouse 
Gas Protocol. This comprehensive 
review and realignment will allow us 
to continuously adapt and strengthen 
our efforts.

emissions from air conditioners and 
fire extinguishers.
• Two sources of GHG emissions i.e. Air 
Conditioners and Fire Extinguishers have 
been included for Scope 1 emissions for 
FY 2023-24, which were not included in 
Scope 1 emissions for FY 2022-23
• For the computation of emissions from 
company-owned cars and gensets, 
emission factors from IPCC guidelines 
2006 have been applied to quantities 
deemed for energy consumption in ‘Our 
Energy Performance’ section.
• Fugitive emissions for fire extinguishers are 
estimated using operational database and 
public factors on leakage from USEPA's 
guidance, with GWP values derived from 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change Sixth Assessment Report (IPCC 
AR6).
• For air conditioners, the Bank’s Fixed 
Asset Register for ACs sets the boundary, 
with asset characteristics derived from 
internal databases. Emissions have 
been calculated using India's refrigerant 
trends, average capacity of refrigerant as 
provided by vendors, refrigerant leakage 
as considered from Council on Energy, 
Environment and Water (CEEW) and 
GWP derived from IPCC AR 6. Scope 
2 emissions are reported using marketbased approach with grid emission factor 
from Version 19 of the Central Electrical 
Authority’s CO2 database.
For Scope 3 GHG emissions, the Bank 
reports on the below categories:
• Business travel through air and rail: The 
distance travelled is estimated using 
sources available in the public domain. 
The applicable emission factors have been 
sourced from India Specific Air Transport 
Emission Factors, 2015 for domestic, 
Department for Environment, Food & Rural 
Affairs (DEFRA) 2023 for international and 
India Specific Rail Transport Emission 
Factors, 2015 for rail.
• Business Travel (Cab Hire): The distance 
is calculated using estimates of applicable 
taxi fares available in the public domain. 
For travel within India, the applicable 
emission factors have been sourced from 
India Specific Road Transport Emission 
Factors, 2015. For travel outside India, 
emission factors for average diesel cars 
from DEFRA have been considered.
• Emissions from e-waste, paper waste and 
battery waste have been considered. To 
calculate emissions, recycling emission 
factors and conservative emission factors 
for disposal have been sourced from 
WARM Version 16, EPA 2023. For the 
computation of waste quantities, refer 
notes given under BRSR Principle 6, 
Essential Indicators: Question 9.
• Emissions from 'other ATMs' (i.e. electricity 
consumption for ATMs with no operational 
control): Electricity consumption at these 
locations has been derived using internally 
derived benchmarks (i.e. Geo-climatic 
averages of kWh consumption from other 
offsite ATMs).

Our Carbon Neutrality Pathway
Actions Taken in FY24
Demonstrating our unwavering commitment 
to environmental sustainability, we have set an 
ambitious goal of achieving carbon neutrality for our 
Scope 1 & 2 emissions by FY32. Our performance 
against our interim targets for FY24 is illustrated in 
the figure below. With our ever-expanding footprint, 
we acknowledge the challenges on our path to 
carbon neutrality.
While our ultimate target for FY32 remains 
unchanged, recent, unanticipated changes in our 
organisational structure have necessitated a review 
of our carbon neutrality strategy and its various 
milestones and levers. Therefore, we will be realigning 
our interim targets to account for our enhanced 
organisational boundary (following the merger with 
eHDFC Limited as well as the enhanced operational 
boundary (new sources of Scope 1 emissions and 
increased physical footprint). 
E N V I R O N M E N T
This year, we actively implemented our carbon 
neutrality strategy, focusing on both demand-side 
and supply-side initiatives. While some measures 
were introduced later in the reporting period, we are 
confident they will translate to significant emission 
reductions starting in the near future.

As a responsible bank, we recognise our impact on the environment beyond our core operations. While we diligently address 
emissions within our operating boundary, we also acknowledge the importance of taking measures outside our direct 
operations. We have thus, prioritised two key aspects that have a direct impact on reducing GHG emissions within our value 
chain: paper waste reduction and tree plantation.
Our digital products 
and services, along 
with automation of 
several internal as 
well as customerlinked processes 
and channels, 
have enabled us 
to reduce paper 
waste generation. 
The ‘Green Event 
Guidelines’ rolled 
out by our retail 
marketing team has 
helped save about 
58.09 lakh sq. ft. 
of paper during the 
reporting period.
We have launched 
an ambitious 
tree plantation 
initiative and 
have successfully 
planted over 30 
lakh trees to date. 
This program has 
not only resulted 
in significant 
reductions in our 
GHG emissions but 
has also served 
as a catalyst 
for enhancing 
our social and 
relationship capital.
Our digitised 
processes and 
products have 
helped customers 
reduce their 
frequency of visits 
to the Bank’s 
branches, ATMs, 
and offices - thereby 
reducing associated 
emissions.
Where paper use 
is unavoidable, 
we are switching 
to recycled paper. 
In FY24, recycled 
paper constituted 
7.07% of our total 
paper procurement 
which reduces the 
upstream emissions 
associated with 
paper procurement.
We made an ecoconscious effort 
of responsibly 
disposing flex 
materials from 
eHDFC Ltd's 
signage transition 
to HDFC Bank. To 
prevent unintended 
reuse, we 
collaborated with 
signage converters 
to deliver all our 
6.76 tonnes of 
flex waste to the 
cement plants for 
environmentally 
friendly coprocessing, setting 
a pioneering 
example.

Waste Management
Our goal is to work progressively 
towards sustainable management 
of the waste generated from our 
operations. We are in the advanced 
stage of formalising the internal 
standard operating procedures for 
monitoring and reporting of waste 
generated as well as waste avoided. 
The roles and responsibilities of 
various functional departments 
have been defined to improve data 
governance and management with an 
aim to minimise waste generation and 
enhance the share of waste recycled.
As the first step towards improved 
environmental stewardship, we are 
progressively enhancing the quality 
and accuracy of our sustainability 
disclosures. This includes reporting 
waste generation and disposal by enduse for various categories.

 From FY24 onwards, battery waste is being 
reported separately. Battery waste is centrally 
managed and recycled through vendors.
Paper waste majorly constitutes paper 
procured for the Bank’s own use and is 
shown as sector-specific paper waste. The 
quantity of waste generated is assumed to be 
disposed through other disposal operations.
Generation of plastic waste, hazardous 
waste, some quantities of paper & e-waste 
and non-hazardous waste are extrapolated 
based on actual data collected at select 
locations and the quantity of waste generated 
is assumed to be disposed through other 
disposal operations.
We recognise our responsibility and 
strive to ensure that all these wastes 
are disposed responsibly. 
Responsible waste management is 
critical to minimising our environmental 
footprint. This includes minimising 
waste generation, promoting 
responsible disposal practices, 
and ensuring proper handling 
and processing. 
We achieve this through partnerships 
with authorised recycling vendors for 
various waste streams. Furthermore, 
we are actively expanding our waste 
tracking program. Through internal 
consultations and collaboration with 
vendors, we will progressively track 
dry waste across more facilities over 
the next few years. We recycled 
109.74 tonnes of e-waste and 20.51 
tonnes of batteries n FY24, all handled 
by authorised recyclers. 
At some of our locations, used diesel 
oil is produced due to the operation 
of gensets which is classified as 
hazardous waste and disposed using 
approved, authorised vendors.

Water Conservation
Reflecting the nature of our business, 
our water consumption is primarily 
for domestic purposes and drinking. 
We obtain water from municipal or 
third-party suppliers at most of our 
locations. Effective water management 
requires accurate assessment 
of performance data. We will be 
prioritising measuring and monitoring 
water usage across our facilities, 
with a focus on larger sites first. 
This phased approach allows us to 
gather data, refine our strategy, and 
gradually expand meter coverage in 
the coming years.
As we continue to strengthen 
our systems for monitoring water 
consumption, we are also working 
on reducing our overall water usage 
through the implementation of watersaving practices and technologies. 
In our IGBC-certified branches, 
all washrooms are equipped with 
low-flow fixtures and sensor-based 
urinals with a flow rate of 1 to 1.5 
liters per flush. Our total estimated 
water consumption5 for FY24 is 
approximately 4,81,615.63 kl.
The wastewater generated by the 
Bank is sent to third party.
Besides our operation, we also have 
an impact outside our operational 
boundaries by working with 
communities to conserve water and 
to rejuvenate water bodies. The 
details of this can be found in our 
‘Social- Communities’ chapter.

Climate Risk-related 
Disclosures
In response to the escalating urgency 
of climate change, various sectors are 
adapting to new regulatory landscapes 
to mitigate environmental impacts. The 
global fight against climate change 
has led to the advent of regulations 
like Carbon Border Adjustment 
Mechanism (CBAM). This has spurred 
India to create a regulated carbon 
market, paving the way for the Carbon 
Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS), 
under the Energy Conservation 
Act. This scheme envisages both, 
compliance and the development of 
a voluntary carbon market. Some of 
the operational guidelines for CCTS 
are currently work-in-progress. 
To navigate this new landscape, 
organisations need to reassess 
their climate risks and become 
more climate transparent. Global 
guidelines like the IFRS S2 standard, 
which subsumes the Task Force on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD) recommendations, present a 
framework for such disclosures.
Recognising the growing concerns 
of regulators, investors, and clients 
regarding climate risks, particularly 
for banks and financial institutions, 
the Bank has been reporting on 
governance, risks and opportunities, 
strategy as well as metrics and 
emission reduction targets linked to 
climate change.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has 
issued various draft guidelines on 
such disclosures, the latest one being 
the Draft Disclosure framework on 
Climate-related Financial Risks, 2024 
published on February 28, 2024.
We are continuously striving to align 
ourselves to make increased climate 
risk related disclosures.
Governance
Board Oversight
The Board of Directors have 
increased their oversight on climaterelated issues. The CSR and ESG 
Committee of the Board oversees 
the Bank’s sustainability and climate 
change initiatives. This Committee 
monitors the ESG framework, the 
Environmental Policy, actionables and 
initiatives strategised and executed 
by the management level ESG Apex 
Council and the ESG Working Groups. 
The Committee also maintains 
an oversight over the Bank’s ESG 
disclosures, highlighting the Bank’s 
ESG performance and prioritisation 
of material topics. A dedicated ESG 
vertical that works in conjunction 
with several internal and external 
stakeholders, to drive the Bank’s 
ESG agenda including managing, 
mitigating, and reporting on climate 
metrics. The Deputy Managing 
Director of the Bank has direct 
oversight on the ESG function and 
reports to the Board on such matters.
The Bank has initiated capacitybuilding programs to acquaint our 
staff members with key developments 
in climate risk assessment. Credit 
officers assess overall E&S risks, 
especially climate risks through a 
comprehensive “ESG and Climate 
Change Assessment” framework, as 
a part of the overall credit assessment 
for select wholesale corporate

borrowers with exposures above a 
specified threshold as defined in the 
ESG Risk Management Policy. 
Further, the Bank has partnered with 
an independent, reputable global 
agency to develop a framework for 
assessing climate transition risk at 
a counter-party level. The Bank has 
launched an internal pilot exercise to 
estimate financed emissions.
During FY24, the Board received 
regular updates on matters such 
as key government and regulatory 
policy, regulatory engagement and 
ESG matters including areas such 
as progress on our climate strategy, 
policy updates, industry trends, 
stakeholder engagement and targetsetting.
The Board members participate in 
dedicated familiarisation sessions 
to enhance their understanding 
of emerging climate related risks 
impacting the Bank and the adequacy 
of actions for management of 
the identified risks. In FY24, two 
meetings were conducted for the 
Board on emerging regulations and 
best practices related to ESG and 
climate risk management. The CSR 
and ESG Committee of the Board 
meets on a quarterly basis. During the 
year, the Risk Policy and Monitoring 
Committee also reviewed key risks 
and opportunities arising from 
climate change.
Policies and Frameworks Guiding 
Climate Risk Management
HDFC Bank’s approach to identifying 
climate-related risks, impacts, 
and opportunities is guided by 
the Board-approved ESG, Risk 
Management Policy (ESGRM Policy), 
Operational Risk Management Policy, 
Sustainable Finance Framework 
and the Environmental Policy. 
E N V I R O N M E N T
These policies inter alia inform 
the categorisation of risks and 
implementation of risk mitigation and 
management measures.
Specifically, the Bank’s ESGRM 
Policy addresses climate transition 
and mitigation plans and includes 
a prohibition list criterion and 
‘Category-A’ tagging of climate riskrelated vulnerable sectors. As part of 
this policy, we use our ESG & Climate 
Change Assessment Framework as a 
part of the overall credit assessment 
for certain wholesale borrowers as per 
the ESGRM Policy. Under this policy, 
the Credit Appetite Memorandum 
assesses ESG and climate change 
risks associated with the borrowers’ 
operations and mitigation measures/
controls.
The framework also captures various 
aspects of ESG compliance and 
climate change risks/mitigants in 
relation to the borrower, and their 
business operations. Through 
the framework, risk exposures 
are identified and reported to 
management, thus enabling the 
implementation of necessary risk 
mitigation actions.
The Board-approved Operational 
Risk Management Policy outlines the 
governance structure and processes 
for managing operational risk. This 
structure consists of three lines of 
defense: the business line (including 
support and operations) is the first 
line, an independent Operational Risk 
Management Department (ORMD) 
is the second line, and Internal Audit 
is the third line. The Risk Policy and 
Monitoring Committee (RPMC) of the 
Board oversees the risk management 
strategy of the Bank and ultimately 
reports to the Board of Directors.
The Bank had also implemented 
a Board-approved ESG policy 
framework, a guiding document 
for all ESG initiatives and activities 
undertaken by the Bank, focusing 
on climate change strategy, 
environmental and social risk 
management in lending, procurement 
practices, workforce and employment 
practices, good governance, and 
stakeholder management.
We have developed a Sustainable 
Financing Framework in line 
with International Capital Market 
Association (ICMA) Green Bond 
Principles 2021, Social Bond 
Principles 2023, and Sustainability 
Bond Guidelines 2021. This 
Framework, approved by the Bank’s 
CSR and ESG Committee, the RPMC 
and the Board of Directors, has also 
received a second-party opinion, 
concluding the credibility of the 
Framework as well as its alignment 
with global principles. This framework 
serves as a basis for the Bank’s 
on going and future Sustainable 
Financing Transactions (SFTs).
A Board-approved Stress Testing 
Policy and System, which is an 
integral aspect of our ICAAP (Internal 
Capital Adequacy Assessment 
Process), is part of our overall risk 
management framework. Stress 
testing involves employing a variety 
of ways to determine our vulnerability 
to excessive yet realistically stressful 
work conditions.
Climate risk stress testing captures 
financial impact of borrowers and 
associated credit losses due to 
physical risk and credit losses due to 
transition risk.
Committees Guiding Climate Risk 
Management
We have established a robust 
governance structure to oversee our 
ESG approach, comprising the CSR 
and ESG Committee of the Board 
HDFC Bank Limited

and the ESG Apex Council. Under 
the aegis of the Apex Council, three 
ESG working groups drive the Bank’s 
ESG agenda.
Our Board-level CSR and ESG 
Committee oversees sustainability 
and climate change initiatives, and is 
responsible for monitoring the ESG 
Policy framework, Environmental 
Policy, and other climate-related 
action plans. It ensures that the 
Bank’s ESG disclosures effectively 
communicate the Bank’s performance 
and prioritisation of material topics 
like climate change. The Committee 
reviews climate-related plans, 
targets, performance against those 
targets, and employee/business unit 
initiatives to mitigate climate change. 
Additionally, it allocates annual 
budgets for ESG initiatives. The 
CSR and ESG Committee convenes 
quarterly and discusses and updates 
on climate change initiatives and 
guides on further course of action.
The Bank has established a 
separate ESG Apex Council at the 
management level, that shapes 
and guides the Bank’s overall ESG 
strategy and provides actionable 
recommendations which are further 
reported quarterly to the Bank’s CSR 
and ESG Committee. The Council 
comprises of senior management that 
governs and reviews the progress of 
Bank’s ESG strategy and roadmap 
through three distinct working groups, 
namely Environment Working Group, 
Social & Governance Working Group, 
& Product Responsibility Working 
Group, and targets climate risk related 
governance across environment, 
social, and product dimensions.
The Bank’s comprehensive risk 
management is overseen by the 
Board of Directors. The RPMC 
is a Board-level committee that 
supervises the implementation of the 
risk strategy, has been formed as per 
the guidelines of Reserve Bank of 
India on Asset Liability Management/
Risk Management Systems. The 
RPMC monitors compliance with risk 
parameters and aggregate exposures 
within the appetite set by the Board. 
It also reviews the enterprise-wide 
risk frameworks viz. Risk Appetite 
framework (RAF), Internal Capital 
Adequacy Assessment Process 
(ICAAP), and the stress testing 
framework for the Bank’s borrowers.
The independent Risk Management 
Group (RMG) maintains regular 
communication with RPMC members 
and is primarily responsible for 
executing the risk strategy approved 
by the Board. This entails developing 
policies, procedures, and systems to 
identify, measure, monitor, assess, 
and manage risks effectively. The 
RMG is headed by the Chief Risk 
Officer who is also accountable for all 
aspects of managing operational risks.
The risk management function of the 
Bank is independent from business 
and reports directly to the Managing 
Director and Chief Executive 
Officer. The risk management team 
conducts periodic topical stress 
testing to assess the potential impact 
of geopolitical, macroeconomic, 
and sectoral trends. The Bank has 
integrated ESG considerations into its 
credit appraisal and approval process 
for select wholesale borrowers. 
encompassing environmental, health, 
social, and safety risks.

HDFC Bank Limited

Strategy
At HDFC Bank, we are committed 
to mitigating risks and leveraging 
opportunities arising from the 
transition to a low-carbon economy. 
We endeavor to build our capability to 
manage risk from climate change and 
deliver our regulatory commitments, 
thereby demonstrating to our investors 
that the Bank is effectively managing 
climate-related risks and opportunities.
Identifying Climate-related Risks 
and Opportunities
Our strategy is underpinned by the 
way we assess and manage our 
exposure to climate-related risk. 
There are two main types of climate 
related risks:
• Physical Risks: Extreme weather 
events like floods and cyclones 
can cause physical damage to 
property and assets, leading to 
economic losses (physical damage 
to property and assets). The Bank 
is assessing the potential financial 
impacts of these physical risks on 
the Bank’s operations.
• Transition Risks: The shift 
towards a low-carbon economy 
may impact the value of certain 
assets and liabilities including the 
likelihood of formation of stranded 
assets. The Bank is exploring 
opportunities in green financing and 
sustainable infrastructure projects 
to mitigate these risks and capitalise 
on emerging market trends. The 
Bank has also partnered with an 
independent, reputable global 
agency to develop a framework for 
assessing climate transition risk at a 
counterparty level.
Additionally, we have identified some climate-related risks and opportunities that the banking sector may face over the short, 
medium, and long term, as well as their corresponding impacts including:
Risk
Type of risk
Description
Current 
regulation
Transition risk 
factor
Banks are highly regulated in the country and mandates as part of current regulations 
are always integrated into the overall risk planning and assessment process. Current 
regulations are also factored in the credit assessment process, especially through the 
comprehensive ESG and Climate Change assessment framework for its wholesale 
corporate borrowers.
Emerging 
regulation
Transition risk 
factor
Transition risk can impact the Bank's credit portfolio resulting from changes in the 
climate policy, technology, consumer, and market sentiment during the transition to a 
low-carbon economy. This is particularly relevant for policy changes that can result in 
loan defaults from certain sectors like coal, thermal and certain infrastructure sectors. 
Technology
Transition risk 
factor
While our digital environment and information security standards are the foundation of 
our business today, as financial services professionals, we do not anticipate technology 
to have a significant impact on climate risk. Our low-carbon digital banking products use 
technology to enable business.
Legal
Transition risk 
factor
For large loans, we verify whether the project complies with all applicable environmental 
rules, failing to do so could result in the loan becoming a non-performing asset if the 
project goes into litigation. This, however, is not a claim against the Bank. There are no 
other circumstances in which the Bank can be held liable for a climate-related lawsuit. 
Market
Transition risk 
factor
In the context of climate change, markets could play a key role in market repricing or 
shifting the demand and supply for certain products like green loans or bonds, or in 
low-carbon digital products. However, the Bank recognises the relevance of change in 
consumer preferences, and hence, the need to evaluate this risk.

Reputation
Transition risk 
factor
Reputation risk from community/customer perception is a primary risk to our business. 
We thus invest in community and customer involvement through surveys and structured 
engagements to educate and enlighten them on climate risks and mitigation. Further, 
ESG performance measures are increasingly being used by the global investor 
community, especially sovereign wealth funds and pension funds, to assess long-term 
profitable growth. We strive to implement environment-friendly measures throughout our 
operations. We further show our commitment to ESG, particularly climate change, by 
including ESG elements in regulatory reporting such as the annual report. In addition, in 
our annual integrated report, we publish details on our carbon emissions and footprint 
(third-party assured).
Acute 
physical
Physical 
risk factor
Acute physical hazards such as cyclones, floods, and water stress can have a negative 
influence on the credit portfolio by causing bad debts, impairing assets or collaterals due 
to damage to property, infrastructure, and land, and interrupting operations. This is also 
relevant for climate disasters destroying assets (that serve as collaterals). The Bank’s 
Disaster Response and Business Continuity teams conduct business impact analyses 
and have rapid response procedures in place in the event of natural disasters such as 
floods.
Chronic 
physical
Physical 
risk factor
Chronic physical risks are far into the future. Rise in global temperature more than 1.5 
degree Celsius may cause changes in climate patterns and sea level, impacting the 
economy and operations of the Bank, thus impairing assets or causing early replacement 
of assets. Given that climate risk is an emerging and long-term risk for the Bank, a 
suitable methodology/pathway shall be considered for adoption, to analyze the Bank’s 
exposures under different climate scenarios.
HDFC Bank Limited

Building a Climate-Resilient 
Strategy
By integrating climate risk 
considerations into financial planning 
processes, the Bank is building a 
more resilient strategy. This includes 
evaluating the potential impact of 
climate change on the Bank’s lending 
practices, customer base, and 
operational costs. The Bank believes 
that this proactive approach will help 
navigate the evolving landscape 
of climate change while seizing 
opportunities for sustainable growth.
The Bank actively reports to the 
Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), 
on its strategy that integrates both 
the potential risks and opportunities 
presented by climate change. We 
understand that climate change 
provides both risks and potential 
opportunities for our business. 
From the perspective of climate risk 
assessment, we plan on assessing the 
priority of physical and transition risks 
in the near to medium term.
We have a three-pronged strategy 
to adapt to climate change: 
decarbonising our operations; 
managing climate risk & financed 
emissions; and financing the transition.
Decarbonising Our Operations
• Minimising our operational carbon 
footprint is central to the Bank’s 
sustainability strategy. 
• We are committed to effectively 
managing and mitigating the 
environmental impacts of our 
operations by adopting industry 
best practices and standards.
• Our comprehensive Scope 1 
& 2 carbon neutrality strategy 
encompasses various initiatives, 
reflecting our commitment to 
sustainable practices and mitigating 
climate change.
Managing Climate Risks
• The Bank's credit exposure is 
well diversified across numerous 
industries, with no single industry 
having a high concentration. 
• We have strengthened the 
assessment of climate risks as a 
part of credit diligence, particularly 
in project financing above a certain 
threshold under the aegis of our 
ESG Risk Management Policy. As a 
part of this framework, identification 
of exposure for Category-A tagging 
sectors (business activities with 
significant adverse environmental 
and social risks) is underway. (Refer 
to the ESG Strategy chapter). 
• We are endeavouring to develop 
more robust frameworks to measure 
and assess material climate risks 
related to our lending operations 
and apply a climate lens to more of 
our business decisions.
• We are firming up an internal 
strategy on conducting climate 
risk assessments and tracking 
our financed emissions. The Bank 
shall continue to expand the scope 
of assessment, and refine the 
methodologies basis the finalisation 
of the disclosure frameworks in 
India, including the guidelines and 
timelines put forth by the RBI. This 
shall also help in the development 
of the Bank’s targets on financed 
emissions in the future.
• We have a Business Continuity Plan 
to address and manage continuity 
of critical business operations, 
ensuring accelerated resumption of 
services after a disaster.
Financing the Transition 
• HDFC Bank's Sustainable Financing 
Framework aligned to International 
Capital Market Association (ICMA) 
Green Bond Principles 2021, 
Social Bond Principles 2023, and 
Sustainability Bond Guidelines 
2021], serves as a basis for HDFC 
Bank’s future Sustainable Financing 
Transactions (SFTs), including 
green, social & sustainability bonds 
and loans. The Framework defines 
the eligibility criteria in ten distinct 
‘green’ categories. The policy is 
available on the Bank's website.

In addition to our three-pronged 
strategy, we also engage with our 
larger corporate clients as well as 
industry bodies and regulators on 
climate change. This enables us 
to strengthen our strategy while 
ensuring a well-rounded approach to 
implementation of the same.
Client Engagement
As a trusted financial institution, we 
continue to proactively engage with 
many of our larger corporate clients 
on both the risks and opportunities 
related to their businesses. To 
enable us to provide the appropriate 
advice and capital solutions, we 
also encourage clients to share and 
enhance their climate disclosures.
Through client engagement, our 
goal is to determine current ESG 
and climate change focus areas 
and practices. We strive to identify 
industry best practices and emerging 
initiatives on ESG and climate risk 
issues, including short-term emission 
reduction targets, long-term netzero goals, ESG and climate-related 
disclosures, and supply chain 
decarbonisation. Of the wholesale 
loans approved during the year, 26 
per cent in value terms underwent an 
enhanced environmental and social 
due diligence as part of the Credit 
Appetite Memorandum.
Industry engagement/
Government/Public Policy 
Engagement
We believe that industry co-operation, 
particularly in setting common 
standards and transparent reporting, 
is important for all our stakeholders. 
We continue to engage with peers, 
industry experts and academics to 
assess the transition to a low-carbon 
economy and consider emerging 
methodologies and taxonomies. 
We are member to a number of 
industry bodies and endeavor 
to advance our climate change 
policy through such industry/
trade associations.
We actively contribute to the 
processes of influencing the 
evolution of positions taken 
by trade associations through 
advocacy and negotiations. Our 
organisational strategy and climate 
goals guide our engagement with the 
trade associations.
The Bank also intends to accelerate 
the scale and pace of delivering 
value by using collaboration as a 
mechanism to effectively foster 
strategic partnerships with solution 
providers, civil societies, government 
agencies that would help bring 
together capabilities and resources to 
achieve its ESG objectives.
Risk Management
Risk Identification
Effectively managing climate risk 
requires proactive identification, 
a thorough understanding of the 
domain, as well as comprehensive 
inputs from stakeholders. At the 
Bank, risk identification is an 
ongoing process that includes the 
consideration of climate-related 
factors such as physical (acute and 
chronic) and transition risks in the 
lending portfolio. We are actively 
seeking opportunities to enhance our 
capabilities in identifying these risks 
and their impacts on our business and 
endeavor to incorporate additional 
climate risk considerations related 
to sector, product, and geography, 
aligning specific perils and transition 
categories, linking new and existing 
risks to other sustainability categories, 
and identifying the applicable time 
horizons for impacts.
Climate-related Risk 
Management
In line with its sustainabilityfocused vision and commitments, 
the Bank has developed several 
initiatives to manage climate-related 
risks at the project, portfolio, and 
organisational levels.
Project Risk
At a project level, a risk assessment 
focused on social and environmental 
aspects is integrated into the Bank’s 
overall credit approval framework. 
The Bank’s ESG & Climate Change 
Assessment Framework, under the 
aegis of our ESG Risk Management 
Policy (ESGRM), ensures thorough 
environmental and social due 
diligence of various loan proposals 
above the defined credit exposure 
thresholds, including direct customer 
loans, wholesale loans, supply chain 
finance, offshore, and capital market 
loans, as well as loans to banks, 
financial institutions, or NBFCs. 
This assessment helps the Bank 
evaluate the borrower's current 
position regarding ESG and climate 
change considerations and analyze 
their transition plans and initiatives 
for mitigating risks associated with 
these factors.
HDFC Bank Limited

Portfolio Risk
The Bank has partnered with an 
independent, reputable global agency 
to develop a framework for assessing 
climate transition risk at a counterparty 
level. Furthermore, the Bank has 
launched an internal pilot exercise 
to estimate financed emissions for 
specific sectors in its lending portfolio.
Climate Risk Measurement 
(Portfolio level)
The development of methodologies 
and tools to link climate risk to 
traditional financial risk parameters, 
economic impact modelling, scenario 
analysis, and stress testing is still 
being progressively explored through 
global collaborations. Addressing 
challenges such as the availability of 
climate-related data (including the 
frequency of climate events at good 
spatial resolution, and regional and 
global sector impacts), regional climate 
impact scenarios, and comprehensive 
climate risk assessment tools and 
methodologies remains crucial. 
The Bank is committed to staying 
ahead of the curve and building 
capacity and understanding of the 
financial and non-financial impact of 
climate change.
The Bank undertakes stress testing 
and scenario analysis to assess 
the potential impact of geopolitical, 
macroeconomic, and sectoral trends 
on its portfolio and subsequently build 
its climate resilience.

At the Bank, stress testing involves 
the use of various techniques to 
assess the potential vulnerability 
to extreme but plausible stressed 
business conditions. The changes in 
the levels of Pillar I Risks and select 
Pillar II Risks, along with the changes 
in the on and off-Balance Sheet 
positions of the Bank are assessed 
under assumed ‘stress’ scenarios and 
sensitivity factors. The suite of stress 
scenarios includes topical themes 
as well as historically observed 
geopolitical/macroeconomic/sectoral 
and other trends.
From the perspective of climate 
risk assessment, we are exploring 
third-party frameworks to assess the 
physical and transition risks in the near 
to medium term.
We intend to integrate our climate 
strategy and the impact of climaterelated issues into our financial 
planning processes, and to that 
effect, are developing processes and 
tools that will influence our business 
activities. We aim to:
• decarbonise our operations
• expand our green and sustainable 
banking products
• enhance the scope and accuracy 
of our climate scenario analysis and 
stress testing, applicable for the 
bank’s lending portfolio.
• monitor and estimate our lending 
portfolio related financed emissions.
As disclosure requirements and 
regulations continue to evolve, we 
expect to take these into consideration 
while developing our financial strategy.
As a Bank, we recognise that we 
do bear some responsibility for the 
environmental impacts of projects 
and entities that we finance. We have 
on a voluntary basis, commenced 
the exercise of measuring financed 
emissions of the bank’s lending 
portfolio. We are working with a 
climate tech startup to help in the 
assessment of measuring financed 
emissions based on our lending to 
various industries/sectors. We are 
testing the efficacy of India specific 
sectoral emission intensities based on 
Environmentally Extended Economic 
Input-Output models. 
On some of our corporate/ wholesale 
loans, it has been our constant 
endeavor to collect E&S information as 
per our ESG Risk Management Policy. 
While we recognise the challenges in 
collecting data on emissions, we are 
encouraged that a growing number of 
our wholesale borrowers are reporting 
Scope 1 and Scope 2 data. 
Financed emissions refer to 
the greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions that are associated 
with lending and investment 
activities of financial 
institutions. As per the GHG 
Protocol, financed emissions 
are a specific category 
of indirect, downstream 
emissions and are classified as 
Scope 3 emissions. Financed 
emissions are critical to better 
understand the role of the 
financial sector in climate 
change. However, the lack 
of reliable and standardised 
India specific emission 
factors remains a challenge in 
measuring financed emissions. 
The Partnership for Carbon 
Accounting Financials (PCAF) 
provides a framework to help 
financial institutions report 
their financed emissions. 
While the PCAF guidance 
varies across different 
asset classes, the broad 
methodology for corporate 
loans revolves around the 
concept of determining the 
financed emissions of a 
given exposure using the 
concept of an ‘attribution 
factor’ and then applying it 
to the estimated emissions 
of the underlying company 
or sub-sector. Further, PCAF 
guidance is available for 
only a few asset classes, 
which poses constraints in 
determining overall portfolio 
level emissions.
The PCAF methodology 
ascribes data quality scores 
from level 1 to 5. Level 1 data 
is where emission factors of 
the underlying entity has been 
verified by an independent 
third party. Level 2 data entails 
emissions that are reported 
by companies but have not 
been externally verified. Level 
3 to 5 data is where emissions 
are calculated based on 
production level activity or 
sectoral /proxy data.
Measurement of Financed Emissions: Pilot Study
HDFC Bank Limited

Based on loans of the previous year, we undertook a pilot study of a sample pool of 2,768 wholesale loans to 309 
listed entities disclosing Level 1 or Level 2 data on Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, across 34 sectors, which included 
certain hard-to-abate industries. Our reporting of financed emissions followed the PCAF standard for corporate loans as 
described below:
Using the above-mentioned PCAF 
methodology, the sample pool totalling 
approximately H1.5 lakh crore had 
financed emissions of 12.2 million t of 
CO2e. Although it is acknowledged 
that the exercise is backward looking, 
rather than futuristic, it still represents 
a significant milestone in the Bank’s 
journey towards measuring and 
managing its financed emissions. 
The exercise has enabled the Bank 
to identify variances based on 
actual entity-level data of Scope 1 
and 2 emissions versus applying 
sectoral level emission factors. This 
understanding shall help the Bank 
to establish more accurate baselines 
which will serve as the foundation 
for setting realistic and achievable 
emission reduction targets. Further, 
the Bank shall also continue to work 
towards widening its coverage for 
financed emissions, whilst also 
ensuring that it plays a role in being 
enablers of transition finance.
Organisational Risk
The Bank’s operations entail 
compliance and reputation risks, as 
well as ESG risks. To address these 
risks, the Bank has established an 
aggregate Risk Appetite Framework. 
Furthermore, risk-specific policies, 
limits and triggers are implemented 
to operationalise the appetites for 
individual risk types. The Bank 
recognises climate risk as a material 
risk. The Bank has a structured 
management framework called the 
Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment 
Process (ICAAP) to identify, assess, 
and manage all risks that could 
potentially have a significant negative 
impact on our business, financial 
position, or capital adequacy.
Metrics and Targets
We have taken on an ambitious 
target for achieving carbon neutrality 
of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 
FY32 and are already aligning our 
operations to progressively stringent 
internal benchmarks for enhancing our 
energy performance and integration 
of renewable energy. (Refer GHG 
emissions section for further details).
Additionally, we aspire to fortify our 
commitment to financing climate 
change solutions such as energy 
transition, renewables, energy 
efficiency, sustainable transportation, 
green buildings, climate smart 
agriculture, among others, and have 
already embarked on a process to 
examine our financed emissions 
and carbon-related asset exposure 
with the intent to develop KPIs and 
track the progress towards assisting 
our customers in transitioning to a 
sustainable, lower-carbon economy.

HDFC Bank has adopted a multipronged approach to provide an 
omnichannel experience to its 
customers. On the one hand, it has 
traditional touchpoints like Branches, 
Email Care and PhoneBanking. 
On the other hand, it has state-ofthe-art platforms like NetBanking, 
MobileBanking, WhatsApp Banking, 
the chatbot Eva and the Bank's 
exclusive social care handles. The 
Bank also has a Virtual Relationship 
Management (VRM) programme to 
cater to various financial needs in a 
personalised manner.
Customer service performance and 
grievance redressal are regularly 
assessed at various levels, including 
Branch Level Customer Service 
Committees, Standing Committee 
on Customer Service and Customer 
Service Committee of the Board. 
HDFC Bank has implemented 
robust methods to monitor and 
measure service quality levels across 
touchpoints including at product and 
process level, through the efforts of 
the Quality Initiatives Group.
The Service Quality team conducts 
regular reviews across various 
products, processes, and channels 
focusing on improving the customer 
experience. A unique Service Quality 
Index (SQI) has been developed to 
measure the performance of key 
customer facing channels based on 
critical customer service parameters. 
This SQI enables continuous 
improvement of initiatives to raise 
service standards.
One of the basic building blocks 
of providing acceptable level of 
customer service is to have an 
effective internal Grievance Redressal 
Mechanism/Framework. HDFC Bank 
has developed a comprehensive 
Grievance Redressal Policy, 
Customer Rights Policy, Customer 
Compensation Policy duly approved 
by the Board which outlines a 
framework for resolving customer 
grievances. These policies are 
accessible to customers through the 
Bank’s website and branch network.
HDFC Bank has created multiple 
channels for customers to provide 
feedback and register grievances 
facilitating a transparent and 
accessible system. As a pioneer in 
innovative financial solutions and 
digital platforms, it has witnessed 
an increased utilisation of its digital 
channels. Keeping customer interest 
in focus, the Bank has formulated a 
Board approved Protection Policy 
which limits the liability of customers 
in case of unauthorised electronic 
banking transactions.
This Bank is compliant with the RBI 
Internal Ombudsman Guidelines. At 
the apex level, as a part of the Internal 
Grievance Redressal Mechanism, the 
Bank has appointed seasoned-retired 
bankers as Internal Ombudsmen to 
independently review any customer 
grievance which is partly/wholly 
rejected by the bank before the 
final decision is communicated to 
the customer.
HDFC Bank is on a journey to 
measure customer loyalty through a 
high velocity, closed loop customer 
feedback system. This customer 
experience transformation programme 
helps employees to empathise 
better with customers and improve 
turnaround times. Branded as 
‘Infinite Smiles,’ the programme helps 
establish behaviours and practices 
that result in customer-centric actions 
through continuous improvement 
in products, services, process 
and policies.
The Bank remains committed to 
placing the customer at the centre 
of its operations. By consistently 
improving customer experience, 
adopting an omnichannel approach 
and implementing robust service 
quality and Grievance Redressal 
Mechanisms, it aims to build 
lasting relationships.
Building a CustomerCentric Culture using Net 
Promoter System (NPS) - 
‘Infinite Smiles’
We, at the Bank, believe that 
delivering an outstanding customer 
experience is a strong differentiator 
for a great product and is key to a 
sustained competitive advantage. 
The primary aim of the Infinite Smiles 
programme is to establish employee 
behaviour and practices which lead 
to customer- centric actions and 
continuous improvements.

C U S T O M E R C E N T R I C I T Y
In March 2020, we initiated 
measurement on key journeys, 
identified action areas to improve 
customer experience and implemented 
several key initiatives. This has led to 
a steady improvement on our NPS 
over the years. This year, we built on 
our commitment to our customers 
by scaling the coverage of our Infinite 
Smiles programme – we introduced 
new journeys, new episodes and 
new products ensuring a much wider 
coverage. Customer focus has seen 
increased focus - regular cadence 
with key stakeholders and rigorous 
follow-up on actions have become the 
cornerstones of Infinite Smiles.
The programme now encompasses 
critical episodes – On-Boarding 
journeys, customer instructions, CQR. 
We now cover 140+ episodes and 
have contacted around 100 million+ 
customers in Financial Year 2023-24 for 
their feedback.
Our ‘Infinite Smiles’ program rests on 
three meticulously designed pillars 
– ‘Listen’; ‘Learn’; and ‘Act’ which 
enables us to embed customerfeedback led transformation as a 
discipline into our systems, challenge 
what is considered as the standard, 
and offer a customer experience 
that places us amongst the best 
service brands.
This well-defined System builds on 
the Score and requires every level 
of the organisation to be rigorously, 
consistently focused on the quality of 
customer and employee relationships. 
In order to foster individual learning and 
inspire front-line employees to do right 
by customers, we created an advocacy 
organisation that ensures
Sustained Leadership 
Commitment
 
Embraced the goal of creating 
more promoters and fewer 
detractors as a mission to building 
Service First Culture.
2. Building Greater Focus on

Operationalising customer 
empathy, through Detractor

UPI Secondary ASBA
Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) 
or Digital Rupee as it is popularly 
known, is the digital, secure, faster, 
and more inclusive version of the 
paper-note Indian Rupee. It ensures 
privacy as personal information of 
payer is not exposed on making 
payments. CBDC fosters financial 
inclusion, reduces operational 
costs associated with physical cash 
management, improves efficiency 
and enhances innovation in 
payment systems.
With programmability and offline 
feature being introduced in near 
future, it can be a game changer in 
the payments industry. Currently, 
HDFC Bank has over 5 lakh 
customers registered on the app 
transacting K169 crore annually.
UPI Autopay is a feature that 
allows users to set up a mandate 
for recurring payments. The use 
cases include bill payments, school 
fees, OTT subscriptions, insurance 
premiums, EMI repayments, 
Mutual Funds etc. for which regular 
collection by the merchant is 
required. It is a simple, timely and 
reliable payment system for users. 
It helps in avoiding late fee charges, 
disconnections thereby playing a 
pivotal role in customer retention and 
benefitting merchants.
HDFC Bank has acquired top 
merchants across industries 
collecting K2,100 crore as 
monthly recurring payment 
through this feature.
UPI Secondary ASBA also called 
Single Block Multiple Debit is a 
payment mechanism that allows 
investors to block their funds within 
their bank accounts towards a definite 
purchase of a financial instrument.
The amount debit gets initiated by the 
clearing corporations (both NCL & 
ICCL) only for successful settlement.
This blocking mechanism is driven on 
UPI railroad and allows users to have 
secure and convenient transactions. 
We are one of the first Banks to 
extend UPI Secondary ASBA feature.

ensuring the successful 
launch of over 900 
branches in FY24. 
Meticulous planning 
and seamless execution 
ensured that each site was 
equipped with necessary 
infrastructure and systems.
Internet breakout has 
been implemented in 
over 900 branches 
to improve access to 
internet applications using 
SDWAN and Zscaler 
Internet Access.
We leveraged a Secure 
Access Service Edge 
partner’s advanced 
zero trust technology 
to seamlessly navigate 
through the merger, 
ensuring network harmony 
and eliminating conflicts.
Our collaboration 
has enabled us to 
reduce dependency 
on Multiprotocol Label 
Switching across 
branches, enhancing 
operational efficiency 
and agility.
Furthermore, with the 
successful implementation 
of a cloud native security 
service edge solution, we 
have not only strengthened 
our security measures but 
also boosted performance.
Advancing our Tech and 
Digital Transformation 
journey, we emphasise 
seamless digital 
experiences across 
touchpoints. Our Factory 
approach fosters 
co-creation of Tech 
IP, guided by Agile, 
DevSecOps principles 
and cloudification.
Our API Factory builds 
scalable, reusable 
architectures for 
swift integrations 
with third parties and 
Fintechs propelling 
us into embedded 
banking for richer 
customer experiences.
Aggregating systems, 
co-creating with partners, 
and prioritising scalability 
and observability enhance 
customer experience and 
elevate success rates for 
payment transactions.
We sustained an uptime 
of 99.96% for our 
customers in FY24.
The improvement over 
the 99.95% uptime 
in the previous year 
is a testament to our 
commitment to enhance 
the overall reliability of the 
banking experience.

Safeguarding Data
The Bank is deeply committed to 
ensuring robust cyber security as 
part of its technology transformation 
journey. Significant strides have been 
made to strengthen its infrastructure 
and applications. 
Key Initiatives
• Your Bank has made significant 
strides in consolidating cyber 
security including establishing a 
next-generation Cyber Security 
Operations Centre (CSOC) for 
predictive security and incident 
management. Introduction of 
Security Orchestration, Automation 
and Response (SOAR) reduces 
incident response time while 
network micro-segmentation 
enhances control and visibility 
against ransomware threats
• Next-gen Security Incident Event 
Management (SIEM) solution, 
empowered by Al/ML capabilities, 
alongside robust User Entity 
and Behavior Analysis (UEBA) 
functionalities and built-in threat 
modelling, leads the industry 
in proactive threat detection 
and response
• Continuous 24/7 defacement 
monitoring, vulnerability 
management, antivirus/malware 
programs, patch management and 
penetration testing fortify the Bank's 
assets minimising the surface area 
for cyberattacks
• A dedicated Attack Surface 
Management (ASM) Program 
ensures ongoing discovery and 
remediation of weaknesses on 
discovered assets
• Anti-DDoS services subscription 
provides protection against 
Distributed Denial of Service 
attacks, while anti-Advanced 
Persistence Threat (Anti-APT) 
system agents safeguard 
all endpoints from zero-day 
malware attacks
• Embracing a zero-trust architecture 
approach, HDFC Bank implements 
enterprise solutions like Data 
Loss Prevention (DLP) to monitor 
sensitive data and prevent data 
breaches along with proxy agents 
on endpoints for authorised 
website access and DLP-monitored 
outgoing emails
• Laptop Encryption: Data 
encryption ensures that businesscritical and sensitive data is not 
misplaced, thereby preventing 
any reputational damage and 
curtailing monetary losses. Hard 
disk encryption is implemented on 
all laptops
• Implementation of Domain-based 
Message Authentication, Reporting 
and Conformance (DMARC) system 
for protecting the Bank's domain 
from unauthorised use, commonly 
known as email spoofing
Overall, the Bank's cyber security 
measures are focused on ensuring 
the highest level of protection 
against cyber threats with proactive 
monitoring and automated incident 
response capabilities, enhanced 
network visibility and a zero-trust 
approach to security.

Each pillar represents elements that the Bank stands for and believes in. 
Reinforcement of the HDFC Bank Way continues to be a key focus area of 
the Bank.
Culture Transformation
Rooted in the HDFC Bank Way, 
our Culture Framework serves as 
a guiding light shaping our path 
towards becoming a future-ready 
organisation. It is not merely a set of 
guidelines but a living embodiment 
of our values, beliefs and aspirations. 
Our culture fosters an environment

HDFC Bank
July 01, 2023 marked a historical 
moment for the Bank as we 
welcomed over 4,000 employees 
through the merger with erstwhile 
HDFC Limited. This was the coming 
together of two iconic brands 
that are known for excellence in 
their respective sectors. Hereon, 
it will be our joint responsibility to 
take the Bank to its next level with 
enhanced customer experience and 
an engaged employee ecosystem. 
On the people front, extensive 
efforts were made to assimilate our 
colleagues into the HDFC Bank 
culture and ethos.
An all employee Virtual Townhall 
was conducted by the Managing 
Director, Deputy Managing Director 
and Executive Director to warmly 
welcome our erstwhile HDFC 
Limited (eHL) colleagues into the 
Bank. Multiple Meet and Greet 
sessions were organised with the 
Bank Leaders and Senior Level 
Supervisors. The HR Business 
Partnering teams conducted 
multiple Orientation Sessions and 
Roadshows for eHL employees 
across locations. The focus was on 
sensitisation around Bank policies, 
processes, systems, culture and 
the way of working. A Grievance 
Committee was also set up for 
real-time support for addressing 
employee concerns and queries. 
The efforts have gone a long way 
in enabling people integration 
and assimilation, relationship 
building and over the year our eHL 
colleagues have got accustomed to 
the HDFC Bank Way of life.

Cultural transformation is an enduring 
journey marked by numerous small 
and big milestones propelling it 
forward. However, the critical success 
factor in this is Leadership Conviction, 
Sustained Commitment and Collective 
Action. We began this journey in the 
year 2021 and several initiatives over 
the last three years have been taken 
to sustain the momentum of change. 
20,000 plus people managers of 
the Bank who are the real Culture 
Champions were trained on the 
supervisory behaviour framework 
– Nurture, Care, Collaborate (NCC), 
to further strengthen on ground 
supervisory behaviours in line with our 
espoused Cultural ethos. Extensive 
investments on enabling, equipping 
and measuring managerial impact on 
culture have been made over the last 
three years. 
One such investment was the launch 
of NCC Leadership Dialogues.
Through this initiative, senior leaders 
from across the country engaged 
with employees sharing personal 
stories and anecdotes from their life 
journey that amplify our core values. 
These dialogues not only served as 
inspiration but also provided valuable 
insights into overcoming challenges, 
embracing resilience and staying 
hopeful. 
Additionally, we introduced 
an engaging and educational 
communication campaign, Living 
the HDFC Bank Way. This Bank 
wide campaign offers practical 
scenarios to illustrate acceptable 
and unacceptable behaviours. 
By equipping our workforce with 
knowledge and guidance they 
need, we are empowering them 
to lead the transformation in their 
area of influence. Culture is the 
collective behaviour of our 2 lakh 
plus employees and it has been 
our endeavour to inspire them at 
an individual level to participate in 
this journey.

NCC Short Films
NCC Micro-experiences
Evolve
NCC short films were 
conceptualised, scripted 
and enacted by HDFC 
Bank employees. The 
films picturise the negative 
impact of bad behaviour 
on team morale and how 
managers can correct 
the situation. The films 
encourage our viewers to 
adopt NCC principles as a 
way of life.
NCC micro-experiences 
is a communication series 
to guide employees 
especially managers in 
creating instant, realistic 
and meaningful micro 
experiences for their 
teams. The idea is to create 
a positive environment 
which will strengthen 
emotional bonds among 
team members and build 
stronger, cohesive teams. 
These micro experiences 
focus on the 9 practices 
of NCC and are shared 
with all employees on a 
regular basis.
Evolve aims at building 
capability of our people 
managers’ to effectively 
demonstrate managerial 
behaviours including holding 
performance conversations, 
using appreciative inquiry, 
bridging the generational 
gap at work and improving 
connect with new joiners in 
their teams.
30 second reels were 
created to explicitly 
articulate managers’ or 
colleagues' unacceptable 
behaviours @HDFC Bank. 
The reels reiterate the 
message that HDFC Bank is 
psychologically a safe place 
to work, where employees 
should feel valued, trusted 
be authentic.
Some of the interventions shared below are examples of various communication themes that were used during the year. 
We successfully launched Biannual Culture Pulse Survey in 2023 
to assess the on-ground sentiment 
of employees. The survey broadly 
measured Culture parameters 
- Humility, Integrity, Inclusion, 
Nurture, Care, Collaborate. Over 
one lakh employees responded to 
the survey.
Vibes is a team-sentiment 
survey tool designed to measure 
employee experience with 
their managers in the Bank. 
Over 15,000 people managers 
received feedback from 1.16 
lakh employees.
Listening Architecture
Our Listening Architecture 
uses phygital platforms to 
conduct regular surveys 
and dipsticks gathering 
feedback to understand 
employee sentiment. 
This allows us to create 
tailored actions to improve 
employee morale and 
reinforce our culture.

Accelerated Journey 
on Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion
The Bank had a stated objective of 
reaching 25 per cent gender diversity 
by FY25 . Our active leadership, 
sponsorship and relentless effort 
on the ground has accelerated 
our journey towards crossing this 
milestone a year ahead of the targeted 
date. At the end of FY24, our gender 
ratio was 26.04 per cent, up from 18 
per cent in FY21, marking a change 
of almost 8 per cent in three years. 
This represents a more than 2.5 times 
increase in the number of women, 
from 21,746 in FY21 to 55,610 in FY24. 
We now aim to achieve 27 per cent 
gender diversity by FY27.

‘Great Place to Work 
Recertification’
The Bank has been certified as 
a ‘Great Place to Work’ for 3rd 
consecutive time and we continue 
to focus on building our employer 
brand around the tenets of Pride, Care 
and Inclusion.
HDFC Bank has been consistently 
recognised as a Great Place to 
Work® organisation for three 
consecutive cycles, highlighting 
A. Intensifying Diversity Hiring
Diversity hiring was a key focus 
area for the Bank and this was 
seamlessly woven into our overall 
talent acquisition strategy. Throughout 
the year, we spearheaded targeted 
initiatives such as women hiring 
drives and specialised programs 
to reintegrate returning women 
professionals after career breaks. 
Our partnerships with all-women 
colleges and diversity partners further 
underscore our dedication to fostering 
an inclusive workforce. Innovation 
continues to drive efficiency and 
effectiveness in our talent acquisition 
function. With the introduction of AI 
powered hiring the attempt is to make 
our hiring process fair and unbiased. 
This has especially helped in our 
diversity hiring agenda.
We take pride in several ‘All Women 
Branches’ doing exceptionally well 
on customer service, compliance, 
performance and all other major 
parameters. This serves as a 
testimony to the fact that inclusive 
organisations perform better in the 
long run. Many of these branches 
are situated in deep geographies 
where they also serve as a lever for 
social change.
Building an inclusive organisation 
requires continuous effort of 
recognising and addressing 
unconscious biases and building 
support structures. Over the past year, 
we have focused on identifying highpotential women in junior and middle 
management and actively guiding their 
career paths. This includes helping 
them take on higher-impact roles, 
equipping them with the necessary 
skills and competencies and providing 
visibility of opportunities.

B. Women Retention and Engagement
The Bank has developed various initiatives and supportive policy measures which would enable us to ensure higher women 
engagement, offer them career growth opportunities, thereby retain women and build the leadership pipeline. Some of our 
key initiatives include:
The ‘Broken Rung’ is a global 
phenomenon where diversity ratios 
across mid and senior levels in 
organisations drop significantly. This 
is because life-stage milestones often 
coincide with career milestones for 
women. In recognition of this, the 
Bank had introduced the ‘Pleasant 
Parenthood Program’ which is 
a slew of benefits for primary 
caregivers. This includes flexibility 
options, rating protection, wellness 
support and manager guidance. 
These policy measures are now 
becoming a ‘Way of life’ in the Bank. 
The 'Career Accelerator Program' 
is our flagship initiative designed for 
mid-senior level women in the 
Bank. Given its success, we continue 
to run this program to maintain a 
robust talent pipeline of women 
advancing into senior leadership 
roles. Over 200 high-potential 
women leaders have been part of 
the CAP journey across two cycles. 
Sponsored by the DEI Council, the 
program focuses on authenticity and 
self-awareness, building a leadership 
brand, executive presence, influencing 
and networking.
‘Stay interviews’ with select women 
employees across levels have helped 
us pre-empt support requirements 
and customise solutions at an 
individual employee level.

21st June - 
Inclusion Day for the Bank
This year, we marked our progress 
in the DEI journey by announcing 
the Bank’s Diversity, Equity, and 
Inclusion policy on Inclusion Day. 
The campaigns revolved around 
the theme "Respect for All" 
highlighting humility and respect as 
central pillars of our inclusive culture. 
Employees nationwide shared their 
personal stories on the meaning of 
'Respect' for them. On June 21st, our 
events featured notable speakers, 
including Mr. Sanjiv Mehta, Mrs. Zia 
Mody, Mr. Patanjali Keswani and 
Ms. Dia Mirza.

All the above actions have resulted 
in higher retention rates for women 
and significant improvement in their 
engagement scores. The number 
of women employees who reported 
a positive workplace experience 
has significantly increased over the 
years. The gap between employee 
experience of men and women has 
also steadily declined. This evolution 
underscores the Bank's commitment 
to nurturing an inclusive and 
diverse workplace.

Focus on Arresting Attrition
Post the pandemic, the BFSI sector had experienced a significant surge in employee attrition. It is also among the largest 
employers of a young workforce. Research indicates a notable shift in the younger generation's response to 'what you want 
from life’. This heightens our challenges in retaining young talent, especially on the frontline. However, in FY24 the Bank took 
up the challenge to arrest the trend and reverse it which involved a multi-pronged approach led by a Task Force at the highest 
level. The Task Force has recommended several actions which have been taken up for implementation.

Talent Acquisition
FY24 was, characterised by 
significant investments in building 
Talent Acquisition capability. Our 
efforts were centred on improving 
efficiency, ensuring diversity, 
enhancing multi-channel sourcing 
capabilities, optimising costs per 
hire and integrating advanced AIbased technologies.
With a keen focus on sustainability 
and innovation, we have invested in 
building a fresh talent pipeline through 
strategic partnerships and job-ready 
models. For example, participation in 
the Future Banker 2.0 program has 
surged impressively compared to the 
previous fiscal year.
Gender diversity remains a 
cornerstone of our organisational 
ethos, seamlessly integrated into our 
talent acquisition strategy. Throughout 
the year, we ran targeted initiatives 
such as women hiring drives and 
the "Bank Again" program, which 
invited women ex-bankers to rejoin 
the workforce after a career break. 
We also have partnerships with 
several colleges especially in deep 
geographies. We maintained a gender 
ratio in hiring of 33 per cent in FY24.

Talent Management
The Bank further strengthened the 
Talent Management framework by 
leveraging a technology platform 
which enables access, use and 
recording of information in real 
time mode. We conducted talent 
reviews across various job bands 
primarily using digital platforms. This 
has aided our endeavour to build 
a strong pipeline of talent across 
various leadership and critical roles in 
the organisation.
On Talent Management, the Bank 
follows a process of assessing 
potential through tools like 
Development Centres at various levels, 
then reviewing Talent through Talent 
Review Councils on a performance 
potential matrix and then putting 
in place a development plan at an 
individual employee level for the 
identified talent. This year an additional 
psychometric profiling tool has been 
introduced for better understanding 
of employee profiles and assist in the 
career planning process.
The Bank continued to strengthen 
its succession planning process at 
senior levels in order to ensure the 
mitigation of Business Continuity Risk. 
Succession planning process focuses 
on providing employees with relevant 
role exposures, specific mentoring as 
well as coaching opportunities and 
addressing their identified learning 
needs. By doing so, the Bank ensures 
that employees are prepared to take 
up higher responsibilities when the 
opportunity arises.
HR Technology
In FY24, we continued to focus 
on investing in technology in the 
HR domain to ensure a seamless 
employee experience given the 
distributed nature of our workforce. 
This has helped create value for 
employees and the organisation as a 
whole. Deployment of critical talent 
processes across the employee life 
cycle across our large and scattered 
workforce has been enabled through 
technology solutions.

Learning and Development
The Learning and Development team 
at the Bank fosters a continuous 
learning ecosystem through rich and 
diverse offerings enabling employees 
to deliver a world-class customer 
experience aligned with the Bank’s 
strategic priorities. This encompasses 
customised onboarding, functional 
capability building, compliance 
and regulatory training, leadership 
development initiatives and digital 
learning. Our key drivers are 
learning outcomes aligned with 
leadership excellence, operational 
efficiencies, customer experience and 
business performance.
Our biggest highlight in the learning 
space this year has been the launch 
of MPower, our learning experience 
platform in July 2023. In this initiative, 
we have partnered with global leaders 
in learning technology. The platform 
features the Bank’s proprietary 
content alongside a diverse range 
of material from top-tier content 
providers worldwide. The success of 
a newly launched technology platform 
is measured by its adoption. We are 
pleased to report that within the first 
30 days 86 per cent of our employees 
had adopted the platform, and by 
year-end, this figure rose to 98 
per cent. This is the highest adoption 
rate in the industry for an organisation 
of our size.
L&D collaborated with business 
teams to roll-out a range of 
learning interventions including 
product and process training, 
FAQs, toolkits, amongst others to 
enable a quick assimilation of the 
incoming employees.
All Sales and Associate Workforce 
joining the Bank undergo a structured 
onboarding programme called 
‘Swagat’. It is followed by mandatory/
regulatory modules on our learning 
platform. In collaboration with 
respective business teams, we also 
offered curated programmes on 
products, policies and procedures 
to strengthen their domain expertise. 
Additionally, theme based monthly 
learning campaigns were delivered in 
vernacular languages across various 
professional development areas.

Our Board-level CSR & ESG

in pursuance of its CSR policy. 
The Bank's CSR policy serves as 
a guiding document containing 
the approach and direction given 
by the Board, taking into account 
the recommendations of the CSR 
Committee, defining guiding principles 
for selection, implementation and 
monitoring of activities as well as 
formulation of the annual action plan.

intervention areas aligned to the 
strategy. Under each program detailed 
project proposals are developed 
outlining implementation modalities, 
monitoring mechanisms and budgets. 
Projects are executed either directly 
through the Bank or indirectly via 
implementing agencies. A thorough 
due diligence and assessment is 
conducted to ensure the viability of the 
project and the proposed partners’ 
technical and managerial capabilities 
to execute. Under this execution 
modality, empanelled agencies 
submit project proposals containing 
information on goals and objectives, 
target community, monitoring plan, 
indicators and budget. The proposals 
are evaluated for alignment with the 
communities needs, the Bank’s CSR 
vision, potential impact, sustainability, 
scalability and efficient utilisation 
of resources.
Once implementation starts, the 
project’s progress and impact are 
monitored through regular site visits, 
stakeholder engagement, dialogue 
with government officials, review of

This year we conducted 
Impact assessments for our 
CSR projects with a budget of 
J1 crore or more.
The impact assessments 
considered the OECD-DAC 
criteria, which is widely 
regarded as one of the gold 
standards in evaluation 
frameworks. This framework 
assesses the project’s 
indicators by determining 
their Relevance, Coherence, 
Effectiveness, Efficiency, 
Impact and Sustainability. 
These criteria provide a 
normative framework used to 
determine the merit or worth 
of an intervention (policy, 
strategy, programme, project 
or activity). Other frameworks 
like the standard OutcomeImpact Framework was 
also followed to analyse and 
measure the outcomes and 
impact of the selected project 
by tracing the changes since 
the implementation of the 
project and establishing the 
causes of these changes.
In FY24, we conducted 
an impact assessment of 
61 projects. Based on the 
assessment findings, several 
recommendations were 
proposed for the evaluated

Rural Development 
As a cornerstone of our commitment 
to empowering marginalised 
communities, improving infrastructure 
and enhancing livelihood 
opportunities; we prioritise rural 
areas for the implementation of our 
programs. Currently, a considerable 
number of our initiatives are 
being implemented in such areas. 
Furthermore, we have ensured the 
coverage of 85 aspirational districts 
(out of the total of 112) through our 
CSR programs.
The World Bank defines rural 
development as the improvement 
in the social and economic 
environment of the rural population. 
The fundamental aims of rural 
development include planning, 
creating and using resources such as 
land, water and manpower to promote 
equal opportunity for the population 
reliant on them. 
Given this context, Holistic Rural 
Development Programme (HRDP) 
strives to enhance the lives of people 
in rural communities by primarily 
bringing about sustainable socioeconomic transformation and 
ecological development. HRDP 
adopts a comprehensive approach 
to sustainable development by 
integrating various interventions, 
ranging from Natural Resource 
Management, Education and 
Livelihood Enhancement & Skill 
Development to Healthcare. Targeted 
interventions for rural livelihood 
enhancement are also undertaken as 
a part of HRDP, including providing 
income-generating training for youth 
and women, creating alternate 
sources of livelihood such as livestock 
management, orchard development 
and promoting entrepreneurship 
activities like embroidery, masala 
making and toy manufacturing, 
among others. 
This program focuses on a diverse 
array of activities including but not 
limited to enhancing the income 
of farmers, access to appropriate 
irrigation facilities, improving school 
infrastructure, providing access 
to potable water and irrigation, 
and promoting alternative energy 
sources such as solar, biogas and 
biomass energy. Additionally, HRDP 
encompasses the organisation of 
health camps, demonstration of 
sustainable agricultural practices, 
initiatives for soil and water 
conservation and financial literacy. 
Furthermore, our Focused 
Development Program (FDP), which 
is aimed at specific interventions and 
limited goals, assist us in achieving our 
objectives in a concentrated manner. 
Under Rural Development, we have 
identified three key targets that we 
aim to achieve through our HRDP and 
FDP projects.

Reducing our carbon footprint
Our aim is to support 25 per cent 
of households in each village with 
solar home lights, biomass chulha, 
biogas plants, solar study lamps and 
irrigation units.
This intervention includes promoting 
biomass stoves as it improves indoor 
air quality and women's health.
We have surpassed our tree planting 
target, reaching 38 lakh, exceeding 
the initial goal of 25 lakh trees 
by FY25.
Promoting chemical-free 
farming
Our aim is to educate farmers on 
various agricultural techniques 
that improve productivity while 
using locally produced manure and 
fertilisers, to reduce the reliance on 
chemical fertilisers.
This intervention is designed to allow 
us to maintain the soil, environment 
and human health by combining 
tradition, creativity and science.
Bringing unirrigated 
land under irrigation and 
uncultivated land under 
cultivation
Our aim is to increase the area 
under cultivation and enhance 
the cropping intensity of the 
land, thereby bolstering the 
agricultural sector.
We are working diligently to increase 
the cultivable land pan India.
OUR TARGETS
Bringing land under 
cultivation
• Irrigate 2 lakh acres of unirrigated 
land by the year 2025
• Bringing 1 lakh acres of land 
under cultivation by the year 2025
Reducing the carbon and the 
ecological footprint of our 
communities
• 1,000 villages to have clean and 
renewable energy solutions
Promoting chemical-free

By focusing on improving land 
and crop productivity, providing 
agricultural training, enhancing 
health and sanitation infrastructure, 
and upgrading educational facilities, 
HRDP aims to build local capacities, 
strengthen institutions and 
introduce technological inputs. This 
comprehensive approach ensures 
sustainable development, better 
income opportunities, improved 
health outcomes and enhanced 
educational experiences for rural 
populations. The intervention under 
HRDP was implemented by our 
partner Aga Khan Rural Support 
Programme (India) and undertaken 
from April 2019 to March 2022. The 
intervention covered 12 villages 
across the Nandod block wherein 
the villages were selected for 
implementation because of their 
remote location near the border 
thereby making it difficult for any 
support to reach.

The intervention led to an increase 
in the average net income from

skill development and average 
income from livestock.
Based on the design of the 
HRDP program supported 
by HDFC Bank, a composite 
index has been developed 
called the Holistic Rural 
Development Index 
(HRDI) that indicates the 
achievements of the HRDP 
interventions leading to 
overall improvements of 
the results indicators. As 
the program interventions 
vary across projects 
and geographies, it is 
not possible to ascribe 
a single impact indicator 
that might be able to 
accurately capture the 
overall performance of 
HRDP. Thus, HRDI serves 
the purpose of quantifying 
the impact through the 
blending of results of 
various indicators grouped 
into four thematic areas 
namely Natural Resource 
Management, Skill Training 
& Livelihood Enhancement, 
Health & Sanitation and 
Promotion of Education.

Uttarakhand, and Khorda 
District in Odisha, our climate 
projects stand united by 
a common commitment: 
to confront environmental 
challenges with sustainable 
solutions, ensuring the 
resilience and prosperity of 
rural communities.
In Biswanath, where diminishing 
rainfall and receding groundwater 
levels exacerbate water scarcity 
and deforestation, our initiative 
focuses on establishing sustainable 
water sources and promoting 
alternative energy sources like 
biogas units and improved

meetings and the construction 
of Jal Minars for water storage, 
we engage communities in 
the transformative process 
empowering them with the tools to 
combat environmental degradation 
while enhancing their quality of 
life. In Nainital, Uttarakhand, facing 
threats from declining glacial 
meltwater and erratic rainfall 
patterns, our interventions prioritise 
clean water provision, rainwater 
harvesting and the distribution of 
eco-friendly cooking solutions. 
Through meticulous needs 
assessments and transparent 
end-user selection processes, we 
ensure equitable distribution of 
resources, empowering households 
with access to clean water and 
sustainable energy sources. 
Meanwhile, in Khorda, Odisha, 
where uneven rainfall distribution 
compounds water scarcity issues, 
our project endeavours to provide 
clean water access through 
innovative water management 
techniques and promote climatesmart agricultural practices like 
orchard development.

Promotion of Education
We are dedicated to enhancing the 
quality of education in India, aligning 
our efforts with the Government's 
Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan. Under our 
Parivartan initiative, our education 
programs focus on various 
aspects including teacher training, 
scholarships, career guidance 
and infrastructural support for 
schools. This support encompasses 
promoting innovation in education, 
improving education quality through 
remedial classes, learning camps 
and providing special scholarships 
for underprivileged children. Our 
educational initiatives are designed 
to foster learning by establishing 
a conducive and efficient learning

Skill Development & Livelihood 
Enhancement
This initiative encompasses capacity building, 
promotion of financial literacy, credit and 
entrepreneurial endeavours, along with 
enhancing skills for agricultural and related 
practices. Under the overarching theme of 
capacity development and creation of livelihoods, 
we have established separate goals for individual 
and institutional enhancement.

Increase in Individual Income
Our aim is to enhance income with 
a focus on underprivileged farmers, 
youth, and women nationwide. We 
have devised three distinct subgoals to approach this in a targeted 
and methodical manner.
Increasing the income of small 
and marginal farmers
We encourage farmers to diversify 
their income by supporting them 
in allied activities such as livestock 
rearing, horticulture, timber and 
fishery, amongst others.
To achieve this, we are equipping 
farmers with contemporary and 
innovative farming tools and 
techniques by organising visits 
to various agricultural institutes 
and fields and providing them 
with seeds, fertilisers and other 
necessary support materials.
Promoting 25,000 Communityled Enterprises
We encourage economically 
deprived communities to engage in 
entrepreneurship on an individual or 
cluster basis.
Development and Sustenance 
of Institutions
Our aim is the development and 
sustenance of institutions for 
livelihood enhancement, primarily 
community institutions such as 
village development committees, 
farmers’ groups, SHGs, water user 
groups, sanitation committees and 
adolescent groups. 
Under this intervention, the 
activities we engage in are related 
to agriculture, water, sanitation, 
health, livelihood and other rural 
development work.
Our interventions consist of 
establishing and operating enterprises, 
which include beauty parlours, 
small shops, livestock management, 
tailoring and more - for individual 
beneficiaries, as well as processing 
units, packaging units, fisheries and 
handicrafts - for group enterprises 
established through Farmer Producer 
Organisations (FPO), Self Help Groups 
(SHG) and Joint Liability Group (JLG).
Skill Development for Employment 
Generation
Our focus is on skill development 
for employment generation and we 
are providing classroom/online/
blended skill development training to 
unemployed youth, school dropouts 
and landless farmers.
Our interventions include training 
programs which come with 
certifications from National Skill 
Development Corporation (NSDC), 
Sector Skill Council or other qualified 
non-government agencies and 
are aimed at trades that could 
lead to job placement or selfemployment opportunities.
Increase in Individual Income
• Increase in income of ~5 lakh farmers with an annual income under 
H60,000 across the country by the year 2025
• 2 Lakh individuals to be trained/skills upgraded
• Development and sustenance 
of 20,000 institutions by the 
year 2025
• Local economic activation with 
25,000 community-led enterprises 
promoted with approximately 50% 
being women-led

Healthcare and Hygiene
Our approach to healthcare and 
hygiene is comprehensive and 
multi-faceted. We provide essential 
healthcare services through initiatives 
like refurbishing health clinics, 
supplying medical equipment, 
conducting nutrition programs 
and health awareness drives. 
Simultaneously, we actively promote 
hygiene and sanitation practices in 
schools and local communities to 
create a conducive environment for 
good health and well-being.
Additionally, Waste Management 
remains one of our major intervention 
areas. We have been diligently 
working towards the goals of the 
Swachh Bharat initiative, with a 
particular emphasis on sanitation 
projects. These projects not only 
develop necessary infrastructure 
but also strive to foster behavioural 
change towards better hygiene 
and cleanliness practices among 
individuals and communities.
We are focusing on establishing 
dry waste management systems, 
particularly targeting Multi-Layered 
Plastics (MLPs), in collaboration 
with municipal corporations and 
block-level administrations. These 
efforts aim to enhance the socioeconomic conditions of waste pickers 
in alignment with the Plastic Waste 
Management Rules, 2018 and Swachh 
Bharat Mission. 
Furthermore, we are institutionalising 
waste pickers in Swachh Centres 
(SCs)/MRFs and ULBs for longterm solutions, thereby contributing 
to sustainable waste management 
practices. Through our initiatives, 
we are also generating awareness 
and mobilising communities for safe 
plastic disposal, emphasising the 
importance of responsible waste 
management for environmental and 
public health benefits.
Under this thematic area of Healthcare 
and Hygiene, our objective is to 
enhance the standard of sanitation 
facilities. Our efforts towards achieving 
this objective are directed towards 
three distinct sub-goals, namely 
waste management, access to 
clean drinking water and creating 
hygiene awareness.

Access to Clean Drinking Water
We aim to promote clean drinking water availability at 
both the community level through Jal-minar or other 
water buildings, and at the family level, through piped 
water connections.
Our interventions will result in making three litres of water 
available per person per day. We are also forming and 
orienting water user groups to ensure that the services 
are sustainable, with post-project maintenance and water 
quality testing entrusted to these groups.
Waste Management
We aim to provide the necessary infrastructure, instilling 
behavioural changes towards responsible consumption, 
source segregation and litter prevention. 
Our interventions include setting up material recovery and 
recycling facilities in the 15 ULBs, as well as implementing 
village-level interventions such as residential composting, 
door-to-door garbage collection and related mechanisms 
for user fee collection, compost sales and recycling.
OUR TARGETS
Improve sanitation facilities
• Implement solid waste management systems in 1,000 villages and establish Material 
Recovery Facilities (MRFs) in 15 ULBs
• Provide clean drinking water access to 1,000 villages

Transforming Communities: Innovative Plastic Management Initiatives
In Golaghat District of Assam, our 
collaboration with Gramin Vikas 
Trust resulted in the establishment 
of a state of the art Plastic Waste 
Management Unit. This initiative, 
equipped with innovative features 
like wastewater utilisation for fisheries 
has not only tackled immediate 
waste management needs but also 
laid the foundation for a sustainable 
future through collaborative efforts 
with local administrations and 
educational institutions.
Expanding our footprint across 
states like Assam, Bihar and 
Telangana, we partnered with 
organisations like the Centre for 
Environment Education (CEE) to 
implement comprehensive dry 
waste management projects. These 
initiatives, ranging from establishing 
Swachh Centres to enhancing 
the socio-economic conditions 
of waste pickers highlight the 
scale of our impact in mitigating 
environmental degradation.
Additionally, in locations like

Ensuring Access to Clean Drinking Water Access to Clean Drinking Water
This FDP project, in alignment 
with the Central Government's 
flagship initiative, Jal Jeevan 
Mission (JJM) - ‘Har Ghar Nal 
se Jal’, focused on ‘improving 
access to safe water among 
target communities by 
facilitating the construction of 
water supply services, capacity 
building of communities to 
plan and manage their water 
demand and ultimately ensure 
sustainability.’
The project was implemented by the 
Aga Khan Foundation, an NGO which 
was supported by HDFC Bank. 
The key goal of the project was to 
accomplish the target of delivering 
potable water via tap connections. 
Over 60 per cent of the project

Financial Literacy 
and Inclusion
In India, a significant portion of the 
population remains excluded from the 
formal economy, missing out on its 
advantages. Without basic financial 
literacy and inclusion, communities 
struggle to progress and engage with 
the broader world. Recognising this 
pressing need, we are committed 
to addressing financial exclusion by 
reaching out to the unbanked and 
under-banked populations in rural, 
semi-urban and urban areas across 
the country. As part of this effort, 
the Bank considers it a responsibility 
to promote financial awareness, 
particularly among marginalised 
sections of society, through 
various initiatives.
Additionally, we conduct financial 
literacy camps and support Self-Help 
Groups (SHGs) to promote financial 
awareness within communities. 
The primary objective of these 
initiatives is to empower individuals 
with the necessary knowledge to 
make informed decisions about their 
finances, thereby enhancing their 
financial well-being.
Dairy Support
The dairy support program 
is instrumental in facilitating a 
substantial shift in the payment 
methods of farmers, moving from 
cash transactions to digital banking. 
This transition effectively addresses 
the challenges associated with 
managing payments in the dairy 
sector and navigating a farmer 
in mainstream banking services. 
Women play a significant role in the 
dairy sector, contributing to various 
aspects of production, processing 
and management. In many states, 
women are actively involved in milking 
cows, feeding livestock, and ensuring 
animal health.
This project is vital to rural 
development & financial inclusion, 
playing a key role in advancing 
the progress and sustainability of 
the rural economy. This project 
further emphasises the larger CSR 
objective of Women Empowerment 
and facilitating their social and 
economic standard.
By fostering credit history and 
embracing digitisation, this program 
significantly elevates banking services 
for dairy farmers. This will also help in 
promoting healthy savings habits in 
farmers which is ultimately contributing 
to financial inclusion for the rural 
economy. Encouraging regular 
deposits, setting achievable savings 
goals and utilising interest-bearing 
accounts are effective strategies to 
build savings over time. By educating 
farmers on the importance of saving 
and providing access to financial 
services in rural areas, we can 
empower communities to secure their 
financial futures and participate more 
fully in the economy.

Dedicated to the 
Nation’s Progress
HDFC Bank actively collaborates with various tiers of 
Government to support its nation-building initiatives. By 
partnering with central, state and local authorities, the 
Bank aids in the efficient collection of diverse revenue 
receipts and the disbursement of welfare schemes. 
Furthermore, HDFC Bank is committed to fuelling the 
growth of the Start-Up ecosystem and actively participates 
in the Government's efforts to foster financial inclusion.

Collecting Taxes
HDFC Bank is one among the top 
three Agency Banks, according to 
data reported by the Press Information 
Bureau and Controller General of 
Accounts, Government of India. An 
area where the Bank has significantly 
stepped–up collections for the 
exchequer is e-freight services. 
Collections grew by 25 times as 
compared to the previous year.
Tax collections through the Bank 
witnessed a 6 per cent growth as 
compared to FY23 and crossed 10 
lakh crore in FY24.
The Bank’s leading position in the 
collection of taxes demonstrates its 
large customer base, wide distribution 
and strong commitment to leveraging 
its strengths to contribute to the overall 
development of the nation.
To enable collection of taxes, the 
Bank is integrated with various central 
Government systems including TIN 2.0 
(Direct Tax), GSTN, ICEGATE (Custom 
Duties) and FOIS. Further, HDFC Bank 
is also integrated with the upgraded 
version of the ICEGATE platform for 
custom duty collections.

Enabling Infrastructure Development
The Government of India is focused on building infrastructure to fuel growth. The Bank works closely with Government 
agencies that drive such development efforts. It enables these Government entities to centrally monitor such projects for 
timely completion and disbursement of payments linked to delivery milestones. This has helped reduce delays and minimise 
cost overruns. 
Digitalise Land 
Acquisition
Online Collection

Integration with 
the Government’s 
Auction Platform
Availability of land 
is a key prerequisite 
for infrastructure 
development. The Bank 
has helped digitalise 
land acquisition as well 
as the compensation 
process for those 
affected by the project.
The Bank has also 
helped in the digital 
transformation of the 
Dedicated Freight 
Corridor Corporation of 
India. It has helped the 
entity to streamline its 
finances and simplify 
payments to vendors.
To increase the 
efficiency of revenue 
collection from services 
linked to national 
highways like foodcourts and petrolpumps, the Bank has 
worked with National 
Highways Logistics 
Management Limited (a 
wholly owned subsidiary 
of National Highways 
Authority of India) to 
facilitate online collection 
of lease rentals from 
such service providers. 
The Bank’s collection 
channels like payment 
gateways have been 
integrated with the 
Government’s auction 
platform to help 
monetise its assets. 
Assets worth over 
H20,000 crores were 
auctioned last year.
Further the Bank has completed 
integration with the PRAKALP Portal 
(Pratyaksh Kar Lekhankan Pranali), a 
system introduced by the Ministry of 
Finance for reporting of direct taxes 
collected by banks. This is key for 
the Government since the PRAKALP 
portal helps it optimise utilisation of the 
collected funds and therefore minimise 
its borrowings.
The Bank has also integrated with 
eSampark centres in Chandigarh 
which enables collection of tax 
through multiple modes across 
47 centres.
Digitalising Local 
Administration
HDFC Bank has continued to drive 
digitalisation of local administration 
by enabling tax collections for local 
bodies and Gram Panchayats.
The Bank has aligned to the 
Government’s Smart City Mission by 
integrating with Smart City Mobile 
Apps. This has accelerated local 
tax collections by delivering 24x7 
availability of payment channels to 
its citizens.
Gram Panchayats play a crucial 
role in the development of the rural 
regions as they implement various 
centrally sponsored schemes. 
The Bank has on-boarded 4,500 
plus Gram Panchayats for smooth 
implementation of the Rashtriya Gram 
Swaraj Abhiyan (RGSA) Scheme and 
collection of taxes through QR and 
PoS solutions.

Disbursement of 
Government Funds
HDFC Bank continues to be one of 
the leading banks to mobilise funds 
under the public welfare schemes. It 
has helped disburse over H1 lakh crore 
by processing 8.81 crore transactions. 
This represents approximately 39 
per cent growth as compared to the 
previous fiscal.
The Bank also handled approximately 
30 per cent of the total funds flowing 
from the Central Government to 
various beneficiaries under the aegis 
of Centrally Sponsored Schemes, 
Central Sector Schemes and the 15th 
Finance Commission.
HDFC Bank continues to be 
committed to supporting the evolving 
financial needs of the Government. 
It continues to invest in necessary 
capacity building and technology 
advancements to achieve this.
The Bank has also enhanced its own 
systems to ensure compliance with 
public expenditure guidelines.
The FARSight Dashboard launched 
last year has been extended to a wider 
base of Government departments. 
The dashboard helps monitor the 
flow and utilisation of funds at various 
levels of the administration.
Partnering with 
Institutions
The Bank aids education and 
religious institutions by advancing 
their digitalisation efforts, facilitating 
smooth fee and donation collection 
processes along with their day-to-day 
activities. It is working with more than 
10,000 institutions to help digitalise 
their collections and payouts, thereby 
improving their overall efficiency.
The Bank continues to expand 
its presence in the key sectors of 
education and religious institutions. 
Relationships were established with 
eminent educational institutions 
like IIMs, NITs, BITS Pilani amongst 
others. Some prominent religious 
institutions on-boarded this past year 
include Shrinathji Temple - Nathdwara, 
Shri Badrinath Kedarnath Mandir 
Samiti, Catholic Mission of Western 
Bengal, Ramakrishna Mission, Sree 
Ayyappan Temple Trust and a chain of 
ISKCON temples.
Collect Now
The Bank’s Collect Now platform has 
gained momentum in the last year. 
This platform helps the Government 
manage its collections more 
efficiently. It brings 15+ online and 
offline payment modes together with 
realtime validations. This has not only 
provided ease of reconciliation but 
also provided them with a seamless 
onboarding experience. Importantly, it 
provides unique benefits such as:
• Single settlement cycle for cards, 
UPI and other online modes
• Unified payout reports across 
collection modes
• A self–service dashboard for 
institutions to track their daily 
collections across various collection 
modes, generate refunds, send 
payment links to customers and 
generate QR codes amongst others
Facilitating Social Security
HDFC Bank provides tailor made 
financial products and services to 
assist pensioners. This includes 
pensioner-specific accounts, 
investment options and retirement 
planning services aimed at maximising 
the value of their pension funds.
The Bank has appointed dedicated 
Nodal Officers for the continuous 
enhancement of its services to 
pensioners. It also participates 
regularly in Pension Adalats to 
understand the needs of this segment.
Further, the Bank has enhanced its 
internal systems for faster onboarding 
of pensioners through digital channels.
HDFC Bank has also extended 
its branch network for Defence 
pensioners to avail various pension 
services. This has been made possible 
by integrating with the SPARSH portal, 
a system implemented by the Principal 
Controller of Defence Accounts 
(Pension).
Further, for the convenience of senior 
citizens, the Bank has extended 
its Doorstep Banking services. 
Integration with Jeevan Praman portal 
of the Government of India has helped 
in submission of digital life certificate 
avoiding the need for a visit to a 
branch for this purpose.
Serving the Defence and 
Railway Establishments
HDFC Bank extends financial services 
to the service providers of the defence 
and railways sectors. This includes 
project financing, working capital 
loans and trade finance. It 
collaborates with Government

streamline financial processes and 
support initiatives aimed at enhancing 
the efficiency and effectiveness of 
these sectors.

HDFC Bank Limited

D I R E C T O R S ’ R E P O R T
Dear Shareholders,
Your Directors take great pleasure in presenting the 30th Annual 
Report on the business and financial operations of your Bank, 
together with the audited accounts for the year ended March 
31, 2024.
The Financial Year 2023-24 was a historic one as the merger 
of parent HDFC Limited with and into HDFC Bank was 
completed. This merger strengthened our position as a 
leading financial conglomerate with marquee financial services 
institutions like HDFC Life Insurance Company Limited, HDFC 
Asset Management Company Limited and HDFC ERGO 
General Insurance Company Limited becoming subsidiaries 
in addition to the existing ones, HDFC Securities Limited and 
HDB Financial Services Limited. 
Coming to the macroeconomic environment, India is expected 
to be one of the fastest growing major economies in the world 
in the Financial Year 2024-25 with the RBI expecting GDP 
growth at 7.2 per cent. 
Over the past three years, the Indian economy grew on an 
average by 8.3 per cent and at 8.2 per cent in FY24. GDP growth 
has been supported by an increase in capital expenditure with 
the Government doing the heavy lifting. Inflationary pressures 
have moderated over the last fiscal year with retail inflation 
averaging at 5.4 per cent in FY24 from 6.7 per cent in FY23.
On the global front, geopolitical tensions could act as a 
headwind for India’s growth and inflation outlook. However, 
while these challenges may pose some risks the resilience 
and momentum shown by the domestic economy in recent 
years suggests that it is well-equipped to navigate any 
potential headwinds.
For more details, please refer to the Macroeconomic 
and Industry section on page no. 220.
Your Bank continued to grow in this environment by conducting 
its business responsibly and reinforcing its commitment to the 
environment and community at large.
Financial Parameters
The Bank’s key financial parameters continued to be 
healthy, primarily attributable to its robust credit evaluation of 
targeted customers and a well-diversified loan book across 
sectors, customer segments and products. Its performance 
is an outcome of its disciplined approach to managing risk 
and return.
The figures for the period ended March 31, 2024 include the 
operations of erstwhile HDFC Limited which amalgamated 
with and into HDFC Bank on July 01, 2023 and hence the 
comparisons with the previous periods have to be looked at 
in light of the same.
Based on Standalone Financial Statements
The income statement reflected a growth in revenue comprising 
Net Interest Income and Non Interest Income. While the former 
grew by 25.0 per cent, the latter grew by 57.7 per cent yearon-year. On an overall basis, Total Net Revenue for the year 
ended March 31, 2024, reached ` 1,57,773.5 crore, reflecting 
an increase of 33.6 per cent over the previous year.

Stepping into a new Era
The merger strengthens our position as a leading financial 
conglomerate with an unwavering commitment to enhancing 
customer service. The fusion of erstwhile HDFC Limited’s 
strong position in the mortgage business and HDFC Bank’s 
operational efficiencies and wider reach, brings significant 
benefits for customers, employees and shareholders, 
amplifying scale and product offerings. 
The Integration Committee, formed in October 2022, played a 
vital role in overseeing the seamless post-merger integration 
of HDFC Bank and erstwhile HDFC Limited. Strategically 
planning and coordinating 32 key workstreams, the committee 
ensured effective implementation and synergy, prioritising 
the minimisation of customer grievances and regulatory 
compliance. Looking ahead, the Bank’s focus remains on 
profitable growth. By leveraging HDFC Limited’s extensive 
home loan customer base, the Bank will strategically implement 
cross selling initiatives, offering need-based products through 
digital journeys without incurring additional acquisition costs. 
We aim to transform our branches into experiential hubs, 
integrating digital innovation with personalised service to 
elevate customer engagement.

Summary
The Indian economy registered an average growth rate of 8.3 
per cent over the last three years, with growth standing at 
8.2 per cent in the Financial Year 2023-24. Going forward, 
India is expected to remain one of the fastest growing major 
economies in the world in FY25, with the RBI projecting GDP 
growth at 7.2 per cent. 
This is expected to be aided by some recovery in consumer 
spending particularly in rural areas. The other positive 
factors that support demand are a normal monsoon, stable 
inflation and expected reduction in interest rates. Your Bank 
is well-positioned to make the most of these opportunities 
by leveraging the strength of its balance sheet and the trust 
enjoyed by its brand. 
It is also committed to supporting nation building particularly 
furthering rural prosperity through both its business and social

Management Discussion and Analysis 
Macroeconomic and Industry Development 
Over the past three years, the Indian economy registered an 
average growth rate of 8.3 per cent. India’s real GDP growth 
has been pegged at 8.2 per cent for FY24 as per the provisional 
estimates released by the National Statistical Office (NSO). 
The GDP growth has been supported by a boost in capital 
expenditure particularly in infrastructure development including 
roads, highways, railways and housing with the Government 
doing the heavy lifting. Additionally, private sector investment 
also showed some signs of resurgence in sectors such as 
cement, steel, oil and gas. 
On the other hand, private consumption growth slowed to 
4.0 per cent in FY24 from 6.8 per cent in FY23 and 11.7 per 
cent in FY22. To recall, post the pandemic, consumption had 
been driven by services along with high demand for premium 
products. However, as this pent-up demand effect waned and 
interest rates started rising consumer demand slowed down in 
FY24. Moreover, high food inflation and an uneven monsoon 
weighed on rural demand recovery. 
As for the supply side, rise in manufacturing and construction 
activity has largely aided growth. The manufacturing sector 
has benefitted from improved profit margins due to lower 
input costs, while Government support schemes such as 
the ECLGS aided MSMEs. Further, favourable infrastructure 
and policy measures like Production Linked Incentive (PLI) 
and FAME 2 Schemes finally paid off for some critical sectors 
like automobiles, electronics (largely mobile handsets) and 
metals. Moreover, the construction sector has maintained an 
average growth rate of 13.1 per cent over the past three years 
supported by Government infrastructure investments and an 
increased housing market demand. 
On the external front, slowdown in global growth significantly 
impacted India’s exports of goods and services in FY24. 
However, expansion of professional and business services 
exports combined with diversification to new markets such as 
Central Asia and Latin America helped cushion the impact of 
the slowdown elsewhere in the global economy.
Going forward, India is expected to remain one of the fastest 
growing economies in the World in FY25 with the RBI forecasting 
a GDP growth rate of 7.2 per cent. Economic activity is expected 
to be supported by a further surge in private capital expenditure 
and continued Government capital spending. Moreover, a 
higher allocation for Production Linked Incentive (PLI) sectors 
in the Budget for FY25 is likely to bolster manufacturing activity 
and attract FDI flows. In addition, a continued diversification 
of supply chains out of China and to other emerging markets 
is likely to channel investment flows into India. Furthermore, 
the International Monetary Fund upgraded its global growth 
forecast by 10 bps to 3.2 per cent for FY24 which bodes well 
for India’s economic growth. In addition, domestic consumer 
spending is expected to see some recovery particularly in rural 
areas as a normal monsoon, stable inflation and a reduction in 
interest rates support demand.
Inflationary pressures have moderated over the last fiscal year, 
with retail inflation averaging at 5.4 per cent in FY24 from 6.7 per 
cent in FY23. Although, retail headline inflation rose to a high 
of 7.4 per cent in July 2023 it has since moderated reaching 
4.83 per cent in April 2024. Encouragingly, core inflation (retail 
inflation excluding food and fuel) has also dipped below 4 per 
cent signalling a disinflationary trend. Going forward, we expect 
retail inflation to average at 4.6 per cent in FY25 assuming 
normal monsoon. Additionally, a favourable economic base 
and controlled core inflation is expected to offer support. That 
said, weather related disturbances such as heatwaves, uneven 
distribution of monsoons along with a resurgence in global 
commodity prices remain a risk to the inflation trajectory.
Emerging risks on the global front could pose challenges to 
India’s growth trajectory and inflation outlook. Higher crude 
oil prices as a result of any escalation in Middle East tensions 
and tighter global oil supply pose a risk for domestic growth 
and inflation. Moreover, the impact of geopolitical tensions on 
global supply chains could hurt India’s exports to major trading 
partners and escalate costs. However, while global challenges 
may pose some risks, the resilience and momentum shown 
by the domestic economy in recent years suggests it is wellequipped to navigate any potential headwinds.

March 31, 2024 remained healthy with Total Net Revenue (Net

on IT resulted in higher infrastructure and staffing expenses.

Total Provisions and Contingencies were ` 23,492.2 crore

credit cards, account opening and investments along with valueadded services such as form filling and details modification as 
well as pre-approved banking products. This comprehensive

reducing the need for human assistance during the application 
process and increasing speed for customers.
The Bank has been a pioneer in digitalisation with initiatives 
like Personal Loan in 10 Seconds, Digital Loan Against Shares,

Continued emphasis is placed on digitalising processes and 
enhancing customer touchpoints to expand the Bank’s reach.
Our Distribution Channel:
The virtual channels of the Bank were set up to enhance 
coverage across customer segments and to ensure a holistic 
service experience to all customers. This is one of the key 
engagement channels in the Bank.
Virtual Relationship Banking is an integrated customer centric 
approach covering three pillars - Virtual Relationship, Virtual 
Sales and Virtual Care serving as a crucial component of 
the Bank’s sales and customer engagement strategy. This 
approach harnesses technology to connect with customers, 
build relationships and promote banking products and services. 
This helps the Bank to expand the managed customer base, 
generate leads and drive revenue growth.
Recognising employees and customers as the capitals for 
this business, your Bank has invested heavily in training and 
development of its relationship managers. Training covers

product knowledge, sales techniques, communication skills, 
compliance and regulatory requirements and customer 
relationship management skills.
As we transition into the digital age, a banking experience 
characterised by digital ease and personalised conversations 
remains at the core of our Virtual Relationship Management 
(VRM) strategy. 
As a part of this strategy, Relationship Managers reach out 
to customers through remote and digital platforms resulting 
in deeper and cost-effective engagement. As digital literacy 
and exposure increases exponentially, VRMs are gaining 
wider acceptance through deeper engagement and 
relationships backed by a strong product offering thereby 
constituting an important component of the Bank’s customer 
engagement strategy.
With proper training, technology support, and adherence to 
compliance, this channel is a highly effective tool for the Bank 
to drive revenue growth, expand its customer base and provide 
excellent customer service.
As of March 31, 2024, the Bank’s distribution network was 
at 8,738 branches and 20,938 ATMs / CRMs across 4,065 
cities / towns as against 7,821 branches and 19,727 ATMs 
across 3,811 cities / towns as of March 31, 2023. 52 per cent 
of our branches are in semi-urban and rural areas. In addition, 
we have 15,182 business correspondents, which are primarily 
manned by Common Service Centres (CSC). The total number 
of customers your Bank catered to as on March 31, 2024 was 
over 9.32 crore, up from over 8.28 crore in the previous year.
Retail Banking - Home Loan Business
Post-merger integration of the erstwhile HDFC Limited’s home 
loan portfolio with the Bank has resulted in scale in terms 
of customer base and book size. This also brings together 
erstwhile HDFC Limited’s segment expertise and in person 
customer connect with HDFC Bank’s extensive branch 
network, ability to leverage technology platforms and a wide 
bouquet of banking products. The Gross Retail Mortgage 
Advances stood at ` 7,72,786 crore compared to the previous 
year’s ` 1,78,840 crore. The figures for the period ended March 
31, 2024 include the operations of erstwhile HDFC Limited 
which amalgamated with and into HDFC Bank on July 01, 2023 
and hence comparisons with the previous periods have to be 
looked at in light of the same. 
As you are aware prior to the merger, your Bank operated in 
the Home Loan Business in conjunction with HDFC Limited. As 
per this arrangement, your Bank sourced HDFC home loans 
while HDFC Limited approved and disbursed them. HDFC 
Bank received a sourcing fee for these loans and as per the 
arrangement had the option to purchase loans for a value up 
to 70 per cent of the loans sourced by the Bank either through 
the issuance of mortgage-backed Pass-Through Certificates 
(PTCs) or a direct assignment of loans. The balance was 
retained by HDFC Limited. 
The Bank is gradually converting erstwhile HDFC Limited’s 
service centres to branches and has a well-defined approach 
for this. Cross-selling remains a primary focus for both existing 
and new customers, leveraging the Bank’s digital channels 
to minimise acquisition costs effectively. Post the merger, 
approximately 85 per cent of the newly acquired home loan 
customers hold a liability account with your bank. Your Bank’s 
market share growth on incremental disbursals is in double 
digits post - merger.
Third Party Products
Your Bank distributes Life, General and Health Insurance as 
well as Mutual Funds (Third Party Products) to its customers. 
In the Financial Year 2023-24, the income from this business 
accounted for 22 per cent of Bank’s Total Fee Income.

offers a range of products and services encompassing working 
capital and term loans, trade credit, cash management,

disbursements streamlining end-to-end SCF transactions for 
the corporates. Your Bank has also integrated with all the three 
TReDS platforms. We are also collaborating with Fintechs to 
integrate with Corporate ERP and offer Embedded Banking in 
Corporate Ecosystems journeys.
Treasury
The Treasury Department is the custodian of your Bank’s cash/
liquid assets and handles its investments in securities, foreign 
exchange and cash instruments. It manages the liquidity and 
interest rate risks on the balance sheet and is also responsible 
for meeting reserve requirements. The vertical also helps 
manage the hedging needs of customers and earns a fee 
income generated from transactions customers undertake 
with your Bank while managing their foreign exchange and 
interest rate risks.
Revenue accrues from spreads on customer transactions 
based on trade and remittance flows and demonstrated 
hedging needs. Your Bank recorded a revenue of ` 4,001.10 
crore from foreign exchange and derivative transactions in the 
year under review. 
As a part of its prudent risk management, your Bank enters into 
foreign exchange and derivatives deals with counterparties after 
it has set up appropriate credit limits based on its evaluation 
of the ability of the counterparty to meet its obligations. Where 
your Bank enters into foreign currency derivatives contracts not 
involving the Indian Rupee with its customers, it typically lays 
them off in the inter-bank market on a matched basis. For such 
foreign currency derivatives, your Bank primarily carries the 
counterparty credit risk (where the customer has crystallised 
payables or ‘mark-to-market’ losses) and may carry only 
residual market risk, if any. Your Bank also deals in derivatives 
on its own account including for the purpose of its own balance 
sheet risk management.
HDFC Bank is also a nominated agent for the bullion imports 
and has a significant market share in that business.
Your Bank maintains a portfolio of Government securities in 
line with the regulatory norms governing the Statutory Liquidity 
Ratio (SLR). A significant portion of these SLR securities are in 
‘Held-to- Maturity’ (HTM) category, while some are ‘Available for 
Sale’ (AFS). The Bank is also a primary dealer for Government 
Securities. As a part of this business, your Bank holds fixed 
income securities as ‘Held for Trading’ (HFT). 
In the year under review, your Bank continued to be a significant 
participant in the domestic exchange and interest rate markets. 
It also capitalised on falling bond yields to book profits and 
is now looking at tapping opportunities arising out of the 
liberalisation in the foreign exchange and interest rate markets.
B. International Business
During the year, your Bank stayed on course to cater to NRI 
clients and deepen its product and service proposition. Your 
Bank has global footprints by way of representative offices and 
branches in countries like Bahrain, Hong Kong, the UAE and 
Kenya. It also has a presence in International Financial Service 
Centre (IFSC) at GIFT City in Gandhinagar, Gujarat. In addition, 
two existing representative offices of erstwhile HDFC Limited 
in London and Singapore have become representative offices 
of the Bank as per the composite scheme of amalgamation 
between HDFC Bank Limited and HDFC Limited. These offices 
are for providing loans-related services for availing housing 
loans in India and for the purchase of properties in India.
The Bank’s product strategy in International Markets is 
customer centric and it has products to cater to client needs 
across asset classes. GIFT City branch offers products such 
as trade credits, foreign currency term loans (including external 
commercial borrowings). It has gradually widening the product 
offerings to cater to the needs of Resident and Non-Resident 
clients and capitalise on the growth in the financial centre. 
As on March 31, 2024, the Balance Sheet size of International 
Business was US $ 9.06 billion. Advances constituted 1.55% 
of the Bank’s advances. The Total Income contributed by 
Overseas Branches constituted 1.51% of the Bank’s Total 
Income for the year.

D. Semi-Urban and Rural
The Semi-Urban and Rural (SURU) markets have always been 
a focus of your Bank’s strategy. In the last few years, your Bank 
has made a renewed push into these markets as rising income 
levels and aspirations of rural customers are leading to demand 
for better quality financial products and services. The Bank has 
been increasing its presence in Semi-Urban and Rural markets 
to cater to these demands. 
Apart from meeting its statutory obligations under PSL (Agri 
and Allied activities, Small and Marginal Farmers and Weaker 
Sections), your Bank has been offering a wide range of products 
on the asset side, such as Auto, Two-Wheeler, Personal, Gold, 
Light Commercial Vehicle (LCV) and Small Shopkeeper Loans 
in these markets. Having expanded the rural footprint to more 
than 2.25 lakh villages, HDFC Bank now plans to increase its 
coverage in existing villages and deepen the relationships. The 
Semi-Urban and Rural push has been backed by the Bank’s 
digital strategy. Your Bank’s operations in Semi-Urban and 
Rural locations are explained below:
Agriculture and Allied Activities
Your Bank’s assets in Agriculture and Allied activities stood at 
` 2,97,609.26 crore as on March 31, 2024.

Distribution strength
Innovative digital solutions
HDFC Bank’s extensive product portfolio encompasses pre 
and post-harvest Crop Loans, Farm Development/Investment 
Loans, Two-Wheeler Loans, Auto Loans, Tractor Loans, Small

targets set by the Government in recent campaigns.
HDFC Bank is increasingly involved in facilitating various 
Government/Regulatory Schemes to other Non-crop 
Segments, including Agri-allied and Small Agri-Business 
Enterprises, as well as Rural MSMEs. A unique business model 
encompassing a wide variety of products and services driven 
by a relationship management approach ensures suitable 
solutions as well as financial literacy to farmers. The Bank has 
tailored a range of crop and geography-specific products to 
align with harvest cycles and address the specific needs of 
farmers across diverse Agro-climatic zones. This customercentric approach has transformed the rural banking services, 
enabling the delivery of personalised offerings to meet the 
evolving needs of rural customers effectively.
HDFC Bank Limited

Products such as post-harvest cash credit and warehouse 
receipt financing facilitate faster cash flows to farmers, while 
credit is also extended for Allied Agricultural Activities such 
as Dairy, Pisciculture, and Sericulture. Moreover, HDFC 
Bank’s Commercial and Rural Banking Group (CRB) plays a 
pivotal role in product development, planning, and monitoring 
strategies for growth. The Bank’s targeted branch expansion in 
SURU regions coupled with digital interventions aims to create 
a superior customer experience and position HDFC Bank as a 
future-ready institution.
Participation in Government Schemes 
As a part of Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan, the Government 
of India has announced several schemes / enablers across 
several sectors, particularly in the Agriculture sector. Your Bank 
is implementing almost all such initiatives / schemes targeting 
multiple stakeholders in the Agri ecosystem.
Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF) Scheme: Through 
this scheme, the Bank is offering medium to long-term debt 
for investment in viable projects pertaining to post-harvest 
management and infrastructure development like construction 
of warehouses/silos. As of March 31, 2024, under the AIF

marginal farmers.
Funding Small and Marginal Farmers (SMFs):
Your Bank views lending to the agriculture sector, including 
to small and marginal farmers, as a huge opportunity and 
not just a regulatory mandate to meet priority sector lending 
requirements. The Bank has leveraged its extensive knowledge 
of rural customers to create as well as deliver products and 
services at affordable price points and with a quick turnaround 
time. This has enabled HDFC Bank to establish a strong 
footprint in the rural geographies which it has now leveraged 
to increase its penetration of liability products.
In the Financial Year 2022-23, your Bank serviced customers 
in 1,65,000 villages. It reached out to the villages through

HDFC Bank has financed and supported 35 lakh Small and 
Marginal Farmers. This was achieved through a strategy 
to engage closely with small and marginal farmers through 
customised agriculture loans. Leveraging the Government 
schemes, it has launched various secured / unsecured loan 
products including Loan Against Gold as security targeting 
small and marginal farmers in Agri and Allied segments.
Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs):
For agriculture productivity and incomes to grow, aggregation 
of farm holdings in the form of FPOs is the key strategy in 
doubling farmers’ income. Leveraging the Government 
scheme for formation and promotion of 10,000 new FPOs 
(Credit guarantee is available from NABARD/CGTMSE), your 
Bank has funded eligible FPOs for working capital and term 
loan requirements. As of March 31, 2024, your Bank was 
able to reach 206 FPOs covering about one lakh small and 
marginal farmers.
Dairy:
Dairy is the largest segment in the agriculture economy, and 
keeping this in mind, your Bank has created a separate team 
of agriculture specialists to cater to this segment. India, boasts 
of a substantial cattle population of over 30 crore, that offers 
a promising landscape for Cattle Finance as well as securing 
liabilities. The country’s agriculture sector, particularly the 
Small and Marginal Farmers (SMF) segment, stands to benefit 
significantly in this scenario, with over 90 per cent of them 
falling within this category. Recognizing the potential for growth 
and financial inclusion, your Bank has initiated a strategic 
programme named ’Dairy Ki Pheri’. This initiative is designed 
to empower milkmen by facilitating their evolution from mere 
milk vendors to dairy entrepreneurs - transforming them from 
Doodh Walas to Doodh Lalas.
During the reporting period, HDFC Bank disbursed a total 
equivalent to ` 1,531 crore to 43,243 cases. Additionally, 
19,000 cases were under active processing. This surge in 
disbursement is noteworthy as it marks a significant increase 
from the average of 1,500 cases per month over the past 8 
months, nearly tripling the previous rate. The disbursement 
primarily focused on small and marginal farmer loans.
In Financial Year 2023-24, the Bank has disbursed an amount 
of ` 8,786 crore to 2,47,533 farmers as Cattle finance.
Digital Interventions
Some of the digital interventions made by your bank include:
Digitising Milk Procurement:
This initiative brings transparency in the milk procurement 
and payment process, which benefits both farmers and dairy 
societies. Multi-function Terminals (MFTs), popularly known 
as Milk-to-Money ATMs, are deployed in dairy societies. The 
MFTs link the milk procurement system of the dairy society to 
the farmer’s account to enable faster payments. MFTs have 
cash dispensers that function as standard ATMs. Payments 
are credited without the hassles of cash distribution. Further, 
this process creates a credit history which can then be used 
for accessing bank credit. Apart from dairy and cattle loans, 
customers gain access to the Bank’s products including digital 
offerings such as 10 Second Personal Loan, Kisan Credit Card 
and Bill Pay. So far, the Bank has digitised payments at over 
357 milk cooperatives across two states, benefitting more than 
2.6 lakh dairy farmers. The Dairy business witnessed 142 per 
cent year-on-year growth in disbursements and 121 per cent 
in the book.
Gold Loans:
Your Bank is making inroads into a market dominated by the 
unorganized sector, moneylenders and pawn brokers. The 
Bank is keen on making the gold loan facility available across 
the length and breadth of the country. As on March 31, 2024, 
the Bank is offering gold loans through 4,604 branches, with 45 
per cent of these branches in Semi-Urban and Rural locations. 
Your Bank is implementing its blueprint of making gold loans 
available in most of its branches and thereby taking this product 
within the reach of otherwise untapped customer segments.
Social Initiatives in Farm Sector
The farm sector faces threats arising out of climate change as 
evident from the growing number of extreme weather events. 
In addition, factors like soil health, input quality (seeds and 
fertilizers), water availability, and Government policy have 
significant impact, along with price realisations and storage 
facilities. All this has an impact on farm yield and income.
Given the vulnerabilities, it is critical to strengthen climate 
resilience and adaptability of the agri-food sector. In this 
context, your Bank has launched a variety of initiatives such as 
Holistic Rural Development Programme (HRDP), Crop Residue 
HDFC Bank Limited
2 3 0

Management Project and many others. Within regulatory 
guidelines, your Bank has also been providing relief to the 
impacted farmers. It also has put in place systems designed 
to enable Direct Benefit Transfers in a time-bound manner.
Lending to the agriculture sector, including to small and 
marginal farmers, is a regulatory mandate as part of priority 
sector lending requirements. The Bank has leveraged its 
extensive knowledge of rural customers to create as well as 
deliver products and services at affordable price points and 
with a quick turnaround time. This has enabled the Bank to 
establish a strong footprint in the rural geographies, which 
it has now leveraged to increase its penetration of liability 
products. Further, your Bank has been working with a segmentspecific approach like funding to horticulture clusters, supply 
chain finance, agri business, MSMEs and dairy farmers. It also 
continues to engage closely with farmers to mitigate risks and 
protect portfolio quality.
Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME)
The MSME sector serves as an important engine for economic 
growth and is one of the largest employers in the economy. 
As on March 31, 2024, your Bank’s assets in the MSME 
segment stood at ` 5,03,598.23 crore. The Micro Enterprises 
assets alone stood at ` 1,69,448 crore. 
The Union Government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) 
have been providing support for lending to MSME segment on 
an ongoing basis. They had provided special support to the 
MSME sector during the pandemic through various schemes, 
such as Interest Moratorium, ECLGS, ECLGS extension and 
COVID support loans. The Government has also launched a 
revamped CGTMSE scheme with increased limit threshold 
for guarantee cover and reduction of guarantee fee. Many 
other schemes like Credit Guarantee to Start Ups (CGSS) and 
Extension of interest subvention have been rolled out. 
Your bank emerged as the largest contributor to CGTMSE in 
FY24, supporting the MSME sector with guarantee-covered 
credit facilities. This has further supported the growth of MSME 
loans which have shown a year-on-year growth of 21.4 per cent. 
The pace of digitalisation among MSMEs has accelerated, 
which has helped to speed up the pace of disbursement 
and increase transparency in the sector. Customers can now 
apply online and submit required documents digitally and 
they can also execute post-sanction agreements digitally to 
avail of facilities quickly with straight-through disbursement. 
The Government’s digitalisation push, the adoption of GST 
and reforms in return filings, such as income tax, have made 
it easier to access customer cash flow and financial data, 
which can be used to support decision making and portfolio 
monitoring. Your Bank’s SME portal continues to offer ad hoc 
approvals and pre-approved Temporary Overdrafts (TODs) on a 
Straight Through Processing (STP) basis to existing customers. 
They can request a top-up of loans and submit the required 
documents online. The SME portal also allows customers 
to access your Bank’s services related to sanctioned credit 
facilities 24/7 from anywhere. Customers can download various 
certificates and statements as needed on an ongoing basis.
On the trade side, your Bank focuses on customer engagement 
to increase the penetration of Trade on Net applications. Trade 
on Net is a complete enterprise trade solution for customers 
engaged in domestic and foreign trade. It enables them to 
initiate and track requests online seamlessly, reducing time 
and costs.
Taking Banking to the Unbanked
As a responsible banker, one of our commitments is extending 
banking solutions to the most remote and farthest regions of the 
country empowering under-banked communities with access 
to formal financial channels. Our widespread physical network 
and a comprehensive suite of digital banking solutions ensure 
broad coverage across India. 52 per cent of our branches are 
situated in semi-urban and rural areas. Our banking solutions 
offer convenient last-mile access through mobile applications 
like BHIM, UPI, USSD, Scan and Pay, as well as Aadhaar and 
RuPay-enabled Micro-ATMs.

monetary losses. Hard disk encryption is implemented on 
all laptops. 
Implementation of Domain-based Message Authentication, 
Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) system for

commonly known as ‘email spoofing’.
Technology related challenges over the past few years have 
only made the Bank’s resolve stronger to consolidate and 
fortify its technology environment. Focused technology / digital 
investments and programs in technology are pivotal to the 
Bank in the new age of digital banking and experiences for 
its customers.
Service Quality Initiatives and Grievance Redressal
Customer Focus is one of the five core values of the Bank. Given 
a highly competitive business environment, especially with 
diverse lines of businesses, we continuously strive to enhance 
customer experience. Delivering exceptional product quality 
and customer service delivery is a prerequisite for sustained 
growth. The Bank strives to achieve this by seeking customer 
feedback, benchmarking with best-in-class business entities 
and implementing customer-centric improvements. We have 
adopted a three-step strategy regarding Customer Service - 
Define, Measure and Improve.
HDFC Bank has adopted a multi-pronged approach to provide 
an omnichannel experience to its customers. On the one 
hand, it has traditional touchpoints like Branches, Email Care 
and PhoneBanking. On the other hand, it has state-of-theart platforms like NetBanking, MobileBanking, WhatsaApp 
Banking, the chatbot Eva and the bank’s exclusive social care 
handles. The Bank also has a Virtual Relationship Manager 
(VRM) programme to cater to various financial needs in a 
personalised manner. 
Customer service performance and grievance redressal are 
regularly assessed at various levels, including Branch Level 
Customer Service Committees, Standing Committee on 
Customer Service and Customer Service Committee of the 
Board. HDFC Bank has implemented robust processes to 
monitor and measure service quality levels across touchpoints, 
including at product and process level, through the efforts of 
the Quality Initiatives Group.
The Service Quality team conducts regular reviews across 
various products, processes and channels, focusing on 
improving the customer experience. A unique Service Quality 
Index (SQI) has been developed to measure the performance 
of key customer facing channels based on critical customer 
service parameters. This SQI enables continuous improvement 
of initiatives to raise service standards. 
One of the basic building blocks of providing acceptable 
level of customer service is to have an effective Internal 
Grievance Redressal Mechanism / Framework. HDFC Bank 
has developed a comprehensive Grievance Redressal Policy, 
Customer Rights Policy, Customer Compensation Policy, 
duly approved by the Board, which outline a framework for 
resolving customer grievances. These policies are accessible 
to customers through the Bank’s website and branch network.
HDFC Bank has created multiple channels for customers 
to provide feedback and register grievances, facilitating a 
transparent and accessible system. As a pioneer in innovative 
financial solutions and digital platforms, it has witnessed an 
increased utilisation of its digital channels. Keeping customer 
interest in focus, the Bank has formulated a Board approved 
Protection Policy which limits the liability of customers in case 
of unauthorised electronic banking transactions. 
This Bank is compliant with the RBI Internal Ombudsman 
Guidelines. At the apex level, as a part of the Internal Grievance 
Redressal mechanism, the Bank has appointed seasonedretired bankers as Internal Ombudsmen to independently 
review any customer grievance which is partly/wholly rejected 
by the Bank before the final decision is communicated to 
the customer.
HDFC Bank is on a journey to measure customer loyalty 
through a high velocity, closed loop customer feedback 
system. This customer experience transformation programme 
helps employees to empathise better with customers and 
improve turnaround times. Branded as ‘Infinite Smiles’, the 
programme helps establish behaviours and practices that result 
in customer-centric actions through continuous improvement 
in products, services, processes and policies.

The Bank remains committed to placing the customer at the 
centre of its operations. By consistently improving customer 
experience, adopting an omnichannel approach and 
implementing robust service quality and grievance redressal 
mechanisms, it aims to build lasting relationships.
Risk Management and Portfolio Quality
Your Bank’s historical focus on Pillar 1 risks including Credit 
Risk, Market Risk and Operational Risk has been expanded 
in response to the evolving banking landscape. Liquidity Risk, 
Climate Risk, Information Technology Risk and Information 
Security Risk have also emerged as critical considerations. 
These risks not only impact your Bank’s financial strength and 
operations but also its reputation. To address these concerns, 
your Bank has established Board-approved risk strategy and 
policies overseen by the Risk Policy and Monitoring Committee 
(RPMC). The Committee ensures that frameworks are 
established for assessing and managing various risks faced by 
your Bank, systems are developed to relate risk to the Bank’s 
capital level and methods are in place for monitoring compliance 
with internal risk management policies and processes. The 
Committee guides the development of policies, procedures 
and systems for managing risks. It ensures that these are 
adequate and appropriate to changing business conditions, 
the structure and needs of your Bank and its risk appetite. 
The hallmark of your Bank’s risk management function is that it 
is independent of the business sourcing unit with convergence 
only at the CEO level.
The gamut of key risks faced by the Bank which are dimensioned 
and managed include:
Credit Risk including Residual Risks
Market Risk
Operational Risk
Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book
Liquidity Risk
Intraday Liquidity Risk
Intraday Credit Risk
Credit Concentration Risk
Counterparty Credit Risk
Model Risk
People Risk
Business Risk
Strategic Risk
Compliance Risk
Reputation Risk
Technology Risk
Third Party Products Risk
Group Risk
Climate Risk
Credit Risk
Credit Risk is the possibility of losses associated with diminution 
in the credit quality of borrowers or counterparties. Losses 
stem from outright default or reduction in portfolio value. Your 
Bank has a comprehensive credit risk architecture, policies, 
procedures, and systems for managing credit risk in its retail 
and wholesale businesses. Wholesale lending is managed on 
an individual as well as portfolio basis. In contrast, given the 
granularity of individual exposures, retail lending is managed 
largely on a portfolio basis across various products and 
customer segments. Robust front-end and back-end systems 
are in place to ensure credit quality and minimise default losses. 
The factors considered while sanctioning retail loans include 
income, demographics, credit history, loan tenure, and banking 
behaviour. In addition, multiple credit risk models are developed 
and used to assess different segments of customers based on 
portfolio behavior. In wholesale loans, credit risk is managed by 
capping exposures based on borrower group, industry, credit 
rating grades and country among others. This is backed by 
portfolio diversification, stringent credit approval processes, 
periodic post-disbursement monitoring and remedial measures. 
Your Bank has ensured strong asset quality through volatile 
times in the lending environment by stringently adhering to 
prudent norms and institutionalised processes. Your Bank also 
has a robust framework for assessing Counterparty Banks, 
which are reviewed periodically to ensure interbank exposures 
are within approved appetite.
As on March 31, 2024, your Bank’s ratio of Gross NonPerforming Assets (GNPAs) to Gross Advances was 1.24 per 
cent. Net Non-Performing Assets (Gross Non-Performing 
Assets Less Specific Loan Loss provisions) was 0.33 per cent 
of Net Advances.
Your Bank has a conservative and prudent policy for specific 
provisions on NPAs. Its provision for NPAs is higher than 
the minimum regulatory requirements and adheres to the 
regulatory norms for Standard Assets.

Digital and Credit Risk
Driven by rapid technological advancements, the banking 
sector is witnessing the increasing importance of digitalisation 
as a critical differentiator for customer retention and service 
delivery. Digital lending has emerged as a convenient and 
quick method for customers to secure loans with just a few 
clicks often in minutes, if not seconds. However, addressing 
the risks associated with digital lending is crucial and your 
Bank has implemented appropriate measures to manage these 
risks effectively. Digital loans are sanctioned primarily to your 
Bank’s existing customers. Often, they are customers across 
multiple products, thus enabling the Bank ready access to their 
credit history and risk profile. This accessibility facilitates the 
evaluation of their loan eligibility. Moreover, the credit checks 
and scores used by your Bank in process-based underwriting 
are replicated for digital loans. This ensures consistency in the 
evaluation process. 
Market Risk
Market Risk arises primarily from your Bank’s statutory reserve 
management and trading activity in interest rates, equity, and 
currency market. These risks are managed through a welldefined Board approved Market Risk Policy, Investment Policy, 
Foreign Exchange Trading Policy, and Derivatives Policy that 
caps risk in different trading desks or various securities through 
trading risk limits / triggers. The risk measures include position 
limits, tenor restrictions, sensitivity limits, namely, PV01, 
Modified Duration of Hold to Maturity Portfolio and Option 
Greeks, Value-at-Risk (VaR) Limit, Stop Loss Trigger Level 
(SLTL), Scenario-based P&L Triggers, Potential Loss Trigger 
Level (PLTL) and are monitored on an end-of-day basis. In 
addition, forex open positions, currency option delta, and 
interest rate sensitivity limits are computed and monitored on 
an intraday basis. This is supplemented by a Board-approved 
stress testing policy and framework that simulates various 
market risk scenarios to measure losses and initiate remedial 
measures. Your Bank’s Market Risk capital charge is computed 
daily using the Standardised Measurement Method applying 
the regulatory factors.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank may not be able to 
meet its financial obligations as they fall due without incurring 
unacceptable losses. Your Bank’s liquidity and interest rate 
risk management framework is spelt out through a welldefined Board approved Asset Liability Management Policy. 
As part of this process, your Bank has established various 
Board-approved limits for liquidity and interest rate risks in 
the banking book. The Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) is a 
decision-making unit responsible for implementing the liquidity 
and interest rate risk management strategy of the Bank in line 
with its risk management objectives and ensures adherence 
to the risk tolerance / limits set by the Board. ALCO reviews 
the policy’s implementation and monitoring of limits. While the 
maturity gap, Basel III ratios and stock ratio limits help manage 
liquidity risk, Net Interest Income impact and market value 
of equity (MVE) impact help mitigate interest rate risk in the 
banking book. This is reinforced by a comprehensive Boardapproved stress testing programme covering both liquidity and 
interest rate risk.
Your Bank conducts various studies to assess the behavioural 
pattern of non-contractual assets and liabilities and embedded 
options available to customers, which are used while managing 
maturity gaps and repricing risk. Further, your Bank has the 
necessary framework to manage intraday liquidity risk.
The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) is one of the Basel 
Committee’s key reforms to develop a more resilient banking 
sector. The LCR, a global standard, is also used to measure 
your Bank’s liquidity position. LCR seeks to ensure that the 
Bank has an adequate stock of unencumbered High-Quality 
Liquid Assets (HQLA) that can be converted into cash easily 
and immediately to meet its liquidity needs under a 30-day 
calendar liquidity stress scenario. The LCR helps in improving 
the banking sector’s ability to absorb shocks arising from 
financial and economic stress, whatever the source, thus 
reducing the risk of spill over from the financial sector to the 
real economy. Based on Basel III norms, your Bank’s average 
LCR stood at 117.35 per cent on a consolidated basis for 
financial year 2023-24 as against the regulatory threshold at 
100 per cent.
The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), a key liquidity risk 
measure under BCBS liquidity standards, is also used to 
measure your Bank’s liquidity position. The NSFR seeks to 
ensure that your Bank maintains a stable funding profile in 
relation to the composition of its assets and off-balance sheet 
activities. The NSFR promotes resilience over a longer-term 
time horizon by requiring banks to fund their activities with 
Average Liquidity Coverage Ratio

Financial Year 2023-24

more stable sources of funding on an ongoing basis. The RBI 
guidelines stipulated a minimum NSFR requirement of 100 per 
cent at a consolidated level and your Bank has maintained the 
NSFR well above 100 per cent since its implementation. Based 
on guidelines issued by RBI, your Bank’s NSFR stood at 120.81 
per cent on a consolidated basis March 31, 2024.
Operational Risk
This is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal 
processes, people and systems or from external events. It also 
includes risk of loss due to legal risk but excludes strategic and 
reputational risk.
Given below is a detailed explanation under four different 
heads: Framework and Process, Internal Control, Information 
Technology and Information Security Practices and Fraud 
Monitoring and Control.
Framework and Process
To manage Operational Risks, your Bank has in place 
a comprehensive Operational Risk Management 
Framework, whose implementation is supervised by the 
Operational Risk Management Committee (ORMC) and 
reviewed by the RPMC of the Board. An independent 
Operational Risk Management Department (ORMD) 
implements the framework. Under the framework, the 
Bank has three lines of defence. The first line of defence 
is the business line (including support and operations).
The first line is primarily responsible for developing risk 
mitigation strategies in managing operational risk for their 
respective units.
The second line of defence is the ORMD, which is 
responsible for implementing the operational risk 
management framework across the Bank. It designs and 
develops tools required for implementing the framework 
including policies and processes, guidelines towards 
implementation and maintenance of the framework. In 
order to achieve the aforesaid objective pertaining to 
operational risk management framework, the ORMC 
guides and oversees the functioning, implementation, and 
maintenance of operational risk management activities of 
Bank, with special focus on:
Identification and assessment of risks across the
Bank through the Risk and Control Self-Assessment 
(RCSA) and Scenario analysis
Measurement of Operational Risk based on the
actual loss data
Monitoring of risk through Key Risk Indicators (KRI)
Management and reporting through KRI, RCSA and
operational risk losses of the Bank
Internal Audit is the third line of defence. The team reviews 
the effectiveness of governance, risk management and 
internal controls within your Bank.
Internal Control
Your Bank has implemented sound internal control 
practices across all processes, units and functions. It has 
well laid down policies and processes for the management 
of its day-to-day activities. Your Bank follows established, 
well-designed controls, which include traditional four eye 
principles, effective segregation of business and support 
functions, segregation of duties, call back processes, 
reconciliation, exception reporting and periodic MIS. 
Specialised risk control units function in risk- prone 
products/ functions to minimise operational risk. Controls 
are tested as part of the SOX control testing framework.
Information Technology and Information
Security Practices
Your Bank operates in a highly automated environment 
and makes use of the latest technologies available on 
cloud or on Premises Data Centres to support various 
business segments. With the advent of new technology 
tools and increased sophistication, your Bank has 
improved its efficiency, reduced operational complexities, 
aided decision making and enhanced the accessibility of 
products and services. This results in various risks such 
as those associated with the use, ownership, operation, 
redundancy, involvement, influence, and adoption of IT 
within an enterprise, as well as business disruption due 
to technological failures. Additionally, it can lead to risks 
related to information assets, data security, integrity, 
reliability and availability, among others. Your Bank 
has put in place a governance framework, Information 
Security Practices, Business Continuity Plan, Disaster 
Recovery (DR) resiliency, Security Enhancements, Public 
Cloud and Cloud Native Services Adoption and Enhanced 
Automated Monitoring mechanisms to mitigate Information 
Technology and Information Security-related risks.

The three lines of defence approach is adopted for 
enterprise-wide Technology Risk management. The first 
line of defence holds primary responsibility of managing 
the risk and ensuring proper controls are in place.
The second line of defence defines policies, frameworks 
and controls. Information Technology Risk function and 
Information Security Group addresses technology and 
information security related risks. A well-documented 
Board-approved information security policy and cyber 
security policy are in place.
Your Bank has a robust Business Continuity and Disaster 
Recovery plan that is periodically tested to ensure that it 
can meet any operational contingencies. Further, there 
is a well-documented crisis management plan in place 
to address the strategic issues of a crisis impacting the 
Bank and to direct and communicate the corporate 
response to the crisis including cyber crisis. In addition, 
employees periodically undergo mandatory business 
continuity awareness training and sensitisation exercises 
on a periodic basis.
For details on Business Continuity, Information 
and Cybersecurity Practices and Data Privacy 
Measures, please refer to pages 82 -87, 235 and 241. 
An independent assurance team within Internal Audit acts 
as a third line of defence that provides assurance on the 
management of IT-related risks.
Fraud Monitoring and Control
Your Bank has put in place a Whistle Blower and Vigilance 
Policy and a central vigilance team that oversees the 
implementation of fraud prevention measures. Frauds 
are investigated to identify the root cause and relevant 
corrective steps are recommended to prevent recurrence.
Fraud Monitoring committees at the senior management 
and Board level also deliberate on high value fraud 
events and advise preventive actions. Periodic 
reports are submitted to the Board and senior 
management committees.
Compliance Risk
Compliance Risk is defined as the risk of impairment of 
your Bank’s integrity, leading to damage to its reputation, 
legal or regulatory sanctions, or financial loss, as a 
result of a failure (or perceived failure) to comply with 
applicable laws, regulations, and standards. Your Bank 
has a Compliance Policy to ensure the highest standards 
of compliance. A dedicated team of subject matter 
experts in the Compliance Department works with 
business, support and operations teams to ensure active 
Compliance Risk management and monitoring. The team 
also provides advisory services on regulatory matters. 
The focus is on identifying and reducing risk by rigorously 
testing products and also putting in place robust internal 
policies. Products that adhere to regulatory norms are 
tested after rollout and shortcomings, if any, are fully 
addressed till the product stabilises. Internal policies 
are reviewed and updated periodically as per agreed 
frequency or based on market actions or regulatory 
guidelines/ actions. The compliance team also seeks 
regular feedback on regulatory compliance from product, 
business and operation teams through self-certifications 
and monitoring.
ICAAP
Your Bank has a structured management framework in the 
Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) 
for the identification and evaluation of the significance of 
the risks that the Bank faces, which may have a material 
adverse impact on its business and financial position. 
The ICAAP framework is guided by the Board approved 
ICAAP Policy.
Group Risk
Post merger, the subsidiaries of your Bank have 
increased manifold from existing two subsidiaries. In 
order to manage the risk arising from subsidiaries with 
regards to potential uncertainties or adverse events that 
can impact the operations, financial stability, reputation 
of the Group, your Bank has established Group Risk 
Management function within the Risk Management 
Group. Your Bank shall have a reasonable oversight on 
the Risk Management Framework of the group entities 
on an ongoing basis through Group Risk Management 
Committee and Council. The Board / Risk Management 
committees of respective subsidiary shall be driving the 
day to day risk management in accordance with the 
requirements of the respective regulator. Stress testing 
for the group is carried out by integrating the stress tests 
of the subsidiaries. Similarly, capital adequacy projections 
HDFC Bank Limited
2 4 0

are formulated for the group after incorporating the 
business / capital plans of the subsidiaries. The Group 
Risk Management Committee shall report to the Bank’s 
Risk Policy & Monitoring Committee (RPMC).
Model Risk
The use of models invariably presents model risk, 
which is the potential for adverse consequences from 
decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs 
and reports. The Model Validation Unit (MVU) under Risk 
Management Group shall be responsible for testing and 
verifying the accuracy and reliability of models used within 
the Bank. By establishing a dedicated MVU, your Bank 
ensures that its models are independently evaluated 
before implementation and on an ongoing basis. There 
is an established Enterprise Model Validation Policy 
(EMVP) which is a centralized, overarching policy whose 
objective is to provide comprehensive guidance on model 
risk management across the Bank. The policy defines the 
roles and responsibilities across stakeholders i.e., Model 
Owners, Model Users, Model Developers, and the Model 
Validation Unit (MVU). There is Model Risk Management 
Committee (MRMC) which is an executive committee to 
govern the Model Risk Management Framework as defined 
in the EMV policy. It shall also oversee the development 
and implementation of EMV policy, governance structure, 
necessary processes and system are put in place and 
review the results of the model validation/monitoring on a 
periodic basis. The MRMC shall report to the Bank’s Risk 
Policy & Monitoring Committee (RPMC).
Climate Risk
The risks from climate change are divided into (i) Physical 
risk which captures economic losses from acute impacts 
on account of extreme weather events or long-term 
chronic impact on environment; and (ii) Transition risks 
which captures financial asset level losses due to the 
possible process of adjustment to a low carbon economy. 
Your Bank has partnered with an independent reputed 
global agency for developing a framework to assess 
climate transition risk at a borrower level for select 
industries. Additionally, your Bank has taken initiatives to 
engage in capacity building programs to familiarize the 
Board and its staff members on the key developments 
in climate risk assessment, considering this risk is 
continuously evolving.
Further your bank has formulated its ESG policy and 
ESG & Climate Change Assessment Framework which 
is integrated into bank’s credit appraisal process.
Stress Testing Framework
Your Bank has implemented a Board approved Stress 
Testing Policy and Framework which forms an integral 
part of the Bank’s ICAAP. Stress testing involves the use 
of various techniques to assess your Bank’s potential 
vulnerability to extreme but plausible stressed business 
conditions. The changes in the levels of Pillar I risks and 
select Pillar II risks, along with the changes in the on and 
off-Balance Sheet positions of your Bank are assessed 
under assumed ‘stress’ scenarios and sensitivity factors. 
The suite of stress scenarios includes topical themes 
depending on prevailing geopolitical / macroeconomic / 
sectoral and other trends. The stress testing outcome may 
be analysed through capital impact and/or identification 
of vulnerable borrowers depending on the scenario.
Business Continuity Planning (BCP)
Your Bank has a strong BCP programme in place that 
enables operational resilience and continuity in delivering 
quality services across various business cycles. With 
our ISO 22301:2019 certified Business Continuity 
Programme, we prioritise minimising service disruptions 
and safeguarding our employees, customers and business 
during any unforeseen adverse events or circumstances. 
The Programme is designed in accordance with the 
guidelines issued by regulatory bodies. Further our 
programme undergoes regular internal, external and 
regulatory reviews. 
The central Business Continuity Office focuses on 
strengthening the Bank’s preparedness for continuity. 
Oversight over programme is provided by the Business 
Continuity Steering Committee, chaired by the Chief 
Risk Officer. The Business Continuity Procedure outlines 
clear roles and responsibilities for teams involved in 
Crisis Management, Business Recovery, Emergency 
Response, and IT Disaster Recovery, ensuring a 
coordinated approach.

customers through disruptive events and beyond.
Internal Controls, Audit and Compliance
Your Bank has put in place extensive internal controls 
and processes that are commensurate with the size and 
scale of the Bank to mitigate Operational and other allied 
risks, including centralised operations and ‘segregation 
of duty’ between the front and back-office. The frontoffice units usually act as customer touchpoints and 
sales and service outlets while the back-office carries 
out the entire processing, accounting and settlement 
of transactions in the Bank’s core banking system. The 
policy framework, definition and monitoring of limits is 
carried out by various mid-office and risk management 
functions. The credit sanctioning and debt management 
units are also segregated and do not have any sales and 
operations responsibilities.
Your Bank has set up various executive-level committees 
with participation from various business and control 
functions that are designed to review and oversee 
matters pertaining to capital, assets and liabilities, 
business practices and customer service, operational 
risk, information security, business continuity planning 
and internal risk-based supervision among others. The 
second line of defence functions set standards and lay 
down policies and procedures by which the business 
functions manage risks, including compliance with 
applicable laws, compliance with regulatory guidelines, 
adherence to operational controls and relevant standards 
of conduct. At the ground level, your Bank has a mix of 
preventive and detective controls implemented through 
systems and processes, ensuring a robust framework in 
your Bank to enable correct and complete accounting, 
identification of outliers (if any) by the management 
on a timely basis for corrective action and mitigating 
operational risks.
Your Bank has put in place various preventive controls, including:
Limited and need-based access to systems by users
Dual custody over cash and near-cash items
Segregation of duty in processing of transactions vis-à-vis
creation of user IDs
Segregation of duty in processing of transactions vis-à-vis
monitoring and review of transactions/ reconciliation
Four eye principle (maker-checker control) for processing
of transactions
Stringent password policy
Booking of transactions in core banking system mandates
the earmarking of line/limit (fund as well as non-fund 
based) assigned to the customer
STP processes between core banking system and
payment interface systems for transmission of messages
Additional authorisation leg in payment interface systems
in applicable cases
Audit logs directly extracted from systems
Empowerment grid
Your Bank also has detective controls in place:
Periodic review of user IDs and its usage logs
Post-transaction monitoring at the back-end by way
of call back process (through daily log reports) by an 
independent person, i.e., to ascertain that entries in the 
core banking system/messages in payment interface 
systems are based on valid/authorised transactions and 
customer requests

Reconciliation of all internal / transitory accounts and
establishment of responsibility in case of outstanding
Independent and surprise checks periodically
by supervisors.
Your Bank has an Internal Audit Department which is responsible 
for independently evaluating the adequacy and effectiveness 
of internal controls, risk management, governance systems 
and processes and is manned by appropriately qualified and 
experienced personnel.
This department adopts a risk-based audit approach and 
carries out audits across various businesses i.e., Retail, 
Wholesale and Treasury (for India and Overseas books), 
Audit of Operations units, Management and Thematic audits, 
Information Security audit, Revenue audit, Spot checks and 
Concurrent audit in order to independently evaluate the 
adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls on an ongoing 
basis and proactively recommending enhancements thereof. 
The Internal Audit Department, during the course of audit, also 
ascertains the extent of adherence to regulatory guidelines, 
legal requirements and operational processes and provides 
timely feedback to the management for corrective actions. A 
strong oversight on the operations is also kept through off-site 
monitoring by use of data analytics and automation tools to 
study trends/patterns to detect outliers (if any) and alert the 
management for due corrective action, wherever warranted.
The Internal Audit Department also independently reviews 
your Bank’s implementation of Internal Rating Based (IRB)- 
approach for calculation of capital charge for Credit Risk, the 
appropriateness of your Bank’s ICAAP, as well as evaluates 
the quality and comprehensiveness of your Bank’s disaster 
recovery and business continuity plans and also carries out 
management self-assessment of adequacy of the Bank’s 
internal financial controls and operating effectiveness of 
such controls in terms of Sarbanes Oxley (SOX) Act and 
Companies Act, 2013. The Internal Audit Department plays 
an important role in strengthening of the control functions by 
periodically reviewing their practices and processes as well as 
recommending enhancements thereof. Additionally, oversight 
is also kept on the functioning of the subsidiaries, related 
party transactions and extent of adherence to the licensing 
conditions of the RBI.
Any new product/process introduced in your Bank is reviewed 
by Compliance function in order to ensure adherence to 
regulatory guidelines. The Audit function may, if deemed 
necessary also proactively recommend improvements in 
operational processes and service quality for such new 
products / processes.
To ensure independence, the Internal Audit Function 
has a reporting line to the Audit Committee of the Board 
and a dotted line reporting to the Managing Director for 
administrative purposes. 
The Compliance function independently tracks, reviews and 
ensures compliance with regulatory guidelines and promotes 
a compliance culture in the Bank.
Your Bank has a comprehensive Know Your Customer (KYC), 
Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Combating Financing of 
Terrorism (CFT) policy (based on the RBI guidelines / provisions 
of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002) incorporating 
the key elements of Customer Acceptance Policy, Customer 
Identification Procedures, Risk Management and Monitoring of 
Transactions. The policy is subjected to an annual review and 
is duly approved by the Board.
Your Bank besides having robust controls in place to ensure 
adherence to the KYC guidelines at the time of account opening 
also has monitoring process at various stages of the customer 
lifecycle including a continuous review process in the form of 
transaction monitoring carried out by a dedicated AML and 
CFT monitoring team which carries out transaction reviews for 
identification of suspicious patterns/trends that enables your 
Bank to further carry out enhanced due diligence (wherever 
required) and appropriate actions thereafter.
The Audit team and the Compliance team undergo regular 
training both in-house and external to equip them with the 
necessary knowhow and expertise to carry out the function.
The Audit Committee of the Board reviews the effectiveness 
of controls, compliance with regulatory guidelines as also the 
performance of the Audit and Compliance functions in your 
Bank and provides direction, wherever deemed fit. The Audit 
function is also subject to periodic external assurance reviews. 
Your Bank has always adhered to the highest standards of 
compliance and has put in place appropriate controls and risk 
measurement and risk management tools to ensure a robust 
compliance and governance structure.

Amongst the Bank’s key subsidiaries, HDFC Life Insurance 
Company Limited and HDFC ERGO General Insurance 
Company Limited prepare their financial results in accordance 
with Indian GAAP and other subsidiaries do so in accordance 
with the notified Indian Accounting Standards (‘Ind-AS’). 
The detailed financial performance of the companies is 
given below. 
HDFC Securities Limited (HSL)
HSL’s Total Income under Indian Accounting Standards for the 
year ended March 31, 2024 was ` 2,660.7 crore as against 
` 1,891.6 crore in the previous financial year. Net Profit was 
` 950.9 crore for the year ended March 31, 2024 as against 
` 777.2 crore in the previous financial year. The company has 
a customer base of 53.82 lakh to whom it offers an exhaustive 
range of investment and protection products. In the year 
under review, HSL had 12.14 lakh transacting customers. The 
focus on digitalisation continued. Notably, 95 per cent of its 
customers accessed its services digitally, against 92 per cent 
in the previous year.
In a conscious effort to rationalise the distribution network 
with greater emphasis on digital offerings, HSL consolidated 
its existing branches to end with 184 branches across 139 
cities / towns at the end of the year. It created digital boarding 
journeys which led to more than 90 per cent of customers 
being onboarded digitally.
In the case of Margin Trade Funding (MTF), the Average Book 
Size during the year was ` 4,855 crore, against the average 
book size of ` 3,190 crore in the last financial year. The Book 
Size for the year ended March 31, 2024 stands at ` 6,033 crore.
HSL launched its flat price broking app, HDFC SKY in 
September 2023. HDFC SKY has a one-price slab of ` 20 for 
both intraday and delivery across segments, MTF at 12 per 
cent and zero account opening and maintenance charges for 
the first year.
HDFC SKY is designed to support investors and traders across 
experience levels to participate seamlessly in the financial 
markets and achieve their financial goals. The app provides 
access to various investment and trading offerings, including 
Indian stocks, ETFs, Mutual Funds, Futures and Options,

single Fintech platform. Its users are spread across Tier-1, 2 
and 3 cities.
The platform is best placed to help its customers with 
investment and stock recommendations and proprietary 
research to enable better and informed decision-making. 
The Indian stock market witnessed an exceptional rally in 
the Financial Year 2023-24 marking multiple record highs. It 
was one of the best performing major markets after Japan’s 
Nikkei. In Financial Year 2023-24, Nifty50 rose 28.6 per cent, 
while the BSE Sensex was up 24.8 per cent. This remarkable 
performance can be attributed to robust retail participation 
and strong Foreign Portfolio Investor (FPI) inflows triggered by 
buoyant economic growth and healthy corporate earnings. 
An increase in foreign investments in the Indian stock market

efforts put in by the Bank’s employees and look forward to 
their continued contribution. 
Conclusion
The year under review witnessed the amalgamation of erstwhile 
HDFC Limited with and into HDFC Bank. This has opened up 
immense opportunities through the fusion of e-HDFC Limited’s 
home loan expertise with HDFC Bank’s operational efficiencies 
and wider reach. The amalgamation also offers huge prospects 
for cross sell. All in all, it is going to be a key driver for future 
growth. The under penetration of banking services in India is 
an opportunity by itself. HDFC Bank is well placed to capitalise 
on this given its inherent balance sheet and brand strengths. 
While chasing growth, the Bank will not lose sight of adhering 
to corporate governance standards, serving customers in a 
transparent way and treating employees fairly.

*As per the salary review approval process of the
Reserve Bank of India, the salary increment proposal to 
be effected from April 01 in a given financial year can 
only be made in the subsequent financial year post 
assessment of performance for the reference financial 
year. For e.g. salary increment proposal to be made to 
the RBI effective April 01, 2023 can only be made post 
assessment of performance for the financial year 2023 - 
2024. The approval received from the RBI will therefore 
be retrospectively applied from April 01, 2023. In light of 
aforementioned process, the salary increase given in the 
particular year will always be reported as zero.

Director and Executive Director in FY 2022-23 was 
3.97% and 6.95% respectively. The remuneration for the

Report on Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Opinion 
We have jointly audited the accompanying Standalone Financial Statements of HDFC Bank Limited (“the Bank”), which
comprise the Standalone Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2024, and the Standalone Profit and Loss Account and the 
Standalone Cash Flow Statement for the year then ended, and notes to the Standalone Financial Statements including a 
summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid Standalone
Financial Statements give the information required by the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 as well as the Companies Act, 2013 
(“the Act”) in the manner so required for banking companies and are in conformity with accounting principles generally 
accepted in India and give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Bank as at March 31, 2024, and its profit and its 
cashflows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our
responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Standalone 
Financial Statements” section of our report. We are independent of the Bank in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the

we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the
Standalone Financial Statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the

on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in

Identification and Provisioning of Non-performing Advances (NPA): 
Total NPA as at March 31, 2024: 31,056.65 Crores 
Provision for NPA as at March 31, 2024: 22,966.09 Crores
(Refer Schedule 17 (C)(3), Schedule 18 note 9)
Key Audit Matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
The Bank is required to comply with the Master Circular dated April 
01, 2023 issued by the Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) on “Prudential 
Norms on Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning 
pertaining to Advances” (the “IRAC norms”) and amendments thereto, 
which prescribe the guidelines for identification and classification of 
Non-performing Advances and the minimum provision required for 
such assets.
The Bank is also required to apply its judgement to determine the 
identification and provision required against Non-performing Advances 
considering various quantitative as well as qualitative factors. The 
identification of Non-performing Advances is also affected by factors 
like stress and liquidity concerns in certain sectors.
The provision for identified Non-performing Advances is estimated 
based on ageing and classification of Non-performing Advances, 
nature of product, value of security etc., and is also subject to the 
minimum provisioning norms specified by RBI. Since the identification 
of Non-performing Advances and provisioning for Non-performing 
Advances requires considerable level of management estimation, 
application of various regulatory requirements and in view of its 
significance to the overall audit, we have identified this as a key audit 
matter.
Our audit procedures included the following:
 Understood the process and controls, and tested the design and 
operating effectiveness of key controls, including Information 
Technology based controls, and focused on the following:
• Monitoring of credit quality which amongst other things
includes the monitoring of overdue loan accounts and 
drawing power;
• Identification 
and 
classification 
Non-performing
Advances in accordance with IRAC norms, other 
regulatory guidelines issued by the RBI and consideration 
of qualitative aspects; and
• Testing of application controls including testing of
automated controls and reports. 
 Evaluated the governance process and controls over calculations 
of provision for Non-performing Advances and tested that the 
basis of provisioning is in accordance with the Board of Directors 
approved policy and IRAC norms.
 With respect to classification of Non-performing Advances,
verified the date of Non-performing Advances and recomputed 
the Days Past Due on a sample basis. 
 On a test check basis, verified the classification of accounts
reported by the Bank as Special Mention Accounts (‘SMA’) 
in RBI’s Central Repository of Information on Large Credits 
(‘CRILC’).
 With respect to provisions recognised towards Non-performing
Advances, provision calculations on a sample basis taking 
into consideration the value of security, where applicable, the 
IRAC norms and the policy of the Bank, and compared our 
outcome to that prepared by the management and tested 
relevant assumptions and judgements which were used by the 
management.

erstwhile HDFC Limited to the Bank, including integration of some 
systems with the financial reporting system and other related 
applications of the Bank; and transfer of underlying financial data of 
the erstwhile HDFC Limited’s business.
Further, the Bank had sought certain forbearances from the RBI. The 
RBI has granted certain forbearances and provided clarifications to 
the Bank through various communications.
Considering the magnitude of the amounts involved, complexity of the 
transaction and the related adjustments (including those related to IT 
systems impacting financial reporting) impacting Standalone Financial 
Statements, and in view of its significance to the overall Standalone 
Financial Statements, we have determined the accounting for the 
amalgamation and the related adjustments (including those to IT 
systems impacting financial reporting) and communications with RBI 
relating to the amalgamation, to be a key audit matter.
Our audit procedures included the following:
 Understood the process and controls, and tested the design
and operating effectiveness of key controls, including 
Information Technology general and application controls relating 
to accounting for amalgamations, and integration of IT Systems 
(impacting financial reporting) of erstwhile HDFC Limited; 
 Perused the NCLT approved Scheme of Amalgamation for the
appropriateness of determination of the effective date of the 
scheme and the accounting treatment as prescribed in the 
Scheme;
 Traced the assets and liabilities of erstwhile HDFC Limited
recognised on amalgamation to the special purpose financial 
information as at the appointed and effective date of the 
Scheme, audited by other auditors;
 Tested the share swap and amalgamation adjustments for
appropriate recording of the resultant impact on the standalone 
reserves of the Bank;
 Tested on a sample basis the underlying financial data of erstwhile 
HDFC Limited transferred to the Bank and its integration with the 
financial information of the Bank as on the effective date;
 Read communications of the Bank with the RBI seeking certain
forbearances relating to the operations of the Bank post the 
amalgamation, having an impact on the financial reporting and 
assessed their impact on the standalone financial statements; 
 Assessed the adequacy and appropriateness of the disclosures
relating to the amalgamation made in the standalone financial 
statements.

Information Technology (“IT”) Systems and Controls impacting Financial Reporting
Key Audit Matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
The IT environment of the Bank is complex and involves a large 
number of independent and interdependent IT systems used in the 
operations of the Bank for processing and recording a large volume 
of transactions.
As a result, there is a high degree of reliance and dependency on such 
IT systems for the financial reporting process of the Bank.
Appropriate IT general controls and IT application controls are required 
to ensure that such IT systems are able to process the data as required, 
completely, accurately, and consistently for reliable financial reporting.
We have identified certain key IT systems (“in-scope” IT systems) 
which have an impact on the financial reporting process and the 
related controls testing as a key audit matter because of the high 
level of automation, significant number of systems being used by 
the Bank for processing financial transactions, the complexity of the 
IT architecture and its impact on the financial records and financial 
reporting process of the Bank.
Our procedures with respect to this matter included the following:
 In assessing the controls over the IT systems of the Bank, we
involved our technology specialists to obtain an understanding 
of the IT environment, IT infrastructure and IT systems. We 
evaluated and tested relevant IT general controls over the “inscope” IT systems and IT dependencies identified as relevant 
for our audit of the standalone financial statements and financial 
reporting process of the Bank. On such “in-scope” IT systems, 
we tested key IT general controls with respect to the following 
domains:
 Program change management, which includes that
program changes are moved to the production 
environment as per defined procedures and relevant 
segregation of environment is ensured.
 User access management, which includes user access
provisioning, de-provisioning, access review, password 
management, sensitive access rights and segregation 
of duties to ensure that privilege access to applications, 
operating systems and databases in the production 
environment were granted only to authorized personnel.
 Program development, which includes controls over IT
application development or implementation and related 
infrastructure, which are relied upon for financial reporting.
 IT operations, which includes job scheduling, monitoring
and backup and recovery.
 We also evaluated the design and tested the operating
effectiveness of relevant key IT dependencies within the key 
business process, which included testing automated controls, 
automated calculations / accounting procedures, interfaces, 
segregation of duties and system generated reports, as 
applicable.
 We communicated with those charged with governance and
management and tested a combination of compensating 
controls or remediated controls and / or performed alternative 
audit procedures, where necessary.
Other Information
The Bank’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information
included in the Annual Report, but does not include the Standalone Financial Statements and our auditor’s report thereon. 
The Annual Report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any form 
of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified 
above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the 
Standalone Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

When we read the Annual Report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to 
communicate the matter to those charged with governance and take appropriate action as applicable under the relevant 
laws and regulations.
Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the Standalone Financial 
Statements
The Bank’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the
preparation of these Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial 
performance and cash flows of the Bank in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, 
including the Accounting Standards specified under Section 133 of the Act, and the provisions of Section 29 of the Banking 
Regulations Act, 1949 and circulars, guidelines and directions issued by the Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) from time to 
time. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of 
the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Bank and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection 
and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and 
design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring 
the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Standalone 
Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, management is responsible for assessing the Bank’s ability to continue
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative 
but to do so. Those Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Bank’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs 
will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these Standalone Financial Statements. 
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism
throughout the audit. We also:
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due to
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate
in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether 
the Bank has adequate internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements in place and the 
operating effectiveness of such controls. 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by management. 
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant 
HDFC Bank Limited
2 8 4

doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are 
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the Standalone Financial Statements or, 
if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained 
up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue 
as a going concern. 
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Standalone Financial Statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the Standalone Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a 
manner that achieves fair presentation.
10. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing
of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during 
our audit. 
11. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought 
to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. 
12. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most
significance in the audit of the Standalone financial statements of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We 
describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, 
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
Other Matter
13. The special purpose financial information of erstwhile HDFC Limited as at the day beginning of July 1, 2023 (i.e. the appointed
and effective date for the Scheme) considered to give effect to the scheme as on that date was audited by other auditors, 
whose report expressing an unmodified opinion thereon, has been furnished to us by the Management. Our opinion is not 
modified in respect of above matter.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements 
14. In our opinion, the Standalone Balance Sheet and the Standalone Profit and Loss Account have been drawn up in
accordance with the provisions of Section 29 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and Section 133 of the Act. 
15. As required by sub-section (3) of Section 30 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, we report that:
(a) 
we have obtained all the information and explanations which, to the best of our knowledge and belief, were necessary
for the purpose of our audit and have found them to be satisfactory;
(b) 
the transactions of the Bank which have come to our notice have been within the powers of the Bank, other than those 
relating to leasing of immovable properties acquired on amalgamation of the erstwhile HDFC Limited with the Bank, 
as disclosed in Schedule 18 note 1 to the Standalone Financial Statements; and
(c) 
during the course of our audit, we have visited 90 branches to examine the books of account and other records
maintained at the branch and performed other relevant audit procedures. Since the key operations of the Bank are 
automated with the key applications integrated to the core banking system, the audit is carried out centrally at Bank’s 
Head office located in Mumbai, as all the necessary records and data required for the purposes of our audit are 
available there.

(b) The management has represented that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, other than as disclosed in the 
Schedule 18 note 34, no funds have been received by the Bank from any person(s) or entity(ies), including

not enabled throughout the year for certain masters in two accounting software and for databases (also, refer 
Schedule 18 note 35 to the Standalone financial statements of the Bank). Based on our procedures performed, 
we did not notice any instance of the audit trail feature being tampered with. In respect of the aforesaid masters

audit trail was tampered with, does not arise.

Annexure A to Independent Auditor’s Report
Referred to in paragraph 16(g) of the Independent Auditor’s Report of even date to the members of HDFC Bank Limited on the 
Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024
Report on the Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements under 
clause (i) of sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Act
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements of HDFC Bank Limited
(“the Bank”) as of March 31, 2024 in conjunction with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the Bank for the 
year ended on that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The Bank’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal
control over financial reporting criteria established by the Bank considering the essential components of internal control 
stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (“the Guidance Note”) issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”).These responsibilities include the design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient 
conduct of its business, including adherence to Bank’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection 
of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable 
financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bank’s internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial
Statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on 
Auditing deemed to be prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial 
controls, both applicable to an audit of internal financial controls and both issued by the ICAI. Those Standards and the 
Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements was 
established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects. 
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls
system with reference to Standalone Financial Statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial 
controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls 
with reference to Standalone Financial Statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and 
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected 
depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone 
Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion
on the Bank’s internal financial controls system with reference to Standalone Financial Statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements
A Bank’s internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Standalone Financial Statements 
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Bank’s internal financial controls with 
reference to Standalone Financial Statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance 
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the 
Bank; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of Standalone 
Financial Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of 
HDFC Bank Limited
2 8 8

the Bank are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the Bank; and (3) provide 
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the Bank’s 
assets that could have a material effect on the Standalone Financial Statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements, including 
the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may 
occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone 
Financial Statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone 
Financial Statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with 
the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
Opinion
In our opinion, the Bank has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system with reference to
Standalone Financial Statements and such internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements 
were operating effectively as at March 31, 2024, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established 
by the Bank considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued by ICAI.

SCHEDULES TO THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
As at March 31, 2024
Schedule 17 - Significant accounting policies 
appended to and forming part of the standalone 
financial statements for the year ended March 31, 

A. BACKGROUND
 HDFC BANK Limited (‘HDFC Bank’ or the ‘Bank’), 
incorporated in Mumbai, India is a publicly held banking 
company engaged in providing a range of banking and 
financial services including retail banking, wholesale 
banking and treasury operations. The Bank is governed 
by the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and the Companies 
Act, 2013. During the year, scheme for amalgamation 
of (i) erstwhile HDFC Investments Limited (“eHDFC 
Investments”) and erstwhile HDFC Holdings Limited 
(“eHDFC Holdings”) with and into erstwhile Housing 
Development Finance Corporation Limited (“eHDFC 
Limited”); and thereafter (ii) eHDFC Limited into the 
Bank became effective from July 01, 2023, upon receipt 
of all requisite approvals and accordingly the financial 
statements include the operations of eHDFC Limited, 
eHDFC Investments and eHDFC Holdings from July 01, 
2023 onwards. The Bank has overseas branch operations 
in Bahrain, Hong Kong, Dubai and Offshore Banking Unit 
at International Financial Service Centre (IFSC), GIFT City, 
India. The financial accounting systems of the Bank are 
centralised and, therefore, accounting returns are not 
required to be submitted by branches of the Bank. 
BASIS OF PREPARATION
The standalone financial statements have been prepared 
and presented under the historical cost convention and 
accrual basis of accounting, unless otherwise stated and 
are in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting 
Principles in India (‘Indian GAAP’), statutory requirements 
prescribed under the Third Schedule of the Banking 
Regulation Act, 1949, directions, circulars, notifications 
and guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India (‘RBI’) 
from time to time (RBI guidelines), Accounting Standards 
(‘AS’) specified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 
2013 read together with the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 
2014 and the Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 
2021, in so far as they apply to banks.
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with 
Indian GAAP requires the management to make estimates 
and necessary assumptions in the reported amounts of 
assets and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) as 
at the date of the financial statements and the reported 
income and expenses for the reporting year. Management 
believes that the estimates used in the preparation of the 
financial statements are prudent and reasonable. Actual 
results could differ from these estimates. The impact of 
any revision in the accounting estimates is recognised 
prospectively from the period of change.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Investments
 
Classification:
In accordance with the RBI guidelines, investments are 
classified on the date of purchase into “Held for Trading” 
(‘HFT’), “Available for Sale” (‘AFS’) and “Held to Maturity” 
(‘HTM’) categories (hereinafter called “categories”). 
Subsequent shifting amongst the categories is done 
in accordance with the RBI guidelines. Under each of 
these categories, investments are further classified under 
six groups (hereinafter called “groups”) - Government 
Securities, Other Approved Securities, Shares, 
Debentures and Bonds, Investments in Subsidiaries / 
Joint Ventures and Other Investments.
Purchase and sale transactions in securities are accounted 
on settlement date except in the case of equity shares 
which are accounted on trade date.
Basis of classification:
Investments that are held for resale within 90 days from 
the date of purchase are classified under HFT category. 
Investments which the Bank intends to hold till maturity are 
classified under HTM category. Investments in the equity 
of subsidiaries / joint ventures are classified under HTM 
category. Investments which are not classified in either of 
the above categories are classified under AFS category.
Acquisition cost: 
Costs, including brokerage and commission paid at the 
time of acquisition of investments and broken period 
interest on debt instruments, are recognised in the Profit 
and Loss Account and are not included in the cost 
of acquisition.
Disposal of investments:
Profit / Loss on sale of investments under the aforesaid 
three categories is recognised in the Profit and Loss 
Account. Cost of investments is determined based on 
the weighted average cost method. The profit from sale of 
investment under HTM category, net of taxes and transfer 
to statutory reserve is appropriated from the Profit and 
HDFC Bank Limited
3 0 4

Loss Account to “Capital Reserve”, in accordance with 
RBI guidelines.
Short sale:
The Bank undertakes short sale transactions in Central 
Government dated securities in accordance with the RBI 
guidelines. The short position is categorised under HFT 
category and netted off from investments in government 
securities. The short position along with other government 
securities under HFT portfolio is marked to market and 
the resultant loss, if any, is charged to the Profit and Loss 
Account while gain, if any, is ignored. Profit / Loss on short 
sale is recognised on settlement date.
 
Valuation:
Investments classified under AFS and HFT categories
are marked to market individually and depreciation 
/ appreciation is aggregated for each group. Net 
depreciation, if any, compared to the acquisition 
cost, in any of the six groups, is charged to the Profit 
and Loss Account. The net appreciation, if any, in 
any of the six groups is not recognised except to 
the extent of depreciation provided earlier. The book 
value of individual securities is not changed on such 
revaluation of investments.
Quoted investments are valued based on the trades / 
quotes on the recognised stock exchanges or prices 
published by Financial Benchmarks India Pvt Ltd. 
(FBIL) or Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives 
Association (FIMMDA). Investments denominated in 
foreign currencies are valued based on the prices 
provided by market information providers such as 
Bloomberg, Refinitiv, etc.
Unquoted Government of India securities, state
government securities and special bonds such as oil 
bonds, fertilizer bonds etc. issued by the Government 
of India are valued as per the prices published by 
FBIL. The valuation of other unquoted fixed income 
securities (viz. other approved securities and bonds 
and debentures), and preference shares, is done 
with appropriate mark-up, i.e. applicable FIMMDA 
published credit spread over the Yield to Maturity 
(YTM) rates for Government of India securities as 
published by FBIL.
Unquoted equity shares are valued at the breakup value, ascertained from the company’s latest 
balance sheet. The date as on which the latest 
balance sheet is drawn up shall not precede the 
date of valuation by more than 18 months. In case 
the latest audited balance sheet is not available or is 
more than 18 months old, the shares shall be valued 
at ` 1 per company.
Units of mutual funds are valued at the latest Net
Asset Value (NAV) declared by the mutual fund. 
Treasury bills, commercial papers and certificate of
deposits being discounted instruments, are valued 
at carrying cost. 
Investments in Security Receipts (SRs) and unquoted 
units of Infrastructure Investment Trust (InvIT) are 
valued as per the net asset value provided by the 
issuing Asset Reconstruction Company and InvIT 
respectively. 
Investments in unquoted units of Alternative
Investment Fund (AIF) are categorised, at the 
discretion of the Bank, under HTM category for 
an initial period of three years and valued at cost 
during this period. Such investments are transferred 
to the AFS category after the said period of three 
years. Investments in AFS category are valued 
at NAV provided by the AIF based on its financial 
statements. At least once in a year, units are valued 
based on the latest audited financials (not older than 
18 months) of the AIF, if available, or at ` 1 per AIF 
as per the RBI guidelines. Provision on investments 
in the units of AIFs is made in accordance with the 
RBI guidelines.
Pass Through Certificates (PTCs) including Priority
Sector-PTCs are valued by using FIMMDA credit 
spread as applicable for the NBFC category, based 
on the credit rating of the respective PTC over 
the YTM rates for Government of India securities 
published by FBIL. 
Investments classified under HTM category are
carried at their acquisition cost and not marked to 
market. Any premium on acquisition is amortised 
over the remaining maturity period of the security on 
a constant yield-to-maturity basis. Such amortisation 
of premium is adjusted against interest income from 
investments. Any diminution, other than temporary, 
in the value of investments in HTM category is 
provided for.

SCHEDULES TO THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
As at March 31, 2024
Non-performing investments are identified and
provision are made thereon based on the RBI 
guidelines. The provision on such non-performing 
investments is not set off against the appreciation 
in respect of other performing investments. Interest 
on non-performing investments is not recognised 
until received.
2. Repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions
Repurchase (Repo) and reverse repurchase (Reverse 
Repo) transactions are reported as borrowing and 
lending (lending above 14 days tenor reported as 
advances) respectively. 
Borrowing cost on repo transactions is accounted as 
interest expense and revenue on reverse repo transactions 
is accounted as interest income.
3. Advances
 
Classification:
Advances are classified as performing and non-performing 
based on the RBI guidelines and are stated net of bills 
rediscounted, inter-bank participation with risk, specific 
loan loss provision, interest suspense for non-performing 
advances, claims received from Credit Guarantors, 
provision for funded interest term loan and provision for 
diminution in the fair value of restructured assets. 
 
Provisioning:
 The Bank classifies its loans and investments, including 
at overseas branches and overdues from crystallised 
derivative contracts, into performing and non-performing 
in accordance with RBI guidelines. Further the NPAs are 
classified into sub-standard, doubtful and loss assets 
based on the RBI guidelines. Non-performing assets are 
upgraded into standard as per the extant RBI guidelines.
Specific loan loss provision in respect of non-performing 
advances is made based on management’s assessment 
of the degree of impairment of advances, subject to the 
minimum provisioning prescribed by the RBI.
The specific loan loss provision for retail non-performing 
advances is also made based on the nature of product 
and delinquency levels.
Non-performing advances are written-off in accordance 
with the Bank’s policy. Recoveries from bad debts writtenoff are included under other income. 
Loans reported as frauds are classified as loss assets 
and fully provided for immediately without considering the 
value of security.
The Bank maintains general provision for standard assets 
including credit exposures computed as per the current 
marked to market values of interest rate and foreign 
exchange derivative contracts and gold. The Bank also 
maintains general provision for unhedged foreign currency 
exposures of borrowers, provision on loans to specific 
borrowers in specific stressed sectors, provision on 
exposures to step-down subsidiaries of Indian companies 
and provision on specified borrowers as prescribed by 
RBI. In the case of overseas branches, general provision 
on standard assets is maintained at the higher of the 
levels stipulated by the respective overseas regulator or 
RBI. The provision for standard assets is included under 
other liabilities.
In addition to the above, the Bank on a prudent basis 
makes provision on advances or exposures which are not 
NPAs, but has reasons to believe on the basis of the extant 
environment or specific information or basis regulatory 
guidance / instructions, of a possible slippage of a specific 
advance or a group of advances or exposures or potential 
exposures. These are classified as contingent provisions 
and included under other liabilities.
Provision made in addition to the Bank’s policy for specific 
loan loss provision for non-performing assets, possible 
slippage of specific exposures and regulatory general 
provision is categorised as floating provision. Creation of 
floating provision is considered by the Bank up to a level 
approved by the Board of Directors. Floating provisions 
are used only for contingencies under extraordinary 
circumstances and for making specific provisions for nonperforming accounts. Floating provisions are included 
under other liabilities.
Further to the provisions required to be held according 
to the asset classification status, provision is held for 
individual country exposures (other than for home country 
exposure). Countries are categorised into risk categories 
as per Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd. 
(‘ECGC’) guidelines and provisioning is made in respect 
of that country where the net funded exposure is one 
percent or more of the Bank’s total assets. Provision for 
country risk is included under other liabilities.
 In accordance with the RBI guidelines on the prudential 
framework for resolution of stressed assets and the 
HDFC Bank Limited
3 0 6

resolution frameworks for COVID-19 related stress and 
its Board approved policy, the Bank has implemented 
resolution plans for eligible borrowers. The asset 
classification and necessary provision thereon is made in 
accordance with the said RBI guidelines. The restructured 
loans are upgraded into standard category as per the 
extant RBI guidelines. Further, in respect of restructuring 
of loans pertaining to projects under implementation, the 
asset classification and necessary provision thereon is 
made in accordance with the said RBI guidelines.
Securitisation and transfer of assets
Assets transferred through securitisation and direct 
assignment of cash flows are de-recognised in the 
Balance Sheet when they are sold (true sale criteria 
being fully met with) and consideration is received. 
Sales / transfers that do not meet true sale criteria are 
accounted for as borrowings. For a securitisation or direct 
assignment transaction, the Bank recognises profit upon 
receipt of the funds and loss is recognised at the time 
of sale.
On sale of stressed assets, if the sale is at a price below 
the net book value (i.e., funded outstanding less specific 
provisions held), the shortfall is charged to the Profit and 
Loss Account and if the sale is for a value higher than 
the net book value, the excess provision is credited to 
the Profit and Loss Account in the year when the sum 
of cash received by way of initial consideration and / 
or redemption or transfer of security receipts issued by 
Securitisation Company (‘SC’) / Reconstruction Company 
(‘RC’) exceeds the net book value of the loan at the time 
of transfer.
In respect of stressed assets sold under an asset 
securitisation, where the investment by the bank in SRs 
issued against the assets transferred by it is more than 10 
percent of such SRs, provisions held against outstanding 
SRs are higher of the provisions required in terms of net 
asset value declared by the SC / RC and provisions 
as per the extant norms applicable to the underlying 
loans, notionally treating the book value of these SRs as 
the corresponding stressed loans assuming the loans 
remained in the books of the Bank.
The Bank invests in PTCs issued by Special Purpose 
Vehicles (SPVs). These are accounted at acquisition cost 
and are classified as investments. The Bank also buys 
loans through the direct assignment route which are 
classified as advances. PTCs are carried at acquisition 
cost unless it is more than the face value, in which case 
the premium is amortised based on effective interest 
rate method.
The Bank transfers advances through inter-bank 
participation with and without risk. In the case of 
participation with risk, the aggregate amount of the 
participation issued by the Bank is reduced from 
advances. In case where the Bank is assuming risk by 
participation, the aggregate amount of the participation 
is classified under advances. In the case of issue of 
participation certificate without risk, the aggregate amount 
of participation issued by the Bank is classified under 
borrowings and where the Bank is acquiring participation 
certificate, the aggregate amount of participation acquired 
is shown as due from banks under advances.
Fixed assets and depreciation
Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation as adjusted for impairment, if any. Cost 
includes cost of purchase and all expenditure like site 
preparation, installation costs and professional fees 
incurred on the asset before it is ready to use. Subsequent 
expenditure incurred on assets put to use is capitalised 
only when it increases the future benefit / functioning 
capability from / of such assets. 
Depreciation is charged over the estimated useful life 
of the fixed asset on a straight-line basis except for 
freehold land. The management believes that the useful 
life of assets assessed by the Bank, pursuant to Part C 
of Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013, taking into 
account changes in environment, changes in technology, 
the utility and efficacy of the asset in use, fairly reflects its 
estimate of useful lives of the fixed assets. The estimated 
useful lives of key fixed assets are given below:

and transfer to statutory reserve, are transferred to 
capital reserve.
Assets (other than PoS terminals) costing less than
` 5,000 individually, are fully depreciated in the year 
of purchase.
Non-Banking Assets
Non-Banking Assets (NBAs) acquired in satisfaction 
of claims are carried at lower of net book value or net 
realizable value.
Impairment of assets
The Bank assesses at each Balance Sheet date whether 
there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. 
Impairment loss, if any, is provided to the extent the 
carrying amount of assets exceeds their estimated 
recoverable amount.
Translation of foreign currency items
Foreign currency income and expenditure items of 
domestic operations are translated at the exchange 
rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Income 
and expenditure items of integral foreign operations 
(representative offices) are translated at the weekly 
average closing rates and of non-integral foreign 
operations (foreign branches and offshore banking units) 
at the monthly average closing rates.
Outstanding foreign currency monetary items of domestic 
and integral foreign operations are translated at the 
closing exchange rates notified by Foreign Exchange 
Dealers’ Association of India (FEDAI) as at the Balance 
Sheet date and the resulting net revaluation profit or loss 
is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account.
Both monetary and non-monetary foreign currency 
assets and liabilities of non-integral foreign operations 
are translated at closing exchange rates notified by FEDAI 
at the Balance Sheet date and the resulting profit / loss 
arising from exchange differences are accumulated in the 
Foreign Currency Translation Reserve until disposal of the 
non-integral foreign operations in accordance with AS - 
11, The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates 
and the extant RBI guidelines. 
Foreign currency denominated contingent liabilities on 
account of foreign exchange and derivative contracts, 
guarantees, letters of credit, acceptances and 
endorsements are translated at closing rates of exchange 
notified by FEDAI as at the Balance Sheet date.
Foreign exchange and derivative contracts
Foreign exchange spot and forward contracts, outstanding 
as at the Balance Sheet date and held for trading, are 
revalued at the closing spot and forward rates respectively 
as notified by FEDAI and at interpolated rates for contracts 
of interim maturities. The USD-INR exchange rate for 
valuation of contracts having longer maturities i.e. greater 
than one year, is derived using the USD-INR spot rate as 
well as relevant INR yield curve and USD yield curve. For 
other currency pairs, and non-deliverable contracts, the 
forward points (for rates / tenors not published by FEDAI) 
are obtained / derived basis data published by Refinitiv 
or Bloomberg for valuation of the contracts. Valuation is 
considered on present value basis. For this purpose, the 
forward profit or loss on the contracts are discounted 
to the valuation date using the discounting yields. The 
resulting profit or loss on valuation is recognised in the 
Profit and Loss Account. Marked to market value of 
foreign exchange contracts are classified as assets when 
the fair value is positive or as liabilities when the fair value 
is negative.
The Bank recognises all derivative contracts at fair value, 
on the date on which such derivative contracts are entered 
into and are re-measured at fair value as at the Balance 
Sheet date. Marked to market values of such derivatives 
HDFC Bank Limited
3 0 8

are classified as assets when the fair value is positive or 
as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
The Bank as part of its risk management strategy, makes 
use of derivative instruments, including foreign exchange 
forward contracts, for hedging the risk embedded in 
some of its financial assets or liabilities recognised on the 
balance sheet. The Bank identifies the hedged item (asset 
or liability) at the inception of the transaction itself. Hedge 
effectiveness is ascertained at the time of the inception 
of the hedge and at the reporting date thereafter.
Foreign exchange forward contracts and Principal only 
swaps (POS) not intended for trading, that are entered into 
to establish the amount of reporting currency required or 
available at the settlement date of a transaction, and are 
outstanding at the Balance Sheet date, are accounted in 
accordance with AS 11. Accordingly, such contracts are 
not marked to market and only translated at spot rate. 
The premium or discount arising at the inception of such 
forward exchange contract is amortised on a straight line 
basis as expense or income over the life of the contract. 
The interest income / expense on such POS transaction 
is accounted on accrual basis.
In case of a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair 
value of the hedging instruments and hedged items are 
recognised in the Profit and Loss Account and in case of 
cash flow hedges, the changes in fair value of effective 
portion are recognised in Reserves and Surplus under 
‘Cash flow hedge reserve’ and ineffective portion of an 
effective hedging relationship, if any, is recognised in 
the Profit and Loss Account. The accumulated balance 
in the cash flow hedge reserve, in an effective hedging 
relationship, is recycled in the Profit and Loss Account at 
the same time that the impact from the hedged item is 
recognised in the Profit and Loss Account.
In relation to derivative contracts with non-performing 
borrowers, the Bank makes provision for the entire amount 
of overdue and future receivables relating to positive 
marked to market value of the said derivative contracts.
10. Revenue recognition
Interest income is recognised in the Profit and Loss 
Account on an accrual basis, except in the case of nonperforming assets which is recognised when realised.
Interest income on investments in PTCs and loans bought 
out through the direct assignment route is recognised at 
their effective interest rate. 
Income on non-coupon bearing discounted instruments is 
recognised over the tenor of the instrument on a constant 
yield basis.
Dividend on equity shares and preference shares is 
recognised as income when the right to receive the dividend is established.
Income from units of mutual funds / AIF is recognised on 
cash basis.
Loan processing fee is recognised as income when due. 
Syndication / Arranger fee is recognised as income when 
a significant act / milestone is completed.
Gain / loss on sell down of loans is recognised in line with 
the extant RBI guidelines.
Guarantee commission, commission on letter of credit, 
annual locker rent fees and annual fees for credit cards 
are recognised on a straight-line basis over the period 
of contract. Other fees and commission income are 
recognised when due, where the Bank is reasonably 
certain of ultimate collection.
Fees paid / received for priority sector lending certificates 
(PSLC) is recognised on straight-line basis over the period 
of the certificate.
11. Employee benefits
Stock based Employee Compensation:
The Employee Stock Option Scheme (‘the Scheme’) 
provides for the grant of options to acquire equity shares 
of the Bank to its employees and whole time directors. 
The Employee Stock Incentive Master Scheme -2022 
(ESIS-2022) provides for the grant of Restricted Stock 
Units (units) to acquire equity shares of the Bank to its 
employees and whole-time directors. The options / units 
granted shall vest as per their vesting schedule and these 
may be exercised within a specified period. 
The Bank followed the intrinsic value method to account for 
its stock-based employee compensation plans in respect 
of options granted up to March 31, 2021. Compensation 
cost was measured by the excess, if any, of the market 
price of the underlying stock over the exercise price as 
determined under the option plan. The market price is 
the closing price on the stock exchange where there is 
highest trading volume on the working day immediately 
preceding the date of grant.

SCHEDULES TO THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
As at March 31, 2024
Effective April 01, 2021, the fair value of share-linked 
instruments on the date of grant for all instruments granted 
after March 31, 2021 is recognised as an expense in 
accordance with the RBI guidelines on Compensation of 
Whole Time Directors / Chief Executive Officers / Material 
Risk Takers and Control Function staff. The fair value of 
the stock-based employee compensation is estimated on 
the date of grant using Black-Scholes model. 
The compensation cost is amortised on a straight-line 
basis over the vesting period after adjusting estimated 
forfeiture. Ultimately, the cost for all instruments that vest is 
recognised. The compensation expense is recognised in 
the Profit and Loss Account with a corresponding credit to 
Employee Stock Options Outstanding. On exercise of the 
stock options, corresponding balance in Employee Stock 
Options Outstanding is transferred to Share Premium. 
In respect of the options which expire unexercised, the 
balance standing to the credit of Employee Stock Options 
Outstanding is transferred to General Reserve.
 
Gratuity:
The Bank has an obligation towards gratuity, a defined 
benefit retirement plan covering all eligible employees. 
The plan benefit vests upon completion of minimum 
prescribed period of continuous years of service and 
is in the form of lump sum amount, without an upper 
limit, equivalent to 15 days’ basic salary payable for 
each completed year of service to all eligible employees, 
except in respect of employees of eHDFC Limited, where 
the vesting is equivalent to one month’s basic salary for 
each completed year of service till the effective date 
of amalgamation, on resignation, retirement or death 
while in employment or on termination of employment. 
The Bank makes contributions to a recognised Gratuity 
Trust administered by trustees and whose funds are 
managed by insurance companies. In respect of erstwhile 
Lord Krishna Bank (eLKB) employees, the Bank makes 
contribution to a fund set up by eLKB and administered by 
the Board of Trustees. The defined gratuity benefit plans 
are valued by an independent actuary as at the Balance 
Sheet date using the projected unit credit method as per 
the requirement of AS-15, Employee Benefits, to determine 
the present value of the defined benefit obligation and the 
related service costs. The actuarial calculations entails 
assumptions about demographics, early retirement, 
salary increases and interest rates. Actuarial gain or loss 
is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account.
 
Superannuation:
The Bank has a Superannuation Plan under which 
employees of the Bank, above a prescribed grade, are 
entitled to receive retirement benefits either through salary 
or under a defined contribution plan. For those opting for 
a defined contribution plan, the Bank contributes a sum 
equivalent to 13% of the employee’s eligible annual basic 
salary (15% for the whole time directors and for certain 
eligible employees of the erstwhile Centurion Bank of 
Punjab (eCBoP staff) to a Trust administered by trustees 
and whose funds are managed by insurance companies. 
The Bank has no liability towards future superannuation 
fund benefits other than its contribution and recognises 
such contribution as an expense in the year incurred.
Provident fund:
The Bank is covered under the Employees Provident Fund 
and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 and accordingly 
all employees of the Bank are entitled to receive benefits 
under the provident fund. The Bank contributes an amount, 
on a monthly basis, at a determined rate (currently 12% 
of employee’s basic salary). Of this, the Bank contributes 
an amount equal to 8.33% of employee’s basic salary 
up to a maximum salary level of ` 15,000/- per month, 
to the Pension Scheme administered by the Regional 
Provident Fund Office. The balance amount out of the 
12% employer’s share is contributed to an exempted Trust 
set up by the Bank and administered by the Board of 
Trustees. The Bank recognises such contributions as an 
expense in the year in which it is incurred. 
Interest payable to the members of the exempted trust 
shall not be lower than the statutory rate of interest 
declared by the Central Government under the Employees 
Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 
and shortfall, if any, shall be made good by the Bank.
The guidance note on implementing AS-15, Employee 
Benefits, states that benefits involving employer 
established provident funds, which require interest 
shortfalls to be provided, are to be considered as defined 
benefit plan. Actuarial valuation of this Provident Fund 
interest shortfall is done as per the guidance note issued 
in this respect by The Institute of Actuaries of India (IAI) 
and provision towards this liability is made.
The overseas branches of the Bank make contribution 
to the respective applicable government social security 
scheme calculated as a percentage of the employees’ 
salaries. The Bank’s obligations are limited to these 
HDFC Bank Limited
3 10

contributions, which are expensed when due, as such 
contribution is in the nature of defined contribution.
 
Pension:
In respect of pension payable to certain eLKB employees 
under the Lord Krishna Bank (Employees) Pension 
Scheme, which is a defined benefit scheme, the Bank 
contributes 10% of basic salary to a pension trust set up 
by the Bank and administered by the Board of Trustees 
and an additional amount towards the liability shortfall 
based on an independent actuarial valuation as at the 
Balance Sheet date, which includes assumptions about 
demographics, early retirement, salary increases and 
interest rates.
In respect of certain eLKB employees who had moved to 
a Cost to Company (CTC) based compensation structure 
and had completed less than 15 years of service, the 
contribution which was made until then, is maintained as 
a fund and will be converted into annuity on separation 
after a lock-in-period of two years. For this category 
of employees, liability stands frozen and no additional 
provision is required except for interest as applicable to 
Provident Fund, which is provided for.
In respect of certain eLKB employees who moved to 
a CTC structure and had completed service of more 
than 15 years, pension would be paid on separation 
based on salary applicable as on the date of movement 
to CTC structure. Provision thereto is made based on 
an independent actuarial valuation as at the Balance 
Sheet date.
National Pension Scheme (NPS):
In respect of employees who opt for contribution to the 
NPS, the Bank contributes certain percentage of the basic 
salary of employees to the aforesaid scheme, a defined 
contribution plan, which is managed and administered 
by pension fund management companies. The Bank has 
no liability other than its contribution and recognises such 
contributions as an expense in the year incurred.
12. Debit and credit cards reward points
The Bank estimates the probable redemption of debit 
and credit card reward points and cost per point using an 
actuarial method by employing an independent actuary, 
which includes assumptions such as discount rate, block, 
withdrawal, cost per reward point, mortality, redemption 
and spends. Provisions for liabilities on the outstanding 
reward points are made based on an independent 
actuarial valuation as at the Balance Sheet date and 
included in other liabilities and provisions.
13. Bullion
The Bank imports bullion including precious metal bars on 
a consignment basis. The imports are typically on a backto-back basis and are priced to the customer based on 
the price quoted by the supplier. The difference between 
the price recovered from customers and cost of bullion 
is accounted at the time of sale to the customers and 
reported as ‘‘Other Income’’.
The Bank also deals in bullion on a borrowing and lending 
basis and the interest thereon is accounted as interest 
expense / income respectively.
14. Segment information
The disclosure relating to segment information is in 
accordance with AS-17, Segment Reporting and as per 
guidelines issued by RBI.
15. Lease accounting
Lease payments including cost escalation for assets 
taken on operating lease are recognised as expense in 
the Profit and Loss Account over the lease term on a 
straight-line basis in accordance with the AS-19, Leases.
16. Earnings per share
The Bank reports basic and diluted earnings per equity 
share in accordance with AS-20, Earnings per Share. 
Basic earnings per equity share has been computed 
by dividing net profit for the year attributable to equity 
shareholders by the weighted average number of equity 
shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings 
per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur 
if securities or other contracts to issue equity shares 
were exercised or converted to equity during the year. 
Diluted earnings per equity share are computed using 
the weighted average number of equity shares and the 
dilutive potential equity shares outstanding during the 
period except where the results are anti-dilutive. 
17. Income tax
Income tax expense comprises current tax provision (i.e. 
the amount of tax for the period determined in accordance 
with the Income Tax Act, 1961, the rules framed there 
under and considering the material principles set out in 
Income Computation and Disclosure Standards) and the

SCHEDULES TO THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
As at March 31, 2024
net change in the deferred tax asset or liability during the 
year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised 
for the future tax consequences of timing differences 
between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and 
their respective tax bases, and operating loss carried 
forward, if any. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
measured using the enacted or substantively enacted 
tax rates as at the Balance Sheet date. 
Current tax assets and liabilities and deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are off-set when they relate to income taxes 
levied by the same taxation authority, when the Bank has 
a legal right to off-set and when the Bank intends to settle 
on a net basis.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent there 
is reasonable certainty that the assets can be realised 
in future. In case of unabsorbed depreciation or carried 
forward loss under taxation laws, deferred tax assets are 
recognised only if there is virtual certainty of realisation 
of such assets. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at 
each Balance Sheet date and appropriately adjusted to 
reflect the amount that is reasonably / virtually certain to 
be realised.
18. Accounting for provisions, contingent liabilities
and contingent assets
In accordance with AS-29, “Provisions, Contingent 
Liabilities and Contingent Assets”, the Bank recognises 
provisions when it has a present obligation as a result of 
a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources 
embodying economic benefits will be required to settle 
the obligation and when a reliable estimate of the amount 
of the obligation can be made. 
Provisions are determined based on management estimate 
required to settle the obligation at the Balance Sheet date, 
supplemented by experience of similar transactions. 
These are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and 
adjusted to reflect the current management estimates.
A disclosure of contingent liability is made when there is:
a possible obligation arising from a past event,
the existence of which will be confirmed by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more 
uncertain future events not within the control of the 
Bank; or
a present obligation arising from a past event which
is not recognised as it is not probable that an outflow 
of resources will be required to settle the obligation 
or a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation 
cannot be made.
When there is a possible obligation or a present obligation 
in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of resources 
is remote, no provision or disclosure is made.
Contingent assets, if any, are not recognised in the 
financial statements since this may result in the recognition 
of income that may never be realised.
19. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash, gold in 
hand, rupee digital currency with RBI, balances with 
RBI, balances with other banks and money at call and 
short notice.
20. Share issue expenses
Share issue expenses are adjusted against Share 
Premium Account in terms of Section 52 of the Companies 
Act, 2013.
21. Corporate social responsibility
Expenditure towards corporate social responsibility, in 
accordance with Companies Act, 2013, is recognised in 
the Profit and Loss Account.

SCHEDULE 18 - Schedules forming part of the standalone financial statements for the year ended 
March 31, 2024
Amounts in notes forming part of the standalone financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 are denominated in 
rupee crore to conform to extant RBI guidelines, except where stated otherwise.
Amalgamation of HDFC Limited
The Board of Directors at its meeting held on April 04, 2022, approved a composite Scheme of amalgamation (“Scheme”), 
for the amalgamation of: (i) erstwhile HDFC Investments Limited (“eHDFC Investments”) and erstwhile HDFC Holdings 
Limited (“eHDFC Holdings”), with and into erstwhile Housing Development Finance Corporation Limited (“eHDFC Limited”); 
and thereafter (ii) eHDFC Limited into HDFC Bank Limited (“Bank”), and their respective shareholders and creditors, under 
Sections 230 to 232 of the Companies Act, 2013 and other applicable laws including the rules and regulations. The Scheme 
was approved by the shareholders at the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) convened meeting of the shareholders 
of the Bank held on November 25, 2022. The NCLT, in accordance with Sections 230 to 232 of the Companies Act, 2013 
and rules thereunder, vide its order dated March 17, 2023 sanctioned the Scheme. Upon receipt of all requisite approvals, 
the Bank filed form INC 28 with Registrar of Companies on July 01, 2023 and accordingly, the scheme became effective 
on July 01, 2023. As per the Scheme, the appointed date for the amalgamation of eHDFC Limited with and into the Bank 
is the same as effective date of the Scheme i.e. July 01, 2023. The Profit and Loss Account for the year ended March 31, 
2024 include the operations of eHDFC Limited, eHDFC Investments and eHDFC Holdings for the period from July 01, 2023 
to March 31, 2024 and the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2024 includes the balances transferred from eHDFC Limited and 
hence are not comparable with the previous year.
The amalgamation has been accounted under the ‘pooling of interest’ method as prescribed in Accounting Standard-14 
“Accounting for amalgamation” (“AS-14”). Outstanding balances between eHDFC Limited and the Bank were eliminated as 
on July 01, 2023. All assets and liabilities of eHDFC Limited have been recognised by the Bank at their carrying amounts 
as on that date except for adjustments to bring about uniformity of accounting policies as required under AS-14. The share 
capital of ` 311.04 crore issued by the Bank as consideration pursuant to the scheme has been adjusted against the 
corresponding share capital of eHDFC Limited of ` 370.29 crore and the difference has been adjusted to Amalgamation 
Reserve. Further, excess of cost over face value of Investment in shares of the Bank by eHDFC Limited of ` 14,006.31 crore 
has been adjusted to Amalgamation Reserve. Consequently, the Bank has recognised a debit balance of ` 13,947.06 crore 
in the Amalgamation Reserve as a result of these adjustments. The Bank has sought approval from the RBI to set-off the 
debit balance in Amalgamation Reserve by appropriating profit for the financial year ended March 31, 2024.

Consequent upon amalgamation becoming effective, the authorised share capital of the Bank stood increased to ` 1,190.61 
crore (11,90,61,00,000 shares of ` 1/- each) on account of transfer to and amalgamation / combination of authorised capital 
of eHDFC Limited with the authorised share capital of the Bank. In terms of the Scheme, the Bank has issued and allotted 
3,11,03,96,492 equity shares to the shareholders of eHDFC Limited as on July 13, 2023, being the record date fixed by the 
Board of Directors as per the Scheme, in accordance with the share exchange ratio i.e. 42 equity shares of face value of 
` 1/- each of the Bank for every 25 equity shares of face value of ` 2/- each of eHDFC Limited. Accordingly, the paid-up 
share capital of the Bank increased from ` 559.18 crore consisting of 5,59,17,98,806 equity shares of ` 1/- each to ` 753.76 
crore consisting of 7,53,75,69,464 equity shares of ` 1/- each, post cancellation of 1,16,46,25,834 equity shares held by 
eHDFC Limited in the Bank on that date in accordance with the provisions of the Scheme.
In relation to the Scheme, the Bank had made applications to the RBI seeking certain forbearances / glidepath to commence 
from the effective date of the amalgamation. The applications were submitted to the RBI keeping in mind that the merged 
entity including its subsidiaries would require to comply with the extant RBI regulations with the expectation of facilitating 
minimal disruption to the existing customers of the merged entity, providing smooth glidepath and enabling the merged 
entity to continue with the incremental flow of credit in the economy including priority sector. The RBI has granted certain 
forbearances / glidepath and provided clarifications to the Bank by subsequent communications, the effect of which has 
been incorporated in the standalone financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024. The Bank continues to engage 
with the RBI in this regard.
As part of the Scheme, certain leased out immovable properties of eHDFC Limited were transferred to the Bank on 
amalgamation. The Bank has initiated necessary steps to foreclose these leases.
Proposed dividend
The Board of Directors at its meeting held on April 20, 2024 proposed a dividend of ` 19.50 per equity share (previous year: 
` 19.00 per equity share) aggregating to `14,813.98 crore subject to the approval of shareholders at the ensuing Annual 
General Meeting. During the year ended March 31, 2024, the dividend paid by the Bank in respect of the previous year 
ended March 31, 2023 was ` 8,404.42 crore. No dividend was paid in respect of equity shares that were cancelled upon 
the Scheme becoming effective. In terms of the AS-4 “Contingencies and events occurring after the balance sheet date”, 
the Bank has not appropriated the proposed dividend from the Profit and Loss Account and the same will be recognised 
in the year of actual payout post approval. However, effect of the proposed dividend has been reckoned in determining 
capital funds in computation of the capital adequacy ratio.
Capital adequacy
The Bank’s capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (‘Capital Adequacy Ratio’) is calculated in accordance with the RBI guidelines 
on Basel III capital regulations (‘Basel III’). The minimum capital ratio requirement under Basel III as at March 31, 2024 and 
March 31, 2023 is as follows:

Whole Time Directors, Equity Stock Options (‘ESOPs’) or Restricted Stock Units (‘Units’) each of which is convertible into 
one equity share. Further, pursuant to the amalgamation of eHDFC Limited with and into Bank effective from July 01, 2023, 
the existing ESOP Schemes of the eHDFC Limited comprising of eHDFC 2007, eHDFC 2008, eHDFC 2014, eHDFC 2017

closing price is the closing price of the Bank’s equity share on an Indian stock exchange with the highest trading volume

each. The vesting conditions applicable to the options / units are at the discretion of the NRC. These options / units are 
exercisable on vesting, for a period as set forth by the NRC at the time of the grant. The period in which the options and 
units may be exercised cannot exceed five years and one year respectively from the date of expiry of vesting period.

Qualitative disclosure on LCR
The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) is one of the Basel Committee’s key reforms to develop a more resilient banking sector. 
The objective of the LCR is to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banks. It does this by ensuring 
that banks have an adequate stock of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) that can be converted easily and 
immediately into cash to meet their liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario. The LCR is expected to 
improve the banking sector’s ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress, whatever the source, 
thus reducing the risk of spillover from the financial sector to the real economy.
The Liquidity Risk Management of the Bank is governed by the Asset Liability Management (ALM) Policy approved by the 
Board. The Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) is a decision-making unit responsible for implementing the liquidity and interest 
rate risk management strategy of the Bank in line with its risk management objectives and ensures adherence to the risk 
tolerance / limits set by the Board. The Bank has also set up a senior level management committee, viz., the Group Risk 
Management Committee (GRMC) under the ICAAP framework of the Bank, to establish a formal and dedicated structure 
to periodically assess the nature / quantum of material risks of the subsidiaries and adequacy of its risk management 
processes, including providing oversight for managing liquidity risk. Liquidity for the Bank’s domestic banking operations 
is directly managed at the Head Office. The overseas branches and offshore unit of the Bank independently manage their 
liquidity requirements with support from the Head Office. Similarly, the Bank’s subsidiaries independently manage their 
liquidity requirements under guidance of the GRMC, which, along with senior management of the subsidiaries, reviews 
the risk assessment of material risks at the subsidiaries. Further, the Bank maintains suitable systems and processes to 
monitor liquidity requirements in other currencies as appropriate.
In order to determine cash outflows, the Bank segregates its deposits into various customer segments, viz., Retail (which 
include deposits from individuals), Small Business Customers (those with deposits upto ` 7.5 crore), and Wholesale (which 
would cover all residual deposits). Other contractual funding, including a portion of other liabilities which are expected to run 
down in a 30 day time frame are included in the cash outflows. These classifications, based on extant regulatory guidelines, 
are part of the Bank’s LCR framework, and are also submitted to the RBI.
The LCR is calculated by dividing a Bank’s stock of HQLA by its total net cash outflows over a 30 day stress period. The 
present minimum requirement, as on March 31, 2024 is 100%.
In the Indian context, the run-off factors for the stressed scenarios are prescribed by the RBI, for various categories 
of liabilities (viz., deposits, unsecured and secured wholesale borrowings), undrawn commitments, derivative-related 
exposures, and offset with inflows emanating from assets maturing within the same time period. Given below is a table of 
run-off factors and the average LCR maintained by the Bank quarter-wise over the past two years:

The average LCR for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 was at 114.73% as against 114.85% for the quarter ended March 
31, 2023, and above the present prescribed minimum requirement of 100%. The average HQLA for the quarter ended 
March 31, 2024 was ` 558,424.94 crore, as against ` 442,566.92 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. During 
the same period the composition of government securities and treasury bills in the HQLA was at 95.74% as compared to 
89.95% in the previous year.
For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, derivative exposures (net of cash inflows) / collateral requirements and undrawn 
commitments constituted just about 0.59% and 1.54% respectively of average cash outflow as against 0.67% and 2.78% 
respectively for quarter ended March 31, 2023. The Bank has a significant portion of funding through deposits. As of 
March 31, 2024 the top 20 depositors comprised of 3.33% of total deposits indicating a healthy and stable deposit profile.

Divergence in the asset classification and provisioning
In terms of the RBI guidelines, banks are required to disclose the divergence in asset classification and provisioning 
consequent to RBI’s annual supervisory process in their notes to accounts to the financial statements, wherever the 
additional provisioning assessed / additional gross NPAs identified by RBI exceeds the threshold specified by RBI. 
The threshold for provisioning is 5 per cent (Previous year: 10 per cent) of the reported profit before provisions and 
contingencies for the reference period and that for additional gross NPAs is 5 per cent (Previous year: 10 per cent) of 
the published incremental Gross NPAs for the reference period.
Based on the above, there was no reportable divergence in asset classification and provisioning for NPAs for the years 
ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022.

Unhedged foreign currency exposure
The Bank has in place a policy and process for managing currency induced credit risk. The credit appraisal 
memorandum prepared at the time of origination and review of a credit facility is required to discuss the exchange 
risk that the customer is exposed to from all sources, including trade related, foreign currency borrowings and external 
commercial borrowings. It could cover the natural hedge available to the customer as well as other hedging methods 
adopted by the customer to mitigate exchange risk. For foreign currency loans granted by the Bank beyond a defined 
threshold the customer is encouraged to enter into appropriate risk hedging mechanisms with the Bank. Alternatively, 
the Bank satisfies itself that the customer has the financial capacity to bear the exchange risk in the normal course of 
its business and / or has other mitigants to reduce the risk. On a periodic basis, the Bank reviews information on the 
unhedged portion of foreign currency exposures of customers, whose total foreign currency exposure with the Bank 
exceeds a defined threshold. A Board approved credit risk rating linked limit on unhedged foreign currency position 
of customers is applicable when extending credit facilities to a customer. The compliance with the limit is assessed

Overview of business and processes
Derivatives are financial instruments whose characteristics are derived from underlying assets, or from interest rates, 
exchange rates or indices. These include forwards, swaps, futures and options. The notional amounts of financial 
instruments such as foreign exchange contracts and derivatives provide a basis for comparison with the instruments 
recognised on the Balance Sheet but do not necessarily indicate the amounts of future cash flows involved or the 
current fair value of the instruments and, therefore, do not indicate the Bank’s exposure to credit or price risks. The 
following sections outline the nature and terms of the derivative transactions generally undertaken by the Bank.

SCHEDULES TO THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended March 31, 2024
Interest rate contracts
Forward rate agreements give the buyer the ability to determine the underlying rate of interest for a specified period 
commencing on a specified future date (the settlement date). The underlying rate of interest could be an interest rate 
curve, interest rate index or bond yield. There is no exchange of principal and settlement is effected on the settlement 
date. The settlement amount is the difference between the contracted rate and the market rate prevailing on the 
settlement date discounted for the interest period of the agreement.
Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of interest obligations with the counterparty for a specified period without 
exchanging the underlying (or notional) principal.
Interest rate caps and floors give the buyer the ability to fix the maximum or minimum rate of interest. The writer of 
the contract pays the amount by which the market rate exceeds or is less than the cap rate or the floor rate respectively. 
A combination of interest rate caps and floors can create structures such as interest rate collar, cap spreads and 
floor spreads. 
Interest rate futures are standardised interest rate derivative contracts traded on a recognised stock exchange to 
buy or sell a notional security or any other interest bearing instrument or an index of such instruments or interest rates 
at a specified future date, at a price determined at the time of the contract.
Exchange rate contracts
Forward foreign exchange contracts are agreements to buy or sell fixed amounts of currency at an agreed 
exchange rate on a future date. These instruments are carried at fair value, determined based on either FEDAI rates 
or market quotations.
Cross currency swaps are agreements to exchange principal amounts denominated in different currencies. Cross 
currency swaps may also involve the exchange of interest payments on one specified currency for interest payments 
in another specified currency for a specified period.
Currency options (including Exchange Traded Currency Option) give the buyer, on payment of a premium, 
the right but not an obligation, to buy or sell specified amounts of currency at an agreed exchange rate on or before 
a specified future date. 
Currency futures contract is a standardised contract traded on an exchange, to buy or sell a certain underlying 
currency on a certain date in the future, at a specified price. The contract specifies the rate of exchange between one 
unit of currency with another.
The Bank’s derivative transactions relate to sales and trading activities. Sale activities include the structuring and 
marketing of derivatives to customers to enable them to hedge their market risks (both interest rate and exchange 
risks), within the regulatory framework as applicable from time to time. The Bank deals in derivatives on its own 
account (trading activity) principally for the purpose of generating a profit from short term fluctuations in price yields or 
implied volatility. The Bank also deals in derivatives to hedge the risk embedded in some of its Balance Sheet assets 
or liabilities.
Constituents involved in derivative business
The Treasury front-office enters into derivative transactions with customers and inter-bank counterparties. The Bank 
has an independent back-office and mid-office as per regulatory guidelines. The Bank has credit risk and market risk 
departments, as part of the Risk Management Group, that assesses counterparty credit risk and market risk limits, 
within the risk architecture and processes of the Bank.
HDFC Bank Limited

Derivative policy
The Bank has in place a Derivative policy which covers various aspects that apply to the functioning of the derivative 
business. The derivative business is administered through various market risk limits such as position limits, tenor 
limits, sensitivity limits, scenario based profit and loss limit for option portfolio, stop loss trigger levels and value-atrisk limits that are recommended by the Risk Policy and Monitoring Committee (‘RPMC’) to the Board of Directors for 
approval. All methodologies that are used to assess market and credit risks for derivative transactions are specified 
by the market risk and credit risk units. Limits are monitored on a daily basis by the mid-office.
The Bank has a Board approved policy on Customer Suitability & Appropriateness, which forms part of the Derivative 
policy, to ensure that derivative transactions entered into are appropriate and suitable to the customer’s nature of 
business / operations. Before entering into a derivative deal with a customer, the Bank scores the customer on various 
risk parameters and based on the overall score level it determines the kind of product that best suits its risk appetite 
and the customer’s requirements.
Classification of derivatives book
The derivative book is classified into trading and hedging book. Classification of the derivative book is made on the 
basis of the definitions of the trading and hedging specified in the RBI guidelines. The trading book is managed within 
the trading limits recommended by the RPMC and approved by the Board of Directors.
Hedging policy
For derivative contracts designated as hedging instruments, the Bank documents, at inception of the hedge, the 
relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, the risk management objective for undertaking the 
hedge and the methods used to assess the hedge effectiveness. Hedge effectiveness is ascertained at the time of 
inception of the hedge and periodically thereafter. Hedge effectiveness is measured by the degree to which changes 
in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item that are attributable to a hedged risk are offset by changes in the fair 
value or cash flows of the hedging instrument using various qualitative and quantitative methods.
The hedging book consists of transactions to hedge Balance Sheet assets or liabilities. The tenor of hedging instrument 
may be less than or equal to the tenor of underlying hedged asset or liability. The Bank as part of its risk management 
strategy, makes use of derivative instruments, including foreign exchange forward contracts, for hedging the risk 
embedded in some of its financial assets or liabilities recognised on the Balance Sheet. In case of a fair value hedge, 
the changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments and hedged items are recognised in the Profit and Loss 
Account and in case of cash flow hedges other than for foreign exchange forward contracts and principal only swaps, 
the changes in fair value of effective portion are recognised in Reserves and Surplus under ‘Cash flow hedge reserve’ 
and ineffective portion of an effective hedging relationship, if any, is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account. The 
accumulated balance in the cash flow hedge reserve, in an effective hedging relationship, is recycled in the Profit and 
Loss Account at the same time that the impact from the hedged item is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account. 
Foreign exchange forward contracts and principal only swaps not intended for trading, that are entered into to establish 
the amount of reporting currency required or available at the settlement date of a transaction, and are outstanding 
at the Balance Sheet date, are accounted in accordance with AS 11. Accordingly, such contracts are not marked to 
market and only translated at spot rate. The premia or discount arising at the inception of such forward exchange 
contract is amortised as expense or income over the life of the contract. The interest income / expense on such POS 
transaction is accounted on accrual basis.
Provisioning, collateral and credit risk mitigation
The Bank enters into derivative transactions with counterparties based on their business ranking and financial 
position. The Bank sets up appropriate appetite / limits upon evaluating the ability of the counterparty to honour its

obligations in the event of crystallisation of the exposure. Appropriate credit covenants are stipulated where required, 
as trigger events to call for collaterals or terminate a transaction and contain the risk. Further, to mitigate the current 
exposure in non-centrally cleared forex and derivative transactions, Bank has entered into Credit Support Annex 
(‘CSA’) agreements with some of the major international counterparty banks and few Indian financial institutions.
The Bank, at the minimum, conforms to the RBI guidelines with regard to provisioning requirements. Overdue 
receivables representing crystallised positive mark to market value of a derivative contract are transferred to the 
account of the borrower and treated as non-performing assets, if these remain unpaid for 90 days or more. Full 
provision is made for the entire amount of overdue and future receivables relating to positive marked to market value 
of non-performing derivative contracts.

The notional principal amounts of derivatives reflect the volume of transactions outstanding as at the Balance
Sheet date and do not represent the amounts at risk.
For the purpose of this disclosure; currency derivatives include currency options purchased and sold and cross
currency swaps; forward contracts include foreign exchange spot, forward and swap contracts; interest rate 
derivatives include interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and interest rate caps and floors.
The Bank has computed the maximum and minimum of PV01 for the year based on the balances as at the end
of every month.
In respect of derivative contracts, the Bank has computed the exposure under the Current Exposure Method
for counterparty credit risk capital computation based on the guidelines issued by RBI on “Bilateral Netting of 
Qualified Financial Contracts - Amendments to Prudential Guidelines” dated March 30, 2021 and any related 
amendments thereafter. However, for the purpose of calculating product-wise derivative exposure as mentioned 
in point number 3 in table above, bank has calculated using Current Exposure Method (‘CEM’) without the impact 
of Bilateral Netting.

the compensation is adjusted for all types of prudent risk taking;
(b) 
compensation outcomes are symmetric with risk outcomes;
(c) 
compensation payouts are sensitive to the time horizon of risk; and

Review of Remuneration Policy of the Bank
The Remuneration Policy of the Bank was reviewed by the NRC during the year ended March 31, 2024 and 
changes were made to the policy in accordance with the observations of the NRC .
II. 
Design and Structure of Remuneration
The design and structure of remuneration in accordance with the RBI guidelines dated November 04, 2019, for 
the financial year ended March 31, 2024, is as follows::
Fixed Pay
The Remuneration Policy ensures that the fixed component of the compensation is reasonable, taking into 
account all relevant factors including industry practice. 
Elements of Fixed Pay:
The fixed pay component of the Bank’s compensation structure typically consists of elements such as base 
salary, allowances, perquisites and retirement benefits. Perquisites extended are in the nature of company 
car, company leased accommodation, club membership and such other benefits or allowances in lieu of 
such perquisites / benefits. Retirement benefits include contributions to Provident Fund, Superannuation

provides pension to certain employees of the erstwhile Lord Krishna Bank (eLKB) under the Indian Banks’ 
Association (‘IBA’) structure.
HDFC Bank Limited

Determinants of Fixed Pay:
The fixed pay is primarily determined by taking into account factors such as the job size, performance, 
experience, location, market competitiveness of pay and is designed to meet the following key objectives of:
(a) 
fair compensation given the role complexity and size;
(b) fair compensation given the individual’s skill, competence, experience and market pay position;
(c) 
contribution to post retirement benefits; and
(d) compliance with all statutory obligations.
The quantum of fixed pay for the Senior Management i.e. Employees in Executive Vice President and above 
grades, Material Risk Takers other than Wholetime Directors, Risk and Control Staff and Key Management 
Personnel are approved by the NRC and the Board. 
The quantum of fixed pay for Whole Time Directors is approved by the NRC and the Board, and is subject 
to the approval of the RBI.
Variable Pay - For Senior Management and Material Risk Takers
The performance management system forms the basis for variable pay allocation of the Bank. The 
Remuneration Policy of the Bank ensures that the performance management system is comprehensive 
and considers both, quantitative and qualitative performance measures. 
(i) 
Composition of Variable pay
The variable pay will be in the form of share linked instruments or a mix of cash and share linked 
instruments. The share linked instrument used in the financial year 2023-24 was the Employee Stock 
Options. All plans for grant of options are framed in accordance with the SEBI guidelines, 1999 as 
amended from time to time and are approved by the shareholders of the Bank. These plans provide for 
the grant of options post approval by the NRC. For Wholetime Directors the variable pay is approved 
by the NRC, Board and the Reserve Bank of India.
The Bank will ensure that there is a proper balance between Fixed Pay and Variable Pay. In cases 
where compensation by way of share-linked instruments is not permitted by law / regulations, the entire 
variable pay will be in cash. 
(ii) Limits on Variable pay
A substantial portion of compensation i.e. at least 50% will be variable and paid on the basis of 
individual, business-unit and organization performance. This will be in line with the principle that, at 
higher levels of responsibility, the proportion of variable pay will be higher. The total variable pay shall 
be limited to a maximum of 300% of the fixed pay (for the relative performance period)
In case the variable pay is upto 200% of the fixed pay, a minimum of 50% of the variable pay; and in 
case the variable pay is above 200%, a minimum of 67% of the variable pay shall be via non-cash 
instruments. The non-cash component in 2023-24 comprised of Employee Stock Options.
In the event that the employee is barred by statute or regulation from grant of share-linked instruments, 
his / her variable pay will be capped at 150% of fixed pay but shall not be less than 50% of the fixed pay.

For the year ended March 31, 2024
(iii) Deferral of Variable pay
For senior management including Wholetime Directors (WTDs) and Material Risk Takers (MRTs), 
deferral arrangements exists for the variable pay. A minimum of 60% of total variable pay is under 
deferral arrangements. If cash component is a part of the variable pay, at least 50% of the cash bonus 
is deferred. In cases where cash component of the bonus is under Rs 25 lakh, deferral arrangements 
is not necessary.
The deferral period is a minimum of three years and is applicable to both cash and non-cash 
components of variable pay. The deferral period for share linked instruments / ESOPs is governed by 
the ESOP Scheme Rules which is approved by the NRC and the Board. In 2023-24, the deferment of 
cash variable pay, where applicable, was 3 years in the case of cash variable pay and 4 years (vesting 
period) in the case of Employee Stock Options.
(iv) Vesting of Variable pay
The deferred portion of the remuneration vests at the end of deferral period and is spread out over 
the course of the deferral period. The first vesting is not before one year from the commencement of 
the deferral period. The vesting is no faster than on a pro rata basis and the frequency of the vesting 
is more than a year in order to ensure appropriate assessment of risk. 
(v) Malus / Clawback Arrangement:
The Bank believes in sustained business performance in tandem with prudent risk taking. The Bank, 
therefore, has devised appropriate deterrents in order to institutionalize the aforementioned commitment.
Malus Arrangement: The provision of a Malus arrangement would entail cancellation of payout 
for the deferred portion of reward (cash variable pay / long term incentive (LTI) i.e. any Share Linked 
Instrument). The RBI guidelines define malus thus “A malus arrangement permits the bank to prevent 
vesting of all or part of the amount of a deferred remuneration. Malus arrangement does not reverse 
vesting after it has already occurred.”
Clawback Arrangement: The provision of Clawback arrangement would entail return of payout 
of reward (cash variable pay / long term incentive (LTI) i.e. any Share Linked Instrument) made in the 
previous years attributable to a given reference year wherein the incident has occurred. The return 
would be in terms of net amount. The RBI guidelines define clawback thus “A clawback is a contractual 
agreement between the employee and the bank in which the employee agrees to return previously 
paid or vested remuneration to the bank under certain circumstances.”
The malus and clawback clause will be actioned when the employee demonstrates behaviour involving 
fraudulent behaviour, moral turpitude, lack of integrity, flagrant breach of company policies and statutory 
norms resulting in financial or non-financial losses. Manifestation of behaviour listed above is presumed 
to have a malafide intent. Illustrative list of conditions are enumerated below. The occurrence of any /
some / all of the following conditions / events shall trigger a review by the NRC for the application of 
the Malus or the Clawback arrangement:
Substantial Financial Deterioration in profitability or risk parameters
Reckless, negligent or willful actions or exhibited inappropriate values and behavior
Fraud that requires a financial restatement
HDFC Bank Limited
3 5 8

Reputational harm
Exposing the bank to substantial risk
Such other conditions or events, of similar nature as above, as determined by NRC for triggering
review by NRC for the purpose of application of the Malus or the Clawback arrangement 
In determining the causes for deterioration in financial performance under (a), the NRC may take into 
consideration and have due regard to the fact whether the deterioration was for factors within control or 
whether it was on account of conditions like global market headwinds, industry performance, changes 
in legal / regulatory regime, force majeure events like occurrence of natural disasters, pandemic, other 
socio-economic conditions etc.
While undertaking the review for the concerned person for the application of the Malus or the Clawback 
arrangement based on any trigger events, when determining accountability of the concerned person, 
the NRC shall be guided by the principles of proportionality, culpability or proximity or nexus to the 
event or misconduct.
In accordance with the RBI guidelines, wherever the assessed divergence in bank’s provisioning for 
Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) or asset classification exceeds the prescribed threshold for public 
disclosure, the bank shall not pay the unvested portion of the variable compensation for the assessment 
year under ‘malus’ arrangement. Further, in such situations, no proposal for increase in variable pay 
(for the assessment year) shall be entertained. In case the bank’s post assessment Gross NPAs are 
less than 2.0%, these restrictions will apply only if criteria for public disclosure are triggered either on 
account of divergence in provisioning or both provisioning and asset classification.
The NRC may decide to apply malus on part, or all of the variable pay. The time horizon for the 
application of malus / clawback clause shall be four years from the date of reward.
The NRC shall review the act of misconduct / incident to ascertain the degree of accountability 
attributable to a Wholetime Director / Material Risk Taker / Senior Management (Job Bands C1 and 
above) prior to applying the Malus or Clawback arrangement.
The criteria for Malus / Clawback will be reviewed by the Nomination and Remuneration 
Committee annually.
The NRC and Board of Directors has also approved an addendum (Addendum- B) to the compensation 
policy on Clawback of Incentive Compensation in view of the final rules on listing standards for the 
recovery of erroneously awarded compensation adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission 
on October 26, 2022, applicable to companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. 
This Addendum-B shall be read with, and is in addition to, the Compensation Policy formulated and 
approved by the Board of Directors of the Bank. The same has been formulated to comply with 
the requirements of Section 10D promulgated under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended (“Exchange Act”), and Section 303A.14 of the NYSE so as to recover certain compensation 
in the event of an accounting restatement due to any material non-compliance relating to any financial 
reporting requirements under the applicable U.S. securities laws, and shall be interpreted and applied 
consistent therewith.

(vi) Approval Process:
The Variable Pay for Senior Management, Material Risk Takers other than Wholetime Directors, Risk 
and control staff is approved by the NRC and the Board. For Wholetime Directors the variable pay is 
approved by the NRC, Board and the Reserve Bank of India.
Employees other than Senior Management, Material Risk Takers, Whole Time Directors
The Bank has formulated the following variable pay plans:
(i) 
Annual Bonus Plan
The quantum of variable payout is a function of the performance of the Bank, performance of 
the business unit, performance of the individual employee, job band of the employee and the 
functional category. Basis these key determinants and due adjustment for risk alignment, a payout 
matrix for variable pay is developed. Market trends for specific businesses / functions along with 
inputs from compensation surveys may also be used in finalising the payout. 
Bonus pools are designed to meet specific business needs therefore resulting in differentiation 
in both the quantum and the method of payout across functions.
(ii) Performance-linked Plans (PLPs)
PLPs are formulated for employees in sales, collections, customer service and relationship roles 
who are given business / service targets but have limited impact on risk since credit decisions are 
exercised independent of these functions. All PLP payouts are based on a balanced scorecard 
framework which factors not just quantitative, but also qualitative measures, and are subject to 
achievement of individual targets enumerated in the respective scorecards of the employees. 
A portion of the PLP payouts is deferred till the end of the financial year to provide for any unforeseen 
performance risks. Employees who are on the PLPs are excluded from the Annual Bonus Plan.
(iii) Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOPs)
Employees in Job Bands D4 and above also receive ESOPs as a vehicle to create a balance 
between short term rewards and long term sustainable value creation. ESOPs play a key role in 
the attraction and retention of key talent. 
The NRC grants options after considering parameters such as the incumbent’s grade and 
performance rating, and such other factors as may be deemed appropriate by the NRC. 
All plans for grant of options are framed in accordance with the SEBI guidelines, 1999 as amended 
from time to time and are approved by the shareholders of the Bank. These plans provide for the 
grant of options post approval by the NRC.
The Bank grants ESOPs to eligible employees. Such ESOPs vest over four tranches spread over 
a period of 48 months. 
In accordance with the RBI guidelines, Employee Stock Options is included as part of Variable Pay.
HDFC Bank Limited
3 6 0

(iv) Restricted Stock Units (Units)
The bank granted units to employees at E3 – D3 bands (upto 10 levels below the MD). The 
same was approved by the NRC after considering parameters such as the employee’s grade, 
performance rating and any other factors as may be deemed appropriate by the NRC.
All plans for grant of units are framed in accordance with the SEBI guidelines, 1999 as amended 
from time to time and are approved by the shareholders of the Bank. These plans provide for the 
grant of units post approval by the NRC.
Such units vest over four tranches spread over a period of 48 months.
Risk, Control and Compliance Staff
The Bank has separated the Risk, Control and Compliance functions from the Business functions 
in order to create a strong culture of checks and balances and to eliminate any possible conflict of 
interest between revenue generation and risk management and control. Accordingly, the overall 
variable pay as well as the annual salary increment of the employees in the Risk, Control and 
Compliance functions is based on their performance, functional objectives and goals. The Bank 
ensures that the mix of fixed to variable compensation for these functions is weighted in favour 
of fixed compensation.
Guaranteed Bonus
Guaranteed bonuses are not consistent with sound risk management or pay for performance 
principles of the Bank and therefore do not form an integral part of the general compensation practice. 
For critical hiring for some select strategic roles, the Bank may consider granting of bonus, based 
on the performance rating upon confirmation, as a prudent way to avoid loading the entire cost 
of attraction into the fixed component of the compensation which could have a long term cost 
implication for the Bank. For such hiring, the said bonus is generally decided by taking into account 
appropriate risk factors and market conditions. 
For hiring at levels of Whole Time Directors / Managing Director / Material Risk Takers and certain 
employees in select strategic roles, a sign-on bonus, if any, is limited to the first year only and 
would be in the form of Employee Stock Options or Units (All units grants are subject to individual 
/ Business Unit / organizational performance criteria).
Severance Pay
The Bank does not grant severance pay other than accrued benefits (such as gratuity, pension) 
except in cases where it is mandated by any statute. 
Hedging
The Bank does not provide any facility or fund or permit its Whole Time Directors and employees 
to insure or hedge their compensation structure to offset the risk alignment effects embedded in 
their compensation arrangement. 
Statutory Bonus
Some employees are also paid statutory bonus as per the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965 as 
amended from time to time.

III. Remuneration Processes
Fitment at the time of Hire
Pay scales at the Bank are set basis the job size, experience, location and the academic and professional 
credentials of the incumbent. 
The compensation of new hires is in line with the existing pay ranges and consistent with the compensation levels 
of the existing employees of the Bank at similar profiles. The pay ranges are subject to change basis market trends 
and the Bank’s talent management priorities. While the Bank believes in the internal equity and parity as a key 
determinant of pay, it does acknowledge the external competitive pressures of the talent market. Accordingly, 
there could be certain key profiles with critical competencies which may be hired at a premium and treated as an 
exception to the overall pay philosophy. Any deviation from the defined pay ranges is treated as a hiring exception 
requiring approval with appropriate justification.
Pay Increment / Pay Revision
The Bank strives to ensure external competitiveness as well as internal equity without diluting the overall focus 
on optimising cost. In order to enhance the Bank’s external competitiveness, it participates in an annual salary 
survey of the banking sector to understand key market trends as well as get insights on relative market pay 
position compared to peers. The Bank endeavors to ensure that most employees progress to the median of the 
market in terms of fixed pay over time. This coupled with key internal data indicators like performance score, job 
family, experience, job grade and salary budget form the basis of decision making on revisions in fixed pay. 
Increments in fixed pay for majority of the employee population are generally undertaken once every financial 
year. However, promotions, confirmations and change in job dimensions could also lead to a change in the fixed 
pay during other times of the financial year.
The Bank also makes salary corrections and adjustments during the financial year for competitive pay positioning 
for the purpose of retention of critical skills and critical talent in the domain of Information Technology, Digital, 
Information Security, Data Science as well as business segments that are strategic focus areas of the bank. 
However, such pay revisions are done on an exception basis.
The Fixed Pay for the Material Risk Takers (other than Wholetime Directors), Senior Management, Key Management 
Personnel is approved by the NRC and the Board. The Fixed Pay for the Wholetime Directors is approved by the 
NRC, Board and the Reserve Bank of India.
Description of the ways in which current and future risks are taken into account in the remuneration
processes, including the nature and type of the key measures used to take account of these risks
The Bank takes into account various types of risks in its remuneration processes. The Bank follows a comprehensive 
framework that includes within its ambit the key dimensions of remuneration such as fixed pay, variable pay and long 
term incentives (i.e. Employee Stock Options). 
Fixed pay: The Bank conducts a comprehensive market benchmarking study to ensure that employees are 
competitively positioned in terms of fixed pay. The Bank follows a robust salary review process wherein revisions in 
fixed compensation are based on performance. The Bank also makes salary adjustments taking into consideration 
pay positioning of employees vis-à-vis market reference points. Through this approach the Bank endeavors to ensure 
that the talent risk due to attrition is mitigated. Fixed pay could be revised downwards as well, in the event of certain 
proven cases of misconduct by an employee.
 Variable pay: The Bank has distinct types of variable pay plans as given below:
HDFC Bank Limited
3 6 2

(a) 
Quarterly / monthly performance-linked pay (PLP) plans:
All quarterly / monthly PLP plans are based on the principle of balanced scorecard framework that includes within 
its ambit both quantitative and qualitative factors including key strategic objectives that ensure future competitive 
advantage for the Bank. PLP plans, by design, have deterrents that play a role of moderating payouts based on 
the non-fulfillment of established quantitative / qualitative risk factors. Deterrents also include risks arising out of 
non-compliance, mis-sell etc. Further, a portion of all payouts under the PLP plans is deferred till the end of the 
financial year to provide for any unforeseen performance risks. Employees who are part of the PLP plans are 
excluded from the Annual Bonus Plan.
(b) 
Variable Pay:
The Bank takes into consideration the fact that a portion of the Bank’s profits are directly attributable to various 
types of risks the Bank is exposed to such as credit risk and market risk.
 The framework developed by the Bank in order to arrive at the quantum of bonus pool is based on the 
performance of the Bank and profitability. The annual variable pay is distributed based on business unit and 
individual performance and job band and role of the individual for non-business functions. The business unit 
performance is based on factors such as growth in revenue, growth in profit, cost to income ratio and achievement 
vis-à-vis plans and key objectives. Bonus pay out for an individual employee in a particular grade is linked to the 
performance rating of the employee and subject to meeting the Bank’s standards of ethical conduct. 
 The Bank has devised appropriate malus and claw back clauses as a risk mitigant for Whole Time Directors, 
Material Risk Takers, Senior Management (i.e. Employees in the job Bands of Executive Vice President and 
above). Under the malus clause the incumbent could forego the vesting of the deferred variable pay in full or in 
part. Under the claw back clause the incumbent is obligated to return all the tranches of variable pay payout 
pertaining to the reference performance year. The deferred variable pay is paid out post review and approval by 
the NRC and the Board.
Description of the ways in which the Bank seeks to link performance during a performance measurement 
period with levels of remuneration
The Bank has a robust performance management system for evaluating the performance of its Whole Time Directors. 
The performance appraisal system is based on a Balanced Scorecard Framework and considers qualitative as well 
as quantitative factors of performance which includes the following parameters:
Business Performance - This includes business growth, profitability, asset quality and shareholder value.
Stakeholder Relationship - This includes net promoter score and corporate social responsibility.
Audit and Compliance - This includes internal audit reports and compliance with the regulations and
inspection reports.
Digital Transformation - This includes performance on initiatives required to run the bank and grow the bank.
Organizational Excellence - This includes succession planning and employee engagement.
While the above parameters form the core evaluation parameters for the Bank and the remuneration of its Whole Time 
Directors, each of the business units are measured on the following from a remuneration standpoint:

Growth in profit before tax (%) over previous year;
Improvement in cost to income over the previous year;
Improvement in Gross NPA over the previous year and
Achievement of key strategic objectives.
The process by which levels of remuneration in the Bank are aligned to the performance of the Bank, business unit 
and individual employees is articulated below:
Fixed Pay
The Bank reviews the fixed pay portion of the compensation structure basis merit-based increments and market 
corrections. These are based on a combination of performance rating, job band and the functional category of the 
individual employee. For a given job band, the merit increment is directly related to the performance rating. The Bank 
strives to ensure that most employees progress to the median of the market in terms of fixed pay over time. All other 
things remaining equal, the correction percentage is directly related to the performance rating of the individual.
Variable Pay
Basis the performance of the business unit, individual performance and role, the Bank has formulated the following 
variable pay plans: 
Variable Pay Plans:
For Employees in Job Bands of Sr Vice President I and Above (includes employees in Senior Management, 
Material Risk Takers, Wholetime Directors) the variable pay intends to reward short term as well as long term 
sustained performance of the bank and shareholder value creation.
Short term Performance: Short term performance is realised in the form of cash variable pay. The cash variable 
pay is based on performance rating and the job band of the individual and is further enhanced or moderated by 
the business performance multiplier and role. The cash variable pay is computed on the gross salary. 
Long term Performance: Employee Stock Options are granted to employees based on their performance rating 
and job band and the value of the same is realised vide long term performance of the bank and creation of 
shareholder value. 
 For Employees in job bands Vice President and below:
At these levels the variable pay is primarily in the form of cash variable pay and is based on the annual performance. 
In FY 2023-24, the Bank granted units at E3-D3 bands based on their performance rating, grade and any other 
such parameter as approved by the NRC.
The Bank’s annual bonus is computed as a percentage of the gross salary for every job band. The bonus multiple 
is based on performance of the business unit (based on the parameters above), performance rating, job band 
and the functional category of the individual employee. The business performance category determines the 
multiplier for the bonus. All other things remaining equal, for a given job band, the bonus is directly related to the 
performance rating. Employees who are part of the annual cash Variable Pay plan are not part of the Performance 
Linked Plans mentioned below.
HDFC Bank Limited

Performance-linked Plans (PLPs)
The Bank has formulated PLPs for its sales, collections, customer service and relationship roles who are given 
sales, collections and service targets basis a balanced scorecard methodology. All PLP payouts are subject to 
the achievement of individual targets enumerated in the respective scorecards of the employees and moderated 
by qualitative parameters. A portion of the PLP payouts is deferred till the end of the financial year to provide for 
any unforeseen performance risks. All PLPs are based on a balanced scorecard framework and, depending on 
the plan, could be paid out monthly or quarterly.
Description of the ways in which the Bank seeks to adjust remuneration to take account of the longer
term performance
For employees in Senior Management, Material Risk Takers and Whole Time Directors the bank seeks to adjust 
remuneration to take account of the longer term performance in the following way.
(i) 
Limits on variable pay
A substantial portion of compensation i.e. at least 50% will be variable and paid on the basis of individual, 
business-unit and organization performance. This will be in line with the principle that, at higher levels of 
responsibility, the proportion of variable pay will be higher. The total variable pay shall be limited to a maximum 
of 300% of the fixed pay.
In case the variable pay is upto 200% of the fixed pay, a minimum of 50% of the variable pay; and in case the 
variable pay is above 200%, a minimum of 67% of the variable pay shall be via non-cash instruments. The noncash component in 2023-24 comprised of Employee Stock Options.
In the event that the employee is barred by statute or regulation from grant of share-linked instruments, his / her 
variable pay will be capped at 150% of fixed pay but shall not be less than 50% of the fixed pay.
(ii) Deferral of variable pay
For senior management including Wholetime Directors (WTDs) and Material Risk Takers (MRTs), deferral 
arrangements will exist for the variable pay. A minimum of 60% of total variable pay will be under deferral 
arrangements. If cash component is a part of the variable pay, at least 50% of the cash bonus shall be deferred. 
In cases where cash component of the bonus is under Rs 25 lakh, deferral arrangements would not be necessary.
The deferral period would be a minimum of three years and will be applicable to both cash and non-cash 
components of variable pay. The deferral period for share linked instruments / ESOPs will be governed by the 
ESOP Scheme Rules which will be approved by the NRC and the Board. In 2023-24, the deferment of cash 
variable pay, where applicable, was 3 years in the case of cash variable pay and 4 years (vesting period) in the 
case of Employee Stock Options.
(iii) Vesting of Variable Pay
The deferred portion of the remuneration will vest at the end of deferral period and will be spread out over the

(iv) Malus / Clawback Arrangement:
The Bank believes in sustained business performance in tandem with prudent risk taking. The Bank, therefore, 
has devised appropriate deterrents in order to institutionalize the aforementioned commitment.
Malus Arrangement: The provision of a Malus arrangement would entail cancellation of payout for the deferred 
portion of reward (cash variable pay / long term incentive (LTI) i.e. any Share Linked Instrument). The RBI guidelines 
define malus thus “A malus arrangement permits the bank to prevent vesting of all or part of the amount of a deferred 
remuneration. Malus arrangement does not reverse vesting after it has already occurred.”
Clawback Arrangement: The provision of Clawback arrangement would entail return of payout of reward (cash 
variable pay / long term incentive (LTI) i.e. any Share Linked Instrument) made in the previous years attributable to a 
given reference year wherein the incident has occurred. The return would be in terms of net amount. The RBI guidelines 
define clawback thus “A clawback is a contractual agreement between the employee and the bank in which the 
employee agrees to return previously paid or vested remuneration to the bank under certain circumstances.”
The malus and clawback clause will be actioned when the employee demonstrates behaviour involving fraudulent 
behaviour, moral turpitude, lack of integrity, flagrant breach of company policies and statutory norms resulting in 
financial or non-financial losses. Manifestation of behaviour listed above is presumed to have a malafide intent. 
Illustrative list of conditions are enumerated below. The occurrence of any / some / all of the following conditions /
events shall trigger a review by the NRC for the application of the Malus or the Clawback arrangement:
a) Substantial financial deterioration in profitability or risk parameters
b) Reckless, negligent or willful actions or exhibited inappropriate values and behavior
c) Fraud that requires a financial restatement
d) Reputational harm
e) Exposing the bank to substantial risk
Such other conditions or events, of similar nature as above, as determined by NRC for triggering review by NRC
for the purpose of application of the Malus or the Clawback arrangement 
In determining the causes for deterioration in financial performance under (a), the NRC may take into consideration 
and have due regard to the fact whether the deterioration was for factors within control or whether it was on account 
of conditions like global market headwinds, industry performance, changes in legal / regulatory regime, force majeure 
events like occurrence of natural disasters, pandemic, other socio-economic conditions etc.
While undertaking the review for the concerned person for the application of the Malus or the Clawback arrangement 
based on any trigger events, when determining accountability of the concerned person, the NRC shall be guided by 
the principles of proportionality, culpability or proximity or nexus to the event or misconduct.
In accordance with the RBI guidelines, wherever the assessed divergence in bank’s provisioning for Non-Performing 
Assets (NPAs) or asset classification exceeds the prescribed threshold for public disclosure, the bank shall not pay the 
unvested portion of the variable compensation for the assessment year under ‘malus’ arrangement. Further, in such 
situations, no proposal for increase in variable pay (for the assessment year) shall be entertained. In case the bank’s 
post assessment Gross NPAs are less than 2.0%, these restrictions will apply only if criteria for public disclosure are 
triggered either on account of divergence in provisioning or both provisioning and asset classification.

The NRC may decide to apply malus on part, or all of the unvested deferred Variable pay. The time horizon for the 
application of malus / clawback clause shall be four years from the date of reward.
The NRC shall review the act of misconduct / incident to ascertain the degree of accountability attributable to 
a Wholetime Director / Material Risk Taker / Senior Management (C1 and above) prior to applying the Malus or 
Clawback arrangement.
The criteria for Malus / Clawback will be reviewed by the NRC annually.
The NRC and Board of Directors has also approved an addendum (Addendum- B) to the compensation policy on 
Clawback of Incentive Compensation in view of the final rules on listing standards for the recovery of erroneously 
awarded compensation adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 26, 2022, applicable to 
companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. 
This Addendum-B shall be read with, and is in addition to, the Compensation Policy formulated and approved by 
the Board of Directors of the Bank. The same has been formulated to comply with the requirements of Section 10D 
promulgated under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), and Section 303A.14 
of the NYSE so as to recover certain compensation in the event of an accounting restatement due to any material 
non-compliance relating to any financial reporting requirements under the applicable U.S. securities laws, and shall 
be interpreted and applied consistent therewith.
Employees other than Wholetime Directors, Material Risk Takers and Senior Management
The Bank has formulated the following variable pay plans:
Annual Cash Variable Pay plan:
The quantum of variable payout is a function of the performance of the Bank, performance of the individual 
employee, job band of the employee and the functional category. Basis these key determinants and due 
adjustment for risk alignment, a payout matrix for variable pay is developed. Market trends for specific businesses 
/ functions along with inputs from compensation surveys may also be used in finalising the payout. 
Bonus pools are designed to meet specific business needs therefore resulting in differentiation in both the 
quantum and the method of payout across functions. Typically higher levels of responsibility receive a higher 
proportion of variable pay vis-à-vis fixed pay. 
For Employees in Job Bands of Sr Vice President 1 and above Variable Pay intends to reward short term as well 
as long term sustained performance of the bank and shareholder value creation.
Short term Performance: Short term performance is realised in the form of cash variable pay. The cash variable 
pay is based on performance rating and the job band of the individual and is further enhanced or moderated by 
the business performance multiplier and role. The cash variable pay is computed on the gross salary. 
Long term Performance: Employee Stock Options are granted to employees based on their performance rating 
and Job band and the value of the same is realised vide long term performance of the bank and creation of 
shareholder value. The vesting period for Employee Stock Option is 4 years.
The Bank also granted Restricted Stock Units (Units) to employees at E3-D3 bands in FY23-24. The units 
would vest over 4 years.

Performance-linked Plans (PLPs)
The Bank has formulated PLPs for its sales, collections, customer service and relationship roles who are given 
sales, collections and service targets basis a balanced scorecard methodology. All PLP payouts are subject to 
the achievement of individual targets enumerated in the respective scorecards of the employees and moderated 
by qualitative parameters. A portion of the PLP payouts is deferred till the end of the financial year to provide for 
any unforeseen performance risks. All PLPs are based on a balanced scorecard framework and, depending on 
the plan, could be paid out monthly or quarterly.
Description of the different forms of variable remuneration (i.e. cash, shares, ESOPs and other forms)
that the Bank utilises and the rationale for using these different forms
The Bank recognises the importance of variable pay in reinforcing a pay for performance culture. Variable pay 
stimulates employees to stretch their abilities to exceed expectations.
Annual Cash Variable Pay
These are paid to reward performance for a given financial year. This covers all employees (excluding employees 
under PLPs). This is based on performance of the business unit, performance rating, job band and functional 
category of the individual. For higher job bands the proportion of variable pay to total compensation tends to be 
higher. For Material Risk Takers, Senior Management and Whole Time Directors 50% of the cash variable pay is 
deferred over 3 years in the event the cash variable pay exceeds 25 lakhs.
Performance-linked Plans (PLPs)
The Bank has formulated PLPs for its sales, collections, customer service and relationship roles who are given 
sales, collections and service targets basis a balanced scorecard methodology. All PLP payouts are subject to 
the achievement of individual targets enumerated in the respective scorecards of the employees and moderated 
by qualitative parameters. A portion of the PLP payouts is deferred till the end of the financial year to provide for 
any unforeseen performance risks. All PLPs are based on a balanced scorecard framework and, depending on 
the plan, could be paid out monthly or quarterly.
Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP)
This is to reward for contribution of employees in creating a long term, sustainable earnings and enhancing 
shareholder value. Only employees in a certain job band and with a specific performance rating are eligible for 
stock options. Performance is the key criteria for granting stock options.
Restricted Stock Units (Units)
The Bank granted Restricted Stock Units (Units) to employees at E3-D3 bands in FY23-24. The units would vest 
over 4 years.

18.6 Implementation of IFRS converged Indian Accounting Standards

of Indian Accounting Standards (IND-AS) for scheduled commercial banks, insurers / insurance companies and 
non-banking financial companies, which was subsequently confirmed by the RBI through its circular dated February 
11, 2016. This roadmap required these institutions to prepare IND-AS based financial statements for the accounting 
periods beginning April 01, 2018 with comparatives for the periods beginning April 01, 2017. The implementation 
of IND-AS by banks requires certain legislative changes in the format of financial statements to comply with the 
disclosures required under IND-AS. In April 2018, the RBI deferred the implementation of IND-AS by a year by when 
the necessary legislative amendments were expected. The legislative amendments recommended by the RBI are 
under consideration by the Government of India. Accordingly, the RBI, through its circular dated March 22, 2019, 
deferred the implementation of IND-AS until further notice.

The RBI vide its circular dated September 12, 2023 has revised the norms on classification, measurement and valuation

Provident fund
The guidance note on AS-15, Employee Benefits, states that employer established provident funds, where interest is 
guaranteed are to be considered as defined benefit plans and the liability has to be valued. The Institute of Actuaries of 
India (IAI) has issued a guidance note on valuation of interest rate guarantees on exempt provident funds. The actuary 
has accordingly valued the same and the Bank held a provision of Nil as at March 31, 2024 (previous year: Nil), towards 
the present value of the guaranteed interest benefit obligation. The actuary has followed the deterministic approach as 
prescribed by the guidance note.

Contingent liability*
Brief description

Claims against the Bank not 
acknowledged as debts - taxation
The Bank is a party to various taxation matters in respect of which appeals are 
pending. The Bank expects the outcome of the appeals to be favorable based on 
decisions on similar issues in the previous years by the appellate authorities, based 
on the facts of the case and taxation laws. 

Claims against the Bank not 
acknowledged as debts - others
The Bank is a party to various legal proceedings in the normal course of business. 
The Bank does not expect the outcome of these proceedings to have a material 
adverse effect on the Bank’s financial conditions, results of operations or cash 
flows.

Partly paid investments
This represents amount remaining unpaid towards liability for partly paid 
investments. 

Liability on account of forward 
exchange and derivative contracts
The Bank enters into foreign exchange contracts, currency options, forward rate 
agreements, currency swaps and interest rate swaps with inter-bank participants 
on its own account and for customers. Forward exchange contracts are 
commitments to buy or sell foreign currency at a future date at the contracted 
rate. Currency swaps are commitments to exchange cash flows by way of interest 
/ principal in one currency against another, based on predetermined rates. Interest 
rate swaps are commitments to exchange fixed and floating interest rate cash flows. 
The notional amounts of financial instruments such as foreign exchange contracts 
and derivatives provide a basis for comparison with instruments recognised on the 
Balance Sheet but do not necessarily indicate the amounts of future cash flows 
involved or the current fair value of the instruments and, therefore, do not indicate 
the Bank’s exposure to credit or price risks. The derivative instruments become 
favorable (assets) or unfavorable (liabilities) as a result of fluctuations in market 
rates or prices relative to their terms. 

Guarantees given on behalf 
of constituents, acceptances, 
endorsements and other obligations
As a part of its commercial banking activities, the Bank issues documentary credit 
and guarantees on behalf of its customers. Documentary credits such as letters of 
credit enhance the credit standing of the Bank’s customers. Guarantees generally 
represent irrevocable assurances that the Bank will make payments in the event of 
the customer failing to fulfill its financial or performance obligations.

Other items for which the Bank is 
contingently liable
These include: a) Credit enhancements in respect of securitised-out loans; b) Bills 
rediscounted by the Bank; c) Capital commitments; d) Underwriting commitments; 
e) Investment purchases pending settlement; f) Amount transferred to the RBI
under the Depositor Education and Awareness Fund (DEAF).

Identification and Provisioning of Non-performing Advances (NPA): 
Total NPA as at March 31, 2024: 31,056.65 Crores 
Provision for NPA as at March 31, 2024: 22,966.09 Crores
(Refer Schedule 9 and Schedule 17 D(3))
Key Audit Matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
The Bank is required to comply with the Master Circular dated April 
01, 2023 issued by the Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) on “Prudential 
Norms on Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning 
pertaining to Advances” (the “IRAC norms”) and amendments thereto, 
which prescribe the guidelines for identification and classification of 
Non-performing Advances and the minimum provision required for 
such assets.
The Bank is also required to apply its judgement to determine the 
identification and provision required against Non-performing Advances 
considering various quantitative as well as qualitative factors. The 
identification of Non-performing Advances is also affected by factors 
like stress and liquidity concerns in certain sectors.
The provision for identified Non-performing Advances is estimated 
based on ageing and classification of Non-performing Advances, 
nature of product, value of security etc., and is also subject to the 
minimum provisioning norms specified by RBI. Since the identification 
of Non-performing Advances and provisioning for Non-performing 
Advances requires considerable level of management estimation, 
application of various regulatory requirements and in view of its 
significance to the overall audit, we have identified this as a key audit 
matter.
Our audit procedures included the following:
 Understood the process and controls, and tested the design and 
operating effectiveness of key controls, including Information 
Technology based controls, and focused on the following:
• Monitoring of credit quality which amongst other things
includes the monitoring of overdue loan accounts and 
drawing power;
• Identification 
and 
classification 
Non-performing
Advances in accordance with IRAC norms, other 
regulatory guidelines issued by the RBI and consideration 
of qualitative aspects; and
• Testing of application controls including testing of
automated controls and reports. 
 Evaluated the governance process and controls over calculations 
of provision for Non-performing Advances and tested that the 
basis of provisioning is in accordance with the Board of Directors 
approved policy and IRAC norms.
 With respect to classification of Non-performing Advances,
verified the date of Non-performing Advances and recomputed 
the Days Past Due on a sample basis.
 On a test check basis, verified the classification of accounts
reported by the Bank as Special Mention Accounts (‘SMA’) 
in RBI’s Central Repository of Information on Large Credits 
(‘CRILC’).
 With respect to provisions recognised towards Non-performing
Advances, provision calculations on a sample basis taking 
into consideration the value of security, where applicable, the 
IRAC norms and the policy of the Bank, and compared our 
outcome to that prepared by the management and tested 
relevant assumptions and judgements which were used by the 
management.

Appropriateness of accounting for amalgamation of erstwhile Housing Development Finance Corporation Limited (“erstwhile HDFC Limited”) 
with the Bank, the related adjustments [including adjustments to and integration of Information Technology (IT) systems] and communications 
with RBI relating to the amalgamation
(Refer Schedule 18 Note 1)
Key Audit Matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
The composite scheme for the amalgamation of (i) erstwhile HDFC 
Investments Limited and erstwhile HDFC Holdings Limited into and 
with erstwhile HDFC Limited and (ii) erstwhile HDFC Limited into 
and with the Bank, (the “Scheme”) has been given effect to in the 
Consolidated Financial statements with effect from July 1, 2023 (i.e., 
the appointed and effective date for the Scheme), in accordance with 
the ‘pooling of interests’ method as prescribed in AS-14 “Accounting 
for Amalgamations”.
The amalgamation entailed transfer of various IT systems of the 
erstwhile HDFC Limited to the Bank, including integration of some 
systems with the financial reporting system and other related 
applications of the Bank; and transfer of underlying financial data of 
the erstwhile HDFC Limited’s business.
Further, the Bank had sought certain forbearances from the RBI. The 
RBI has granted certain forbearances and provided clarifications to 
the Bank through various communications.
Considering the magnitude of the amounts involved, complexity of 
the transaction and the related adjustments (including those related 
to IT systems impacting financial reporting) impacting Consolidated 
Financial Statements, and in view of its significance to the overall 
financial statements, we have determined the accounting for the 
amalgamation and the related adjustments (including those to IT 
systems impacting financial reporting) and communication with RBI 
relating to the amalgamation, to be a key audit matter.
Our audit procedures included the following:
 Understood the process and controls, and tested the design
and operating effectiveness of key controls, including 
Information Technology general and application controls relating 
to accounting for amalgamations, and integration of IT Systems 
(impacting financial reporting) of erstwhile HDFC Limited; 
 Perused the NCLT approved Scheme of Amalgamation for the
appropriateness of determination of the effective date of the 
scheme and the accounting treatment as prescribed in the 
Scheme;
 Traced the assets and liabilities of erstwhile HDFC Limited
recognised on amalgamation to the special purpose financial 
information as at the appointed and effective date of the 
Scheme, audited by other auditors;
 Tested the share swap and amalgamation adjustments for
appropriate recording of the resultant impact on the standalone 
reserves of the Bank;
 Tested on a sample basis the underlying financial data of erstwhile 
HDFC Limited transferred to the Bank and its integration with the 
financial information of the Bank as on the effective date;
 Read communications of the Bank with the RBI seeking certain
forbearances relating to the operations of the Bank post the 
amalgamation, having an impact on the financial reporting and 
assessed their impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements; 
 Assessed the adequacy and appropriateness of the disclosures
relating to the amalgamation made in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.

Information Technology (“IT”) Systems and Controls impacting Financial Reporting
Key Audit Matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
The IT environment of the Bank is complex and involves a large 
number of independent and interdependent IT systems used in the 
operations of the Bank for processing and recording a large volume 
of transactions.
As a result, there is a high degree of reliance and dependency on such 
IT systems for the financial reporting process of the Bank.
Appropriate IT general controls and IT application controls are required 
to ensure that such IT systems are able to process the data as required, 
completely, accurately, and consistently for reliable financial reporting.
We have identified certain key IT systems (“in-scope” IT systems) 
which have an impact on the financial reporting process and the 
related controls testing as a key audit matter because of the high 
level of automation, significant number of systems being used by 
the Bank for processing financial transactions, the complexity of the 
IT architecture and its impact on the financial records and financial 
reporting process of the Bank.
Our procedures with respect to this matter included the following:
 In assessing the controls over the IT systems of the Bank, we
involved our technology specialists to obtain an understanding 
of the IT environment, IT infrastructure and IT systems. We 
evaluated and tested relevant IT general controls over the “inscope” IT systems and IT dependencies identified as relevant for 
our audit of the consolidated financial statements and financial 
reporting process of the Bank. On such “in-scope” IT systems, 
we tested key IT general controls with respect to the following 
domains:
 Program change management, which includes that
program changes are moved to the production 
environment as per defined procedures and relevant 
segregation of environment is ensured.
 User access management, which includes user access
provisioning, de-provisioning, access review, password 
management, sensitive access rights and segregation 
of duties to ensure that privilege access to applications, 
operating systems and databases in the production 
environment were granted only to authorized personnel.
 Program development, which includes controls over IT
application development or implementation and related 
infrastructure, which are relied upon for financial reporting.
 IT operations, which includes job scheduling, monitoring
and backup and recovery.
 We also evaluated the design and tested the operating
effectiveness of relevant key IT dependencies within the key 
business process, which included testing automated controls, 
automated calculations / accounting procedures, interfaces, 
segregation of duties and system generated reports, as 
applicable.
 We communicated with those charged with governance and
management and tested a combination of compensating 
controls or remediated controls and / or performed alternative 
audit procedures, where necessary.

The following Key Audit Matters were included in the audit report dated April 19, 2024, containing an unmodified audit
opinion on the special purpose consolidated financial statements of HDFC Life Insurance Company Limited (‘HDFC Life/ the 
Holding Company’ referred to in its report), a subsidiary of the Parent issued by Price Waterhouse Chartered Accountants 
LLP and G. M. Kapadia & Co., independent firm of Chartered Accountants reproduced by us as under:
Key Audit Matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Appropriateness of the Timing of Revenue Recognition in the proper 
period 
Refer Schedule 14 of the Special purpose consolidated financial 
statement and for accounting policy, refer Schedule 17 (8) of the 
Special purpose consolidated financial Statement. 
During the period, the Holding Company has recognised premium 
revenue of R 23,768 crores towards new business (first year premium 
and single premium). Out of the total revenue recognised, R 9,532 
crores were recognised during the last quarter.
This area was considered a key audit matter because of the significant 
concentration of revenue during the last quarter of financial period 
(including cut-off at the Balance sheet date). Due to the nature of the 
industry, revenue is skewed towards the balance sheet date. Hence, 
there is possibility that policy sales of the next financial year are 
accounted in the current period.
Our procedures included the following: 
 Understood and evaluated the design and tested the operating
effectiveness of process and controls relating to recognition of 
revenue (including testing of key controls for verifying that the 
revenue has been accrued in the correct accounting period).
 Tested on a sample basis the policies at the period end to confirm 
if related procedural compliances with regard to acceptability of 
the terms of policy were completed before or after the period 
end to verify appropriate accounting of revenue. 
 Verified on a sample basis to verify that policy sales of the next
financial year are not accounted for in the current period. 
 Tested on a sample basis, the unallocated premium to
corroborate that there were no policies where risk commenced 
prior to balance sheet but revenue was not recognized. 
 Tested the manual accounting journal entries relating to revenue
on a sample basis so as to identify unusual or irregular items. We 
agreed the journal entries tested to supporting evidence.
 Tested on a sample basis cheques receipt with the time stamp in 
case of products like Unit Linked Insurance Plan to confirm the 
recognition of the revenue in correct accounting period. 
Based on the work carried out, we did not come across any material 
exception which suggests that the revenue recognition is not 
accounted in the correct period
Schedule 14 and Schedule 17 (8), as described in the above paragraph, are included in the Schedule 14 and Schedule 17 D (11), 
respectively of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Appropriateness of the classification and valuation of Investments
Refer Schedule 7 and 8 of the Special purpose consolidated financial 
statement. For accounting policy, refer Schedule 17 D(1) and D(17) to 
the special purpose consolidated financial statements.
The Holding Company holds investments against policy holders’ 
liabilities, linked liabilities and shareholders’ funds. A significant portion 
of the assets of the Holding Company is in the form of investments (total 
investments as at March 31, 2024 is R 292,220 crore). As prescribed 
by IRDAI all investments including derivative instruments, should be 
made and managed in accordance with the Insurance Regulatory 
and Development Authority of India (Investment) Regulations, 2016 
(the “Investment Regulations”) and policies approved by Board of 
Directors of the Holding Company. Further, investments including 
derivative instruments (which involves complex calculations to value 
such instruments) should be valued as prescribed in the Investment 
Regulations which state the valuation methodology to be used for 
each class of investment. This area was considered as a key audit 
matter as the valuation of unlisted or not frequently traded investment 
involves management judgement. Also, due to events affecting 
the investee company’s rating, there could be a need to reclassify 
investment and assess its valuation / impairment per the requirements 
of the Investment Regulations and / or Holding Company’s internal 
policies.
Our procedures included the following:
Understood Management’s process and controls to ensure
proper classification and valuation / impairment of Investment.
Evaluated the design and tested operating effectiveness of the
related controls implemented by the management.
Testing of key controls over investment classification and
valuation / impairment
Tested on a sample basis, the correct recording of investments
(including derivative instruments), classification and compliance 
with Investment Regulations and policies approved by the Board 
of Directors.
Tested on a sample basis the valuation of securities which have
been valued in accordance with the Investment Regulations 
and the Holding Company’s accounting policies. We verified 
the calculations made by management to assess the value 
of derivative instruments by involving auditor’s independent 
experts. 
Tested on a sample basis impairment of securities (including
reversal of impairment) which have been impaired / impairment 
recognised earlier has been (reversed) in accordance with the 
Investment Regulations and Holding Company’s impairment 
policies.
For unlisted and not frequently traded investments, we
evaluated management’s valuation model and assumptions 
and corroborated these with regulatory requirements and the 
Holding Company’s internal policies including impairment.
For an event specific reclassification and valuation, we
corroborated management’s assessment with the regulatory 
requirements and the Holding Company’s internal policies. 
Based on the work carried out, we did not come across any material 
exception which suggests that the investments were not properly 
classified or valued.
Schedule 7 and 8, Schedule 17 D(1) and D(17), as described in the above paragraph, are included in the Schedule 7 and 8, 
Schedule 17 D(1) and 17 D(26), respectively of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

to certain matters pertaining to Goods and service tax (GST) and 
Income tax
Refer Schedule 19 note 7 of special purpose consolidated financial 
statement and For accounting policy, refer Schedule note 17 no. 16 to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
The Holding Company has received various demands and show

external advisors and counsel (together Holding Company’s 
management expert), where applicable, have made judgments relating 
to the likelihood of an obligation arising and whether there is a need to 
recognize a provision or disclose a contingent liability.
This area is considered as a key audit matter, as evaluation of 
these matters requires Management judgement, estimation and 
assessment, interpretation of laws and regulations and application of 
relevant judicial precedents to determine the probability of outcome 
of ongoing proceedings and outflow of economic resources, if any, 
and the recognition of provisions, disclosure of contingent liabilities 
and related disclosures to be made in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.
Our audit procedures included the following: 
 Understood Management’s process and control for determining
tax litigations and its appropriate accounting and disclosure.
 Evaluating the design and testing operating effectiveness of
controls over the recognition, measurement, presentation and 
disclosure made in the Consolidated Financial Statements in 
respect of these matters. Testing key controls implemented 
by the Holding Company’s Management with respect to tax 
litigations.

Information Technology
IT systems and controls 
The Company’s financial reporting processes are dependent on 
technology considering significant number of transactions that 
are processed daily across multiple and discrete Information 
Technology (‘IT’) systems. The Financial accounting system 
of the Company is interfaced with several other IT systems 
including Loan Management & Originating systems and several 
other systemic workflows. 
IT general and application controls are critical to ensure that 
changes to applications and underlying data are made in an 
appropriate manner. Adequate controls contribute to mitigating 
the risk of potential fraud or errors as a result of changes to the 
applications and data. 
These includes implementation of preventive and detective 
controls across critical applications and infrastructure. 
Due to the pervasive nature of role of information technology 
systems in financial reporting, in our preliminary risk 
assessment, we planned our audit by assessing the risk of a 
material misstatement arising from the technology as significant 
for the audit, hence the Key Audit Matter.
In course of audit, our focus was on user access management, 
change management, segregation of duties, system reconciliation 
controls and system application controls over key financial accounting 
and reporting systems. We performed a range of audit procedures, 
which included: 
 Review of the report of is Audit carried in earlier year(s) by
an independent firm of Chartered Accountants pertaining 
to IT systems general controls including access rights over 
applications, operating systems and databases relied upon for 
financial reporting. 
 Deployed our internal experts to carry out IT general Controls
testing and identifying gaps, if any. 
 Our other processes include:
 Selectively recomputing interest calculations and maturity
dates;
 Selectively re-evaluating masters updation, interface with
resultant reports;
 Selective testing of the interface of INFOR with other IT
systems like LMS and other workflows.
 Testing of the system generated reports and accounting
entries manually for core financial reporting matters (i.e. 
verification around the computer system)
 Evaluating the design, implementation and operating
effectiveness of the significant accounts-related IT 
automated controls which are relevant to the accuracy 
of system calculation, and the consistency of data 
transmission. 
 Other areas that were independently assessed included
password policies, system configurations, system 
interface controls, controls over changes to applications 
and databases.

Valuation and impairment determination of Investments
Refer Schedule 8 of the Special Purpose Financial Information
Key Audit Matter
How the matter was addressed in our audit
The Company’s investment portfolio has been bifurcated into 
Policyholders investments and Shareholders investments in terms of 
IRDAI guidelines. Total investments represent 87.38 percent of the 
Company’s total assets as at 31 March 2024. 
Investments amounting to INR 25,354.97 Crores are valued as per the 
Group Accounting Policy, based on which:
• the listed equity shares, additional Tier I bonds and mutual fund
units have been valued at fair value; and
• debt securities and unlisted equity shares are valued at historical
cost.
Investments in listed equity shares, additional Tier I bonds and 
mutual funds does not represent higher risk of material misstatement, 
however, is considered to be a key audit matter due to its materiality 
to the special purpose financial information. 
Further, investments in debt securities and unlisted equity shares are 
assessed for impairment as per the Company’s investment policy 
which involves significant management judgement. There is increased 
economic stress on account of external factors, which may impact the 
determination of impairment of these investments. 
Accordingly, 
valuation 
investments 
(including 
impairment 
assessment) was considered to be one of the areas which required 
significant auditor attention and was one of the matters of most 
significance in the special purpose financial information.
Our audit procedures included the following: 
Understood the Company’s process and tested the controls on 
the valuation of investments; 
Evaluated design, implementation and operating effectiveness
of key controls over the valuation process including

Key Audit Matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
1. IT Systems and controls
The financial accounting and reporting systems of the Company 
are fundamentally reliant on IT systems and IT controls to process 
significant transaction volumes. 
Automated accounting procedures and IT environment controls, which 
include IT governance, general IT controls over program development 
and changes, access to programs and data and IT operations, are 
required to be designed and to operate effectively to ensure accurate 
financial reporting. 
Therefore, due to the pervasive nature and complexity of the IT 
environment, the assessment of the general IT controls and the 
application controls specific to the accounting and preparation of the 
financial information is considered to be a key audit matter. 
We performed the following procedures assisted by specialized IT 
auditors on the IT infrastructure and applications relevant to financial 
reporting: 
Tested the design and operating effectiveness of IT access
controls, including audit trail, -over the information systems 
that are relevant to financial reporting and relevant interfaces, 
configuration and other identified application controls. 
Tested IT general controls (logical access, change management 
and aspects of IT operational controls). This included testing 
that requests for access and changes of access to systems 
were appropriately reviewed, authorized.
Tested the Company’s periodic review of access rights.
We also tested requests of changes to systems for approval
and authorization. 
Tested the design and operating effectiveness of compensating 
manual controls in case deficiencies were identified and, 
where necessary, extended the scope of our substantive audit 
procedures.

The following Key Audit Matter was reported to us by the auditors, B S R & Co. LLP, of HDFC Asset Management Company 
Limited (‘HDFC Asset Management Company Limited’/ the Company’ referred to in its report), a subsidiary of the Parent, 
vide their communication dated April 19, 2024 which is reproduced by us as under:
Key Audit Matter
How the audit was addressed in our audit
Investment Management Fee is a significant account balance in the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. Investment management 
fees from the Mutual fund consists of fees from various schemes 
which invest in different categories of securities in the market like 
Equity, Debt etc.
We have identified revenue from investment management service as a 
key audit matter since: 
1. The calculation of investment management fees is a percentage
of the assets under management (‘AUM’) managed by the 
Company. There is a process wherein approved fee rates is 
a manual input in the system for computation of Investment 
Management Fee income. AUM is calculated by the system on 
a daily basis for each scheme.
2. Multiple schemes of HDFC Mutual Fund require effective
monitoring over key financial terms and conditions being captured 
and applied accurately. Any discrepancy in such computations 
could result in misstatement of investment management fee 
recognised in the consolidated financial statements.
In view of the significance of the matter we applied the following 
audit procedures in this area, among others to obtain sufficient 
appropriate audit evidence: 
Testing of Design and Operating Effectiveness of controls:-
Understood and evaluated the design and implementation
of authorisation controls and other key controls relating to 
recognition of investment management fee;
ii. 
Test checked the operating effectiveness of authorisation
controls, and other key controls over recognition of investment 
management fee.
Substantive tests:
iii. 
Evaluated the appropriateness of revenue recognition in
respect of investment management fee income based on the 
requirements of AS 9;
iv. 
Obtained and tested arithmetical accuracy of investment
management fee calculations and reconciled investment 
management fee to amounts included in the consolidated 
financial statements for completeness of income recognition; 
Test checked that investment management fee rates were
approved by authorised personnel before being manually 
entered in the system; 
vi. 
Obtained and read the investment management fee certification 
reports, issued by the statutory auditors of mutual fund 
schemes for such work and reconciled the certified amounts 
with the accounting records; 
vii. Test checked the investment management fee invoices and
reconciled with the accounting records; 
viii. Test checked the receipts of money of Investment Management 
fee income in the bank statements;
Evaluated the adequacy of disclosures relating to the investment 
management fee earned by the Company.
Other Information
10. The Bank’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information
included in Annual report but does not include the Standalone Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial Statements 
and our and other auditor’s report thereon. The Annual report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this 
auditor’s report. 
Our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially 
inconsistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to 
be materially misstated.
When we read the Annual Report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to 
communicate the matter to those charged with governance and take appropriate action as applicable under the relevant 
laws and regulations.

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial 
Statements
11. The Bank’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these Consolidated Financial Statements 
in terms of the requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated 
financial performance and consolidated cash flows of the Group including the Employee Welfare Trust in accordance with 
the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Accounting Standards specified under Section 133 
of the Act, and the provisions of Section 29 of the Banking Regulations Act, 1949 and circulars and guidelines issued by 
the Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) from time to time. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the 
Group and the trustees of the Employee Welfare Trust are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in 
accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group and the Employee Welfare Trust and 
for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; 
making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of 
adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the 
accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements that give a true 
and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose 
of preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements by the Board of Directors of the Bank, as aforesaid.
12. In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the
Group and the trustees of Employee Welfare Trust are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group and the Employee 
Welfare Trust to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the 
going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group and the Employee Welfare 
Trust to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
13. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and the trustees of the Employee Welfare Trust
are responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the Group and the Employee Welfare Trust.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
14. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs 
will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these Consolidated Financial Statements.
15. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism
throughout the audit. We also:
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate
in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether 
the Bank has adequate internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements in place and 
the operating effectiveness of such controls.
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by management.

Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant 
doubt on the ability of the Group and the Employee Welfare Trust to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that 
a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the 
consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are 
based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may 
cause the Group and the Employee Welfare Trust to cease to continue as a going concern. 
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the Consolidated Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in 
a manner that achieves fair presentation. 
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities
within the Group and the Employee Welfare Trust to express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements. We 
are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the financial statements of such entities 
included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of which we are the independent auditors. For the other entities 
included in the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been audited by other auditors, such other auditors 
remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely 
responsible for our audit opinion.
16. We communicate with those charged with governance of the Bank and such other entities included in the Consolidated
Financial Statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify 
during our audit.
17. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought 
to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
18. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most
significance in the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the current year and are therefore the key audit 
matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the 
matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report 
because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of 
such communication.

Standards on Auditing deemed to be prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable 
to an audit of internal financial controls, both applicable to an audit of internal financial controls and both issued by the ICAI. 
Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit 
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial 
statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls
system with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial 
controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial 
controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing 
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures 
selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of
their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion on the Group’s internal financial controls system with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
A Bank’s internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements 
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Bank’s internal financial control with 
reference to Consolidated Financial Statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance 
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the 
Group; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of Consolidated 
Financial Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures 
of the Group are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the Group; and (3) 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of 
the Group’s assets that could have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements,
including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or 
fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to 
Consolidated Financial Statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference 
to Consolidated Financial Statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of 
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Group, has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system with reference to
Consolidated Financial statements and such internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial statements 
were operating effectively as at March 31, 2024, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established 
by the Group considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.
Other Matters
Our aforesaid reports under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal financial 
controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements insofar as it relates to 8 subsidiary companies, which are 
companies incorporated in India, is based on the corresponding reports of the other auditors. 
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

SCHEDULES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
As at March 31, 2024
Schedule 17 - Significant accounting policies 
appended to and forming part of the consolidated 
financial statements for the year ended March 31, 

BACKGROUND
 HDFC Bank Limited (‘HDFC Bank’ or ‘the Bank’ or ‘the 
Holding Company’), incorporated in Mumbai, India is a 
publicly held banking company. The Bank is governed 
by the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and the Companies 
Act, 2013. The Bank together with its subsidiaries is 
engaged in providing a range of banking and financial 
services, including retail banking, wholesale banking, 
treasury operations, insurance, asset management, 
stock broking and other financial services business. 
The Bank has overseas branch operations in Bahrain, 
Hong Kong, Dubai and Offshore Banking Unit at 
International Financial Service Centre (IFSC), GIFT City, 
India. These consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared by giving effect to the Scheme referred to in 
Schedule 18(1) from July 01, 2023 onwards. 
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements comprise the 
financial statements of the Bank and its subsidiaries 
constituting the ‘Group’. The Bank consolidates its 
subsidiaries in accordance with Accounting Standard 
(‘AS’) 21, Consolidated Financial Statements, specified 
under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, on a lineby-line basis by adding together the like items of assets, 
liabilities, income and expenditure, after elimination 
of intra-group transactions and intra-group balances, 
except for equity investment held in group entities 
through policyholder’s funds. Capital reserve / goodwill 
on consolidation represent the difference between the 
Group’s share in the net worth of the subsidiary and the 
cost of acquisition at the time of making the investment in /
acquisition of the subsidiary. Minority interest representing 
the part of net results of operations and of the net assets 
of subsidiary, attributable to interests not owned directly 
or indirectly through subsidiaries, is presented separately 
from liabilities and equity.
The Group does not consolidate entities where the control 
/ significant influence is intended to be temporary or 
entities which operate under severe long term restrictions 
that impair their ability to transfer funds to parent / 
investing entity or where the objective of control is not to 
obtain economic benefit from their activities. For certain 
investments, even though the shareholding may be below 
20%, the Group may be eligible for nominee directors in the 
investee company. Such investments are considered to 
be at par with other companies where investment may be 
bought and sold depending upon market condition. Right 
to appoint nominee director in the investee companies 
with protective rights, as such does not result in control 
or significant influence on such companies.
The consolidated financial statements present the accounts of HDFC Bank Limited with its following subsidiaries:

The financial statements of certain subsidiaries are 
prepared in accordance with notified Indian Accounting 
Standards (‘Ind-AS’) or applicable local generally 
accepted accounting principles. The financial statements 
of such subsidiaries used for consolidation are special 
purpose financial information prepared in accordance 
with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in India 
(‘GAAP’) specified under Section 133 of the Companies 
Act, 2013 read together with the Companies (Accounts) 
Rules, 2014 and the Companies (Accounting Standards) 
Rules, 2021. 
The Bank has not consolidated its subsidiaries viz 
HDFC Credila Financial Services Ltd (‘HDFC Credila’) 
and HDFC Education and Development Services Pvt 
Ltd under AS 21 as the control of these subsidiaries is 
intended to be temporary (as directed by RBI) on the 
date of their acquisition. Subsequently, the Bank has 
diluted its holding in HDFC Credila to 9.99% as on the 
Balance sheet date.
The audited special purpose financial information of 
foreign subsidiaries used in consolidation are drawn up 
to the same reporting date as that of the Group.
ACCOUNTING METHODOLOGY 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared 
and presented under the historical cost convention and 
accrual basis of accounting, unless otherwise stated and 
are in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting 
Principles in India (‘Indian GAAP’), statutory requirements 
prescribed under the Third Schedule of the Banking 
Regulation Act, 1949, directions, circular, notifications 
and the guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India 
(RBI) (‘RBI Guidelines’), Securities and Exchange Board 
of India (‘SEBI’), Insurance Regulatory and Development 
Authority of India (‘IRDAI’) from time to time, Accounting 
Standards (‘AS’) specified under Section 133 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 read together with the Companies 
(Accounts) Rules, 2014 and the Companies (Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2021, as applicable to relevant entities 
and practices generally prevalent in the banking industry 
in India. In case the accounting policies followed by a 
subsidiary is different from those followed by the Bank, 
the same have been disclosed separately.
Use of estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in 
conformity with Indian GAAP requires the management 
to make estimates and necessary assumptions in the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities (including 
contingent liabilities) as at the date of the consolidated 
financial statements and the reported income and 
expenses for the reporting year. Management believes that 
the estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated 
financial statements are prudent and reasonable. Actual 
results could differ from these estimates. The impact of 
any revision in the accounting estimates is recognised 
prospectively from the period of change.

guidelines. The short position is categorised under HFT 
category and netted off from investments in government 
securities. The short position along with other government 
securities under HFT portfolio is marked to market and 
the resultant loss, if any, is charged to the Consolidated 
Profit and Loss Account while gain, if any, is ignored. Profit 
/ Loss on short sale is recognised on settlement date.

Sector-PTCs are valued by using FIMMDA credit spread 
as applicable for the NBFC category, based on the credit 
rating of the respective PTC over the YTM rates for 
Government of India securities published by FBIL. 
Investments classified under HTM category are carried 
at their acquisition cost and not marked to market. Any 
premium on acquisition is amortised over the remaining 
maturity period of the security on a constant yield-tomaturity basis. Such amortisation of premium is adjusted 
against interest income from investments. Any diminution, 
other than temporary, in the value of investments in HTM

Bank 
 
Classification:
Advances are classified as performing and non-performing 
based on the RBI guidelines and are stated net of bills 
rediscounted, inter-bank participation with risk, specific 
loan loss provision, interest suspense for non-performing 
advances, claims received from credit guarantors,

diminution in the fair value of restructured assets. 
 
Provisioning:
 The Bank classifies its loans and investments, including 
at overseas branches and overdues from crystallised 
derivative contracts, into performing and non-performing 
in accordance with RBI guidelines. Further the NPAs are 
classified into sub-standard, doubtful and loss assets 
based on the RBI guidelines. Non-performing assets are 
upgraded into standard as per the extant RBI guidelines.
Specific loan loss provision in respect of non-performing 
advances is made based on management’s assessment 
of the degree of impairment of advances, subject to the 
minimum provisioning prescribed by the RBI. 
The specific loan loss provision for retail non-performing 
advances is also made based on the nature of product 
and delinquency levels. 
Non-performing advances are written-off in accordance 
with the Bank’s policy. Recoveries from bad debts writtenoff are included under other income. 
Loans reported as frauds are classified as loss assets 
and fully provided for immediately without considering the 
value of security.
The Bank maintains general provision for standard assets 
including credit exposures computed as per the current 
marked to market values of interest rate and foreign 
exchange derivative contracts and gold. The Bank also 
maintains general provision for unhedged foreign currency 
exposures of borrowers, provision on loans to specific 
borrowers in specific stressed sectors, provision on 
exposures to step-down subsidiaries of Indian companies 
and provision on specified borrowers as prescribed by 
RBI. In the case of overseas branches, general provision 
on standard assets is maintained at the higher of the 
levels stipulated by the respective overseas regulator or 
RBI. The provision for standard assets is included under 
other liabilities.
In addition to the above, the Bank on a prudent basis 
makes provision on advances or exposures which are not 
NPAs but has reasons to believe on the basis of the extant 
environment or specific information or basis regulatory 
guidance / instructions, of a possible slippage of a specific 
advance or a group of advances or exposures or potential 
exposures. These are classified as contingent provisions 
and included under other liabilities.
Provision made in addition to the Bank’s policy for specific 
loan loss provision for non-performing assets, possible 
slippage of specific exposures and regulatory general 
provision is categorised as floating provision. Creation of 
floating provision is considered by the Bank up to a level 
approved by the Board of Directors. Floating provisions 
are used only for contingencies under extraordinary 
circumstances and for making specific provisions for nonperforming accounts. Floating provisions are included 
under other liabilities.
Further to the provisions required to be held according 
to the asset classification status, provision is held for 
individual country exposures (other than for home country 
exposure). Countries are categorised into risk categories 
as per Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd. 
(‘ECGC’) guidelines and provisioning is made in respect 
of that country where the net funded exposure is one 
percent or more of the Bank’s total assets. Provision for 
country risk is included under other liabilities.
In accordance with the RBI guidelines on the prudential 
framework for resolution of stressed assets and the 
resolution frameworks for COVID-19 related stress and 
its Board approved policy, the Bank has implemented 
resolution plans for eligible borrowers. The asset 
classification and necessary provision thereon is made in 
accordance with the said RBI guidelines. The restructured 
loans are upgraded into standard category as per the 
extant RBI guidelines. Further, in respect of restructuring 
of loans pertaining to projects under implementation, the

SCHEDULES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
As at March 31, 2024
asset classification and necessary provision thereon is 
made in accordance with the said RBI guidelines.
Non Banking finance companies 
Classification:
Advances are classified as standard, sub-standard and 
doubtful assets as per the policy approved by the Board 
of the respective entity and as per RBI guidelines. The 
rates applied for making provisions on non-performing 
assets (NPA) are higher than those prescribed by the 
relevant RBI guidelines. Interest on non-performing 
assets is transferred to an interest suspense account 
and not recognised in the Consolidated Profit and Loss 
Account until received. Advances are recognised on 
disbursement of loan and in case of new asset financing 
on the transfer of ownership. The non-banking finance 
entity provides 0.40% on standard assets as stipulated 
by RBI guidelines. The NBFCs assesses all advances for 
their recoverability and accordingly recognises provision 
for non-performing and doubtful assets as per approved 
policies and guidelines. The non-banking finance entity 
ensures provisions made are not lower than as stipulated 
by RBI guidelines.
Loan origination costs:
Brokerage, commission, incentive to employee, etc. paid 
at the time of acquisition of loans are charged to expenses.
Life Insurance
 
Classification:
Advances are classified as performing and non-performing 
and are valued at historical cost and are stated net of loan 
loss provision.
Provisioning:
All assets where the interest and / or instalment of 
principal repayment remain overdue for more than 90 
days at the Balance Sheet date are classified as nonperforming assets (NPA) and provided for in the manner 
required by the IRDAI regulations on this behalf. In line 
with the guidelines on prudential norms for income 
recognition, asset classification, provisioning, and other 
related matters in respect of debt portfolio, life insurance 
entity has provided minimum percentage on the value of 
the standard assets. The provision for standard assets is 
included under other liabilities.
Non-performing advances are written-off in accordance 
with the policy as approved by the Board of life insurance 
entity. Recoveries from bad debts written-off are included 
under other income.
Securitisation and transfer of assets
Assets transferred through securitisation and direct 
assignment of cash flows are de-recognised in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet when they are sold (true sale 
criteria being fully met with) and consideration is received. 
Sales / transfers that do not meet true sale criteria are 
accounted for as borrowings. For a securitisation or direct 
assignment transaction, the Group recognises profit upon 
receipt of the funds and loss is recognised at the time 
of sale.
On sale of stressed assets, if the sale is at a price 
below the net book value (i.e., funded outstanding less 
specific provisions held), the shortfall is charged to the 
Consolidated Profit and Loss Account and if the sale is 
for a value higher than the net book value, the excess 
provision is credited to the Consolidated Profit and Loss 
Account in the year when the sum of cash received by 
way of initial consideration and / or redemption or transfer 
of security receipts issued by Securitisation Company 
(‘SC’) / Reconstruction Company (‘RC’) exceeds the net 
book value of the loan at the time of transfer.
In respect of stressed assets sold under an asset 
securitisation, where the investment by the Group in SRs 
issued against the assets transferred by it is more than 10 
percent of such SRs, provisions held against outstanding 
SRs are higher of the provisions required in terms of net 
asset value declared by the SC / RC and provisions 
as per the extant norms applicable to the underlying 
loans, notionally treating the book value of these SRs as 
the corresponding stressed loans assuming the loans 
remained in the books of the Group. 
The Group invests in PTCs issued by Special Purpose 
Vehicles (SPVs). These are accounted at acquisition cost 
and are classified as investments. The Group also buys 
loans through the direct assignment route which are 
classified as advances. These are carried at acquisition 
cost unless it is more than the face value, in which case 
the premium is amortised based on effective interest 
rate method.
The Bank transfers advances through inter-bank 
participation with and without risk. In the case of 
participation with risk, the aggregate amount of the 
participation issued by the Bank is reduced from 
advances. In case where the Bank is assuming risk by 
participation, the aggregate amount of the participation 
HDFC Bank Limited
4 3 8

is classified under advances. In the case of issue of 
participation certificate without risk, the aggregate amount 
of participation issued by the Bank is classified under 
borrowings and where the Bank is acquiring participation 
certificate, the aggregate amount of participation acquired 
is shown as due from banks under advances.
Fixed assets and depreciation
Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation as adjusted for impairment, if any. Cost 
includes cost of purchase and all expenditure like site

Stock based Employee Compensation:
The Employee Stock Option Scheme / Employee Stock 
Incentive Master Scheme formulated by Holding or 
subsidiary companies provides for the grant of options 
/ Restricted Stock Units (units) to eligible employees 
and whole-time directors to acquire equity shares of 
the entities they belong to. The options / units granted 
shall vest as per their vesting schedule and these may be 
exercised within a specified period. 
The Group followed the intrinsic value method to account 
for its stock-based employee compensation plans 
in respect of options granted up to March 31, 2021. 
Compensation cost was measured by the excess, if 
any, of the market price of the underlying stock over the 
exercise price as determined under the option plan. The 
market price is the closing price on the stock exchange 
where there is highest trading volume on the working 
day immediately preceding the date of grant. In case 
of unlisted subsidiaries, the fair value is considered in 
absence of market price.
Effective April 01, 2021, the fair value of share-linked 
instruments on the date of grant for all instruments granted 
after March 31, 2021, is recognised as an expense in 
accordance with the RBI guidelines on Compensation of 
Whole-Time Directors / Chief Executive Officers / Material 
Risk Takers and Control Function staff. The fair value of 
the stock-based employee compensation is estimated on 
the date of grant using Black-Scholes model. 
The compensation cost is amortised on a straight-line 
basis over the vesting period after adjusting estimated 
forfeiture as applicable. Ultimately, the cost for all 
instruments that vest is recognised. The compensation 
expense is recognised in the Consolidated Profit and 
Loss Account with a corresponding credit to Employee 
Stock Options Outstanding. On exercise of the stock 
options, corresponding balance in Employee Stock 
Options Outstanding is transferred to Share Premium. 
In respect of the options which expire unexercised, the 
balance standing to the credit of Employee Stock Options 
Outstanding is transferred to General Reserve.

of lump sum amount, without an upper limit, equivalent 
to 15 days’* basic salary payable for each completed 
year of service to all eligible employees on resignation,

The guidance note on implementing AS-15, Employee 
Benefits, states that benefits involving employer 
established provident funds, which require interest 
shortfalls to be provided, are to be considered as defined 
benefit plan. Actuarial valuation of this Provident Fund 
interest shortfall is done as per the guidance note issued 
in this respect by The Institute of Actuaries of India (IAI) 
and provision towards this liability is made.
The overseas branches of the Bank make contribution 
to the respective applicable government social security 
scheme calculated as a percentage of the employees’

payments are apportioned between the finance charges 
and the corresponding liability to achieve a constant rate 
of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance 
charges are charged to the Consolidated Profit and Loss 
Accounts. Leased assets capitalised under finance 
lease are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term.
16. Reserve for unexpired risk
General insurance
Reserve for unexpired risk represents that part of the net 
premium written which is attributable to and allocated to 
the succeeding accounting period. Reserve for unexpired 
risk is calculated on the basis of 1/365th method in all 
segments subject to a minimum of 100% in case of 
marine hull business. 
17. Policyholders’ funds
Life Insurance
The actuarial liabilities, for all in force policies and policies 
where premiums are discontinued but a liability exists as 
at the valuation date, are calculated in accordance with 
the generally accepted actuarial principles and practices, 
requirements of Insurance Act, 1938 as amended from 
time to time including amendment brought by the 
HDFC Bank Limited
4 4 6

Insurance Laws (Amendment) Act, 2015, regulations 
notified by the IRDAI and Actuarial Practice Standard 
(APS) issued by the Institute of Actuaries of India with the 
concurrence of the IRDAI. These liabilities are presented 
as a part of Policyholders Funds on liability side of the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The specific principles adopted for the valuation of policy 
liabilities are set out as per the IRDAI (Assets, Liabilities and 
Solvency Margin of Life Insurance Business) Regulations, 
2016 and the APS2 & APS7 issued by the Institute of 
Actuaries of India.
A brief of the methodology used is as given below:
The policy liabilities are valued on policy by policy
basis, i.e., each policy is valued separately.
The reserves for linked business (individual and
group) comprise unit reserves and non-unit reserves. 
The unit reserves are determined on the basis of 
NAV of the units outstanding as at the valuation date 
and non-unit reserves are calculated using gross 
premium valuation method.
The liabilities for individual non-linked nonparticipating and participating business are 
calculated using gross premium valuation method 
and are subject to the minimum floor of surrender 
value. Additionally, individual non-linked participating 
policies also have a reference to the asset share of 
policies at valuation date.
The liabilities for one year renewable group protection
business are calculated on the unexpired risk 
premium basis. For other than one year renewable 
group protection business, the liabilities are 
calculated using gross premium valuation method.
The liabilities for the group non-linked savings
products are determined as the higher of policy 
account balances (including accrued interest /
bonuses) and reserves calculated by gross premium 
valuation method.
The liabilities in respect of rider benefits are
determined as the higher of unexpired premium 
reserves and reserves calculated by gross premium 
valuation method.
Additional reserves are determined to:
allow for the claims that may have occurred already
but not yet reported (Incurred but Not Reported).
allow for the servicing of existing policies if Life
Insurance were to close the new business one year 
from the valuation date (Closure to New Business).
meet the expected liabilities that would arise on
the revival of lapsed policies, on the basis of the 
proportion of the policies expected to be revived 
based on the revival experience of Life Insurance 
(Revival Reserve).
allow for the additional amount required to be paid
on account of cancellation of policies due to look 
in, on the basis of the proportion of the policies 
expected to exercise the look-in option based on 
the experience Life Insurance (Look-in Reserve).
allow for the cost of guarantees, wherever applicable.
The Funds for Future Appropriations (FFA), in the 
participating segment, represents the surplus, which 
is not allocated to policyholders or shareholders as 
at the Balance Sheet date. Transfers to and from 
the fund reflect the excess or deficit of income over 
expenses respectively and appropriations in each 
accounting period arising in the Policyholders’ Fund. 
Any allocation to the par policyholders would also 
give rise to a transfer to Consolidated Profit and Loss 
Account in the required proportion.
18. Reinsurance premium ceded
Life Insurance
Reinsurance premium ceded is accounted for on due 
basis in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 
reinsurance treaties. Profit commission on reinsurance 
ceded (if applicable) is netted off against premium ceded 
on reinsurance.
General Insurance 
Reinsurance premium ceded is accounted in the year in 
which the risk commences and over the period of risk 
in accordance with the treaty arrangements with the 
reinsurers. Reinsurance premium ceded on unearned 
premium is carried forward to the period of risk and is set 
off against related unearned premium. Any subsequent

The Group reports basic and diluted earnings per equity 
share in accordance with AS-20, Earnings per Share. 
Basic earnings per equity share has been computed 
by dividing net profit for the year attributable to equity 
shareholders by the weighted average number of equity 
shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings 
per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur 
if securities or other contracts to issue equity shares 
were exercised or converted to equity during the year. 
Diluted earnings per equity share are computed using 
the weighted average number of equity shares and the 
dilutive potential equity shares outstanding during the 
period except where the results are anti-dilutive.

Liabilities and Contingent Assets, the Group recognises 
provisions when it has a present obligation as a result of 
a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources 
embodying economic benefits will be required to settle 
the obligation and when a reliable estimate of the amount 
of the obligation can be made. 
Provisions are determined based on management estimate 
required to settle the obligation at the Balance Sheet date, 
supplemented by experience of similar transactions. 
These are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and 
adjusted to reflect the current management estimates. 
A disclosure of contingent liability is made when there is:
a possible obligation arising from a past event,
the existence of which will be confirmed by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more 
uncertain future events not within the control of the 
Group; or
a present obligation arising from a past event which
is not recognised as it is not probable that an outflow 
of resources will be required to settle the obligation 
or a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation 
cannot be made.
When there is a possible obligation or a present obligation 
in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of resources 
is remote, no provision or disclosure is made. Contingent 
assets, if any, are not recognised in the financial statements 
since this may result in the recognition of income that may 
never be realised.

hand, rupee digital currency with RBI, balances with 
RBI, balances with other banks and money at call and

For the year ended March 31, 2024
The Board of Directors at its meeting held on December 15, 2022 approved certain amendments to the ESOP-2021 to 
inter alia amend the definition of holding company in view of the amalgamation of eHDFC Limited with and into HDFC 
Bank, the vesting schedule / conditions and annual purchase obligation of the holding company to align the same with the 
revised vesting schedule / conditions, subject to the approval of the Shareholders of HDFC Capital. The remaining terms 
and conditions including procedure of grant, appraisal process, exercise price, exercise period etc. remained the same. 
The shareholders of HDFC Capital at the extra-ordinary general meeting held on December 19, 2022 approved the aforesaid 
amendments to the ESOP–2021.
Subject to fulfilling the conditions specified in ESOP-2021 and in terms of the revised vesting schedule 50% of the options 
granted shall vest on the completion of 1 (one) year from the grant date, 25% of the options granted shall vest on the 
completion of 2 (two) years from the grant date and remaining 25% of the options granted shall vest on the completion of 
3 (three) years.
Estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions requires use of an appropriate valuation model. HDFC Capital 
measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with Option holders using Black-Scholes-Merton formula to determine 
the fair value of the options on the grant date. Inputs into the valuation model, includes assumption such as the expected 
term of the share option, volatility, dividend yield and discount rate. 
The fair value of the options determined at grant date is accounted as employee compensation cost over the vesting period, 
based on the plan.

Provident fund
The guidance note on AS-15, Employee Benefits, states that employer established provident funds, where interest is 
guaranteed are to be considered as defined benefit plans and the liability has to be valued. The Institute of Actuaries of 
India (IAI) has issued a guidance note on valuation of interest rate guarantees on exempt provident funds. The actuary has 
accordingly valued the same and as at March 31, 2024, no provision is required (previous year: Nil), towards the present 
value of the guaranteed interest benefit obligation. The actuary has followed the deterministic approach as prescribed by 
the guidance note.

Contingent liability*
Brief description

Claims against the Bank not 
acknowledged as debts - taxation
The Group is a party to various taxation matters in respect of which appeals are 
pending. 
The Group expects the outcome of the appeals to be favorable based on decisions 
on similar issues in the previous years by the appellate authorities, based on the 
facts of the case and taxation laws.

Claims against the Bank not 
acknowledged as debts - others
The Group is a party to various legal proceedings in the normal course of business.
The Group does not expect the outcome of these proceedings to have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s financial conditions, results of operations or cash 
flows.

Partly paid investments
This represents amount remaining unpaid towards liability for partly paid 
investments.

Liability on account of forward 
exchange and derivative contracts
The Group enters into foreign exchange contracts, currency options, forward 
rate agreements, currency swaps and interest rate swaps with inter-bank 
participants on its own account and for customers. Forward exchange contracts 
are commitments to buy or sell foreign currency at a future date at the contracted 
rate. Currency swaps are commitments to exchange cash flows by way of interest 
/ principal in one currency against another, based on predetermined rates. Interest 
rate swaps are commitments to exchange fixed and floating interest rate cash flows. 
The notional amounts of financial instruments such as foreign exchange contracts 
and derivatives provide a basis for comparison with instruments recognised on the 
Balance Sheet but do not necessarily indicate the amounts of future cash flows 
involved or the current fair value of the instruments and, therefore, do not indicate 
the Group’s exposure to credit or price risks. The derivative instruments become 
favorable (assets) or unfavorable (liabilities) as a result of fluctuations in market 
rates or prices relative to their terms.

Guarantees given on behalf 
of constituents, acceptances, 
endorsements and other obligations
As a part of its commercial banking activities, the Bank issues documentary credit 
and guarantees on behalf of its customers. Documentary credits such as letters of 
credit enhance the credit standing of the Bank’s customers. Guarantees generally 
represent irrevocable assurances that the Bank will make payments in the event of 
the customer failing to fulfill its financial or performance obligations.

Other items for which the Bank is 
contingently liable
These include: a) Credit enhancements in respect of securitised-out loans; b) Bills 
rediscounted by the Bank; c) Capital commitments; d) Underwriting commitments;
e) Investment purchases pending settlement; f) Amount transferred to the RBI
under the Depositor Education and Awareness Fund (DEAF); g) Bank guarantees 
taken.

the RBI vide its circular dated September 12, 2023 has revised the norms on classification, measurement and valuation of 
investments with effect from April 01, 2024. The revised framework updates the regulatory guidelines with global standards 
and best practices and introduced symmetric treatment of fair value gains and losses.

insurance entity and is in advanced stages of conclusion in case of general insurance entity.

COMMODITY PRICE RISKS AND FOREIGN 
EXCHANGE RISKS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
Being in the business of banking, as per the extant regulations, 
the Bank does not deal in any commodity, though, it can 
be exposed to the commodity price risks in its capacity as 
lender / banker to its customers. Currently, the Bank has open 
exposure in Precious Metals i.e., Gold / Silver and such open 
exposures in Gold / Silver are primarily on account of positions 
created from short term deposits under the Gold Monetization 
Scheme (GMS) raised from Customers and trading positions 
in Gold / Silver. These positions are managed similar to other 
foreign exchange exposures using spot, outright forwards 
and swap transactions in Gold/Silver and monitored as part 
of the trading portfolio within the stipulated trading risk limits 
viz. Net overnight open position limit, Intraday open position 
limit, Value-at-Risk limit, Stop Loss Trigger Level etc. that are 
defined in the Treasury Limits Package. In addition, Bank is 
authorized by RBI to import gold and silver and the exposure 
arising out of import of gold and silver on consignment basis 
is covered on back to back basis. The spot, forward and swap 
contracts, outstanding as on the Balance Sheet date and held 
for trading, are revalued at the closing spot and forward rates 
respectively as notified by FEDAI (Foreign Exchange Dealers’ 
Association of India) and at interpolated rates for contracts of 
interim maturities. The USD / INR rate for valuation of contracts 
having longer maturities i.e. greater than one (1) year is implied 
from the applicable INR and USD swap curves. For other pairs, 
where the rates / tenors are not published by FEDAI, the spot 
and forward points are obtained from Refinitiv or Bloomberg for 
valuation of the foreign exchange deals. The foreign exchange 
profit or loss is arrived on present value basis thereafter, as 
directed by FEDAI, whereby the forward profits or losses on 
the deals, as computed above, are discounted till the valuation 
date using the applicable discounting yields. The resulting profit 
or loss on valuation is recognized in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss.

Gold Monetization Scheme deposits as of March 31, 2024.

The objective of ‘leading responsibly’ has been a tenet HDFC 
Bank has followed since its inception in 1994. This entails 
a commitment to delivering quality customer experiences, 
taking banking to the unbanked, supporting businesses, 
enabling smart banking, focusing on long-term sustainability 
and empowering communities. Unequivocally, the business of 
banking is underpinned by trust and as a responsible lender, 
the Bank stands committed to contributing to nation building.
FY 2023-24 marks an exceptional year, as it is the first 
year of reporting post the merger of the erstwhile Housing 
Development Finance Corporation Limited (e-HDFC) with 
HDFC Bank with effect from July 1, 2023. The rationale for the 
merger has been well articulated as have the synergies of the 
combined entity. Given the scale of the merger, as with the 
financials, there is a new starting point for non-financial metrics 
as well. Thus, the current year’s numbers are not comparable 
with that of the prior period.
Prior to the merger, an Integration Committee was set up 
to facilitate a seamless and effective integration. Having 
spearheaded the Integration Committee, suffice to say that 
ESG was among the core focus areas. Culture, people, 
processes and systems are the key pillars of building longterm sustainable businesses.
The board believes that governance and sustainability 
are inextricably linked and essential to ensure long-term value 
creation. Though ESG frameworks are still evolving, the Board 
is committed to deepening its oversight on ESG and climaterelated disclosures.
BUS INES S RESPONS IBILIT Y AND SUSTAINABILIT Y REPORT
With concerted effort, the Bank has seen a significant 
improvement in its diversity and retention ratios which 
augurs well. The Bank is committed to playing a meaningful 
role in supporting the government’s flagship schemes – be 
it micro-insurance, pensions, MSME funding and initiatives 
in digitalisation, agriculture, healthcare, livelihoods, amongst 
others. The Bank was awarded the ‘Conscious Corporate of 
the Year’ at the ET Awards, 2023 – an acknowledgement of our 
efforts on Corporate Social Responsibility and ESG.
During the year, the Bank raised its maiden international 
sustainable bond, which was well received by investors. 
The Bank has widened its coverage of wholesale loans that 
undergo Environmental and Social due diligence. Leveraging 
on the deep corporate relationships, the Bank recognises the 
importance of being enablers of transition financing to shift to 
cleaner energy pathways.
The Bank is committed to raising the bar on its ESG disclosures. 
More importantly, the Bank abides by the principles of integrity, 
transparency and accountability in its ESG reporting.

Note: The Bank makes capex towards its physical infrastructure, including energy efficiency. The Bank also has capex 
towards its digitalisation initiatives which results in faster and greater efficiencies for customers. From an environmental 
perspective, this enables reduction in consumption of paper. The Bank on an annual basis spends ~6 to 7% of its overall 
expenses on technology-related areas. However, given the nature of the business of the Bank, it does not per se undertake 
R&D in technologies in the environmental space.
a. Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes / No)
Wherever feasible, the Bank tries to incorporate sustainable sourcing in its operations. For procurement of quipment, 
the Bank ensures that energy efficiency standards are considered during the purchase of electronic equipment such as 
computers, laptops, lighting devices, ACs amongst others.
As of March 31, 2024, the Bank had 2,026 branches/offices in different cities, certified under the Green Interiors Rating 
System of Indian Green Building Council (IGBC). These green office ratings entailed Platinum, Gold and Silver ratings 
from IGBC.
IGBC’s comprehensive rating modules encompassing eco design approach, interior materials, water conservation, indoor 
environment, energy efficiency and innovation in interior design have been incorporated at the Bank’s green certified 
premises. The Bank has been using GreenPro certified materials such as plywood, laminates, flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, 
paints, adhesives and finishes in these premises.
The Bank has also adopted #MissionZeroPaper to reduce paper usage in the day-to-day operations. Wherever feasible, 
the Bank replaces the use of virgin paper with recycled paper.
b. If yes, what % of goods were sourced sustainably?
The percentage of sustainable sourcing has not been aggregated.
Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the
end of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.
The Bank does not have ‘physical’ product offerings in the normal course of its operations and hence reclamation of 
products is not applicable given the nature of the banking business.
Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity’s activities (Yes / No). If yes,
whether the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted 
to Pollution Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.

Note: With the merger of Housing Development Finance Corporation (e-HDFC) with HDFC Bank with effect from July 1, 
2023, the Bank opted for a sustainable disposal of the flex of e-HDFC’s signages which had to be changed. On a panIndia basis, all the signage convertor vendors were requested to handover the flex to cement factories for co-processing. 
Accordingly, 6.76 tonnes of flex from 560 locations were collected and handed over to 5 cement companies. Certificates 
were obtained from the cement companies that the waste would be co-processed and the same was deemed as nonhazardous waste.
Of the input materials relevant for provision of banking services, recycled paper is one of the material inputs. In FY 23-24, 
recycled paper constituted 7.07% of our total paper procurement which reduces the upstream emissions associated with 
paper procurement. Other than that, no such recyclable or reusable input in material quantities is applicable for providing 
banking services.

business operations, goods, services, and solutions, reduction of reputational risk, and positive impact on our internal and 
external environments. The engagements include town halls, training sessions, social media platforms, customer satisfaction 
surveys, stakeholder engagement exercises, and materiality exercises. The Board and senior management are informed of 
the feedback from a wide variety of stakeholders in order to get their advice and take appropriate action. Through its various

and social topics - which serves as inputs for decision-making by the Board. These include, but are not limited to:
The Bank’s Board-level Customer Service Committee is constituted to bring about continuous improvements in the
quality of customer services provided by the Bank and bring out innovative measures for enhancing the customer

and social topics (Yes/No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders 
on these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.
Yes. The Bank engages with its key stakeholders on an ongoing basis to identify pertinent environmental and social topics 
of interest to its stakeholders and addresses them through periodic updates through policies and programmes. The Bank 
reviewed its material topics through consultations with multiple stakeholder groups. The exercise was designed to identify 
how various areas impact the Bank’s stakeholders. For each of the material topics identified through this consultation 
process, the Bank has a robust approach, as detailed in its Integrated Annual Report. The Bank will continue to align its 
overall strategy in line with material topics identified.
To quote a few examples, the Bank had aligned its ESG reporting with the requirements of SEBI which is one of its key 
stakeholders. Additionally, the Bank ensures compliance with the requirements of RBI as updated from time to time. The 
Bank is also cognizant of the evolving needs of its customers and offers new products to cater to customers’ preference 
for ease of transactions across channels. Similarly, the Bank continues to offer new technology driven, best-in-class 
learning resources to its employees to cater to their learning and development needs. The Bank’s CSR programmes are 
also designed to cater to the local needs and context of the communities they are designed to serve.
Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable /
marginalised stakeholder groups.
With the guidance of the Board governed Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Policy, the Bank remains committed to

and interventions aimed at improving their well-being and contributing to their sustainable development.
The Bank is also committed to lending to marginal/vulnerable groups through its Sustainable Livelihoods Initiative.

Note: 
Scope 1 emissions include emissions from company-owned cars, company-owned diesel gensets, fugitive emissions 
from air conditioners and fire extinguishers. 
Two sources of GHG emissions i.e. air conditioners and fire extinguishers have been included for Scope 1 emissions
for FY 23-24, which were not included in Scope 1 emissions for FY 22-23.
For the computation of emissions from company-owned cars and company-owned gensets, emission factors from
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines 2006 have been applied to quantities deemed for 
energy consumption in Principle 6, Essential Indicators: Question 1.
Fugitive emissions for fire extinguishers are estimated using operational database and public factors on leakage from
USEPA’s guidance, with Global Warming Potential (GWP) values derived from the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR 6).
For air conditioners (ACs), the Bank’s Fixed Asset Register for ACs sets the boundary, with asset characteristics
derived from internal databases. Emissions have been calculated using India’s refrigerant trends, average capacity 
of refrigerant as provided by vendors, refrigerant leakage as considered from Council on Energy, Environment and 
Water (CEEW)and GWP derived factors from IPCC AR 6.
Scope 2 emissions are reported using market-based approach with grid emission factor from Version 19 of the Central 
Electrical Authority’s CO2 database. 
Scope 1 & 2 emission intensity has been computed based on Total Revenue which includes Interest Earned under
Schedule 13 and Other Income, excluding profit/(loss) on sale of buildings & other assets (net) under Schedule 14 of 
the Audited Standalone Financial Statements of the Bank.
For the purpose of calculation of intensity adjusted Purchasing power parity (PPP), conversion factor @22.88 `/USD
as per OECD has been considered.
Indicate if any independent assessment / evaluation / assurance has been carried out by an external agency? 
If yes, name of the external agency.
Yes, an independent assurance has been carried out by Price Waterhouse LLP for the FY 23-24 indicators in the table above.
Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If yes, then provide details.
Yes. The Bank is cognisant of its impact on the environment and is actively engaged in reducing its energy consumption 
and emissions across its operations. Automated energy management solutions are deployed at some of the branches, 
which helps monitor energy consumption and control usage. This initiative is now active at 568 branches and has resulted 
in savings of 16% on electricity, amounting to about 4.19 million units (kWh) in FY 23-24.
Implementation of static Power Factor (PF) solutions through the installation of Active Harmonic Filter (AHF) was another 
project rolled out in FY 23-24 that aims to address the correction of power factor and bring in efficiencies at the branch 
locations. The project was implemented at 86 locations and electricity savings amounted to close to 0.16 million units (kWh) 
in FY 23-24.
Wherever feasible, the Bank has also been trying to integrate renewable energy sources into the overall power consumption. 
The Bank has 25 rooftop solar plants with a cumulative capacity of about 720 kWp across the country. The Bank also 
procures green power at a premium tariff through DISCOMs at 12 locations in Maharashtra. With the procurement of 
over 2,639.18 MWh during FY 23-24, about 1,889.66 metric tonnes of carbon emissions were avoided during the year. To 
adopt a more holistic approach to emission reduction, the Bank has been evaluating all new projects for feasibility of green 
certification by the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC). As of March 31, 2024, 2,026 branches and offices received green 
certifications from IGBC.

10. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy
adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes 
and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
The Bank does not use hazardous and toxic chemicals in its products and processes. However, the Bank has been working 
towards sustainable management of waste generated from day-to-day operations. The Bank has formulated an internal 
Standard Operating Procedure to document its approach to waste segregation and handling in the office premises. The 
Bank segregates and recycles dry waste at select large offices. The dry waste from these offices is collected and disposed 
through authorised vendors who eventually recycle the waste. In FY 23-24, disposal of the Bank’s owned IT assets within its 
premises and its co-located datacenters led to the generation and recycling of 110.58 tonnes of e-waste and 20.51 tonnes 
of battery waste. The e-waste and battery waste was handed over to authorized recyclers, thus ensuring circularity.
11. If the entity has operations / offices in / around ecologically sensitive areas (such as national parks, wildlife
sanctuaries, biosphere reserves, wetlands, biodiversity hotspots, forests, coastal regulation zones etc.) where 
environmental approvals/clearances are required, please specify details.

Deduction of tax at source on dividend 
In terms of the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961, (“the 
Act”), dividend paid or distributed by a Company on or after 
April 1, 2020 is taxable in the hands of the shareholders. The 
Company shall therefore be required to deduct tax at source at 
the time of payment of dividend. The deduction of tax at source 
will be based on the category of shareholders and subject to 
fulfilment of conditions as provided herein below: 
For Resident shareholders
Tax will be deducted at source (“TDS”) under Section 
194 of the Act @ 10% on the amount of dividend payable 
unless exempt under any of the provisions of the Act. 
However, in case of resident shareholders, TDS would not 
apply if the aggregate of total dividend distributed/paid 
to them by the Company during a financial year does not 
exceed ` 5,000/-. 
Tax will not be deducted at source in cases where 
a shareholder provides Form 15G (applicable to all 
individuals) / Form 15H (applicable to an individual above 
the age of 60 years), provided that the eligibility conditions 
are satisfied. Please note that all fields mentioned in the
