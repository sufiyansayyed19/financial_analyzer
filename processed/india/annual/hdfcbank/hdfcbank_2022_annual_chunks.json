Home loans are an emotional product and bring with \nthem a host of accelerated benefits for the Bank. Today \nthe environment for buying a home has changed. RERA \nhas ensured greater transparency in the process. Price \ncorrections in the property market have seen inventories \ncome down. Also, rising incomes mean that home loan EMIs \nhave come down as a percentage of a person’s income. \nThanks to the penetration of telecom, internet and television \nservices, the desire to own better homes has increased \nacross the country. All this means that housing is going to \nbe a huge growth opportunity and one of the key drivers of \nIndia’s GDP over the next decade.\nFurther, only 2% of our customers source their home loans",

And about 70% of HDFC Ltd.’s \ncustomers do not bank with us. All these give us an idea \nabout the size of the opportunity. The long tenor nature of \nhome loans provides resiliency to the balance sheet. The \nBank is one of the largest consumer durable financiers in \nthe country.
